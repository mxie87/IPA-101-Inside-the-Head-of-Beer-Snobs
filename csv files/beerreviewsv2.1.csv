A 16 oz can dated 4/20/18 poured into a Tree House teku. 
"Smell: This has that huge yeasty pink bubblegum note that is just bursting out of the glass. Along with huge tropical fruits. Pineapple chunks, mango, papaya, watermelon, apricot, mandarin oranges. There isn’t really any malt presence to speak off. This is just an amazing smelling beer full of fruit and bubblegum. Probably the best nose I’ve smelled on a treehouse beer."
"April 25th 2018 release (drank on same day). I had written a review but having problems with my browser which deleted it. I'll shorten it to, KJ was great but didn't live up to the first time I had Julius. The mouthfeel still is incredible, just something different."
Finally getting to try this after getting mixed reviews when comparing to the previous release of this long-awaited re-release.
Canned 4/20/18; drank 5/5/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"April 2017 release. Canned two weeks ago, released a week and a half ago."
"Great beer but definitely a heavy one. It tastes closer to a mimosa than a typical dipa. tons of orange flavor, not a ton of carbonation. Still an amazing beer though."
"I have been waiting for this beer since I first tried Julius back in Monson. I like the beer but pre a Charlton Julius has this beat. It pours a little burnt orange, the smell at first glance is not as floral as expected but after warming a little hints of a resinous (ala Galaxy) citrous amalgamation emerge. The taste is initially more bitter and dry than expected with a bright perky finish . Mouthfeel is rich creamy and complex Overall a very good beer. Worth $100 an ""empty ""can on ebay - NO. Was in worth the wait - hmmm I only tried one can so TBD, I think a lot of hype and expectation follow this variant around. Personally I can say I have been happy that TH is producing ""adequate""quantities of beer. Volume, however, does not necessarily go hand in had with quality. I have been very happy with some of the Charlton product, but in more cases than expected, I have felt let down. Its not the rarity factor, its the quantity factor. I have not yet had that OMG this is a perfect growler of AE, Julius or Haze from Charlton. I have loved some of the new dark beers from the new place, HOTS, the one with the excessively long name, DS. When waiting in line I can see the angst in Nates body language and know that he is certainly trying his best. I love TH and look forward to the day when I have another perfect growler of Julius but for now..."
One of the best beers I have ever had.
OMG
It’s spiritual!!! Listen to your favorite music and prepare to enjoy!!!!!
"Such an incredible upgrade from regular Julius; pineapple, peach, juicy hops, super smooth, crisp yet lingering body; delightful concert of flavors."
"Super rare probably the best beer I’ve ever had, it’s a tough statement but it’s amazing definitely top 3. The aroma, taste, if I ever got married I would want her to be like this beer LOL!"
Pours out cloudy looks like a typical new england style IPA. You can't see through it and its hard to even see light through it. Tastes like the perfect balance between orange juice (minus the tang) and an IPA.
First ever IPA so it was a little bold for an unrefined pallet. Even still it's one of the best I've had.
"Canned on 9/2. If I didn't know it was 3 months old, I wouldn't have been able to tell. As long as this beer is refridgerated, this beer holds up well."
Hands down best beer I've had
Super juicy. Lots of fruit forward hops and no bite. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel.
"I received this by mail from a generous friend. Even after all abuse it took in transit, still that lucious mouth filling juice bomb. There is an explosion of flavor that brings forward grapefruit and mango and settles into a long lovely finish. Extraordinary!"
"Had 2/8/16 at Nate's house out of a growler from the brewery. It truly is King! Its exceptional mouthfeel and tropical, (I hate saying) juicy flavor make this one for the ages."
"Truly a work of art. This beer is a turbid/opaque orange. Sublime lacing. So tropical in the nose, lots of sweet/chocolate covered oranges on the palate with the creamsicle soft mouthfeel. There is a hop bite after the smooth sweetness up front. I think I prefer Julius to King Julius in terms of drinkability, but they are masterclass brews. Very Hazy is an echelon all on its own though."
So aptly named. There can only be one king of beers and it's not Budweiser but King Julius!
One of the best Citrusy IPAs I have ever drank. Looked and smelled like a glass of fresh squeezed juice. Best beer of the year for me!
Poured from a 16oz can dated 9-2-16
Was really excited to try this. Not at all what I thought it would be. This is the definition of balance. Lots of citrusy sweet fruits and nice malt backbone to round it out.
Had twice from a growler and once from a can on three separate occasions.
"Canned Sept. 2, 2016, enjoyed Sept. 27, 2016"
Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 9/2/2016.
Appearance- Dark/burnt golden color with an almost brown hue to it. Pours a fizzy two finger head.
Super hazy. It looks like orange juice.
I've only had a few of these NE style ipas and was waiting until I had a really highly rated one to weigh in.
Less than 10 days old can into a teku glass.
Poured from the can into a tulip. Hazy orange juice bomb with an elite mouthfeel with really sets it apart from other top notch DIPAs. On par with JJJ/KJJJ.
Here is the thing. I think this is a great beer. That being said ...
Can received in trade with Kevin.
Simply one of the best beers I have ever had bar none.
"Pour is a murky tan orange with a bubbly head that retains and laces nicely. Aromas orange zest, mango and peach jump out of the glass. The flavor is jam packed with mango, orange, light citrus and very mild bitterness on the back end, with a light grainy backbone. The mouth feel is thick, lush and smooth, with mild carbonation. The only knock on this beer is that it is not noticeably better than its little brother, Julius. Of course, one of the best things about this beer is that it tastes very similar to its delicious little brother, Julius."
fresh can drank on 9/9/2016
"Strange to have this before regular Julius, but still so happy that I got a can. This truly is, quite simply, the best hoppy beer I have ever had. Didn't think anything could pass the other king (Sue that is), but this is truly phenomenal."
"Simply the best beer I've ever had. Huge citrus aromas as soon as I cracked the can, and the taste followed the nose. Mouthfeel was tremendous with this beer. Basically a fruit smoothie. Worth trading for if you can find it."
Can shipped to Nebraska from Snifter.
First written review here. 
Lucky enough to drink this side by side with fresh Dinner.
Canned 9/2/16. Consumed 9/4/16.
Canned on 02Sep 2016 and enjoyed the same day. Poured into a Duvel Tulip. 
"Well, this beer is as close to perfect as I can image. Besides its signature unpolished Tree House look, this beer is as good as it gets. Huge aromas that are beautifully smooth--orange and mango are rounded out by citrus peel. The taste is every bit as good as the smell. It's juicy as $#*% and extremely well balanced, which is mind boggling. The citrusy bitter finish is what really does it. The feel is unparalleled. It's soft and full yet well carbed and not at all boozy. Overall this beer truly lives up to its hype."
"Damn this beer is fantastic!! Unreal smell or orange, peach, and mango. Smooth as can be with loads of citrus up front of course orange heavy. Oily finish zero malt also just like all treehouse beers. Love it"
Talk about a richness in beer choices from TreeHouse. This is an amazing beer but JJJulius and King JJJulius are a better version of this beer. Looking forward to tasting this beer in the future might be too fresh.
"Fresh, 2-day old can, chilled, and poured into a tulip glass."
"Pours ultra hazy, orange in color, with 1/3 inch head. Taste is deep peaches, orange juice, dragon fruit, light melon, and soft doughy bread. Heavy and full bodied with moderate carbonation. Like Julius but softer and with way more body. This has the best feel of any beer I have had period. Sweet with a touch of bitterness. Immaculate. Well worth the drive and a treat to drink. This and Very Hazy are two of the best beers I have had period."
It's hype train time!
"A little perspective - I don't live in New England, but still manage to get to Tree House a couple of times a years. Was standing in line a few Friday's ago in Monson when they announced that KJ available in cans -- needless to say, very excited. From the brewery to my iced cooler to a tulip 90 minutes later -- fully expecting to rant and rave. I am an unapologetic Tree House fan boy and normally find that their big name IPAs/DIPAs live up the hype -- until now. Don't get me wrong, this is a delicious beer, but best DIPA? #5 overall? Maybe in #5 among TH beers, but otherwise, I have to think the hype and rarity is driving more than the palate. Drinking my second can a couple of weeks later before writing the review -- wanted to give this one a second go."
"Just had my first taste! Waited in line less than an hour . Treehouse staff is amazingly effective. Got home, popped open a fresh one and man oh man....GREAT beer!"
Great beer I was able to enjoy at a tap takeover a while back ( makeup review ) 
Amazing.
"See the review of Julius, now take that on turbo mode... Honestly though, I would take Julius over this in a blind taste test. King J is a special treat, for sure, but the extra everything pushes this into the category of over the top. Very Green and Very Hazy do a much better job at pushing the limits while adding something special to the base beers. King J has the hype for sure, I mean, come on, you take perhaps the best IPA in the world, Julius, and put ""King"" in front of it? Craziness on all fronts. Still, and exceptional Treehouse offering, surprise surprise."
"This is one of only maybe 4-5 beers I've had that I would give an absolute perfect score. I was very lucky to have this as my very first Treehouse Beer when I wandered to Monson MA one fateful day to see what the brewery was all about, and it happened to be a King Julius release."
Quite possibly the perfect beer. Tremendous aroma and easy to drink. If you are a hop head this is the beer for you!
Everything about this beer screams DELICIOUS! 
"Had at Huna Day on a share. Was slightly old but would have expected it to hold up better for being a double. I also fully acknowledge I am a TG fanboy. I had alongside Julius, Todd the Axeman and Pseudo Sue. Thought regular Julius was way better but would but Todd the Axeman above all of them."
Probably best new imperial IPA i have had in a long time. better than HAZE
Amazing!
"Best Double IPA I've had the opportunity to try. Super juicy, so easy to drink. Absolutely worth the hype that it gets. Hope to get a ton more of this in the future"
"Truly fit for a King. A creamy tropical smoothie, incredibly soft on the pallet. Insanely juicy and thirst quenching, all hail King Julius! Tree house can do no wrong"
"Never thought I'd be doing this. Pours out haze4daze. Can't see a thing through it. Looks like orange juice. Smells like a fruit smoothie with orange, pineapple, peaches and other passion fruits. Taste is an explosive melange of smooth fruits. No way this is beer. So smooth and creamy. The best dipa and probably the best hoppy beer ever invented."
Poured a hazy juicy looking peach orange from the can. The nose didn't punch me in the face like Julius did but it still smells fantastic with citrus and tropical fruit aroma. The mouth feel was soft and it tasted so juicy with a very fleeting rind bitterness that just made this an excellent IPA.
"This just missed the mark for me. Still a nice beer, but I think the subtle juicyness and upping the hop & malt bill don't quite mix. The nose and taste add a distinctive vegetal flavor to the typical Julius ""straight juice homey"". I'll stick to the regular Julius for now."
"Good, but not amazing. Too much of a good thing maybe?"
"Can pours golden orange with great haze, juicy orange nose, amazingly smooth fruit, hops, juice blend. Great hop flavor with no bitterness whatsoever. As a huge fan of Julius, this was everything I had hoped for..."
Julius on steroids. simply amazing beer.
Hail to the King!
"Very good, lots of citrus in this beer, but not as balanced as Julius. Orange and tangerine came to mind, with a hint of grapefruit. Also some tropical fruit, mango and peach. The alcohol was present too. Overall very good beer, but not as good as I'd hoped."
"L- Golden Orange, a nice amount of white head on the pour, fairly hazy"
exceptional beer. have had it a few times now and is a total juice bomb. i love it but very green was better.
Sample at EBF 2016
"Wow! Poured from can into pint glass.. Sweet bouquet of fruits, hops and other residuals. Murky orange color with a solid white head that did not die. Well balanced and not as hoppy as I expected for a DIPA. Flavors rest well on the palate with moderate bitterness. Another outstanding beer by those at Treehouse!!"
"Had King Julius and Julius side by side, both fantastic beers, wish I had an endless supply of both."
"Pre-Doppelganger, a heavyweight bout of some Tree House big boys."
Best DIPA out there? Between this and Dinner imo.
"Had this at least 10 times, both out of the can and out of the growler, no more than a week old. No other beer I've had has made me burp up more hop flavor than KJ. Everything you love about Dr. J, but turned up to 11. Juicy beyond juicy, great out of the can or in a glass. A true treat. Trade whatever you can to get some of this fresh!"
"A: Pours a kind of ugly turbid brownish copper color with a nice, fluffy off-white head. Definitely not a looker, but neither are a lot of great beers. We move on."
"King Julius was the top hoppy beer for me at EBF. Everything I love about Julius, but taken up another notch. So juicy and so balanced for a double IPA. Tremendous."
"Anyone who has had Julius will know what they are in for with this one. Great pulpy, juicy flavor that is like a fresh squeezed glass of OJ. Pretty similar to the original, which I preferred a tad more (along with Curiosity 22). Both seemed to have a little better nose and brighter tropical flavors. Still, this is really great."
"Poured from a pint can into tulip glasses, purchased 1/29/16:"
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"Everything it's cracked up to be. Treehouse can do no wrong. Unicorns, show ponies , where's the beef! Amazing awesome fantastic, so good. Just trying to get to 150 characters."
"This was my first time trying any treehouse brew. I acquired a few of these in a trade, and I am blown away. The color is something ive never seen before, a hazy orange juice look. The aroma about knocked me out, and after tasting it... I'd be happy if this was the only brew I could drink for the rest of my life. Wow. This is the only time Ive given a perfect 5, and as hard as it is for me to do, this certainly deserves it."
"Opened a week after canning. After opening the can the room was immediately filled with big hop and fruit aromas. In the glass this smells like a giant glass of orange juice with every delicious juicy fruit mixed in. Just an amazing smell. This beer tastes like it smells, a wonderful juicy bomb of citrus and hoppiness. Minimal bitterness and a well balanced profile make the 8% alcohol in this beer dangerously hard to find. This is truly one of the best IPAs I have ever had. In my mind tied with King Sue and DDH Fort Point Pale Ale. Well worth what it takes to get this beer."
bought from brewery 1/30/16 and drank next day
"This is the best IPA / Double IPA I have ever had. It is somehow juicier than Julius and no boozy taste. It smells great and is absolutely delicious. I did a blind taste test with Julius, In Perptuity, and Alter Ego and this easily was the best out of the four beers. Hope to come across this one more often, hopefully Treehouse makes this one a regular."
I've been looking forward to this one forever. 750ml growler into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. 
750 ml. growler filled yesterday.
Perfect
"From growler. Burnt orange, orange juice. Multi finger froth head. Quick dissipation but a layer keeps as it goes down. Elite lacing. To steal my friend's description of the smell, it smells like the brewery. Well vice versa. Hint of malt with saturated hops with a fruit juiciness. A good bitterness element. Juice flavor shines. Anything and everything in that orange and grapefruit family. Like Charles Barkley gave them his Orange Bowl ""oranges"". Feels like carbonated juice. Like a shake/float but without anything that would be gross in an ipa. King indeed."
"Pours a very hazy burnt orange color with a thick creamy, pillowy head on that lingers nicely throughout. Thick, sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is orange, mango, bright tropical. Flavors reflect the same, very nice bitter flavor to balance with the sweetness of the tropical, mango, orange flavors. Drinks extremely smooth, like a tropical smoothie. Long live the King!"
Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery yesterday. 
"L: Typical treehouse look, bright orange hazy beer, burnt orange in the center. Frothy white head and a bit of lacing."
Canned on 12/3
"Pours an entirely clouded pineapple juice colored beer, with a one finger broad, bubbly head."
Although it is only produced a couple times a year. I was fortunate enough to get some to bring home. Absolutely delicious. Citrus flavor with a DIPA kick.
"Came to this with very high expectations. Looks fantastic in the glass like all Tree House IPAs. Aroma might be the best I've ever experienced from an IPA. Oranges, grapefruits, pineapples, papayas, and mangoes explode from the glass. The aroma is pungent. This fruit explosion doesn't follow through on the taste for me. There is a sweetness from the malt and the larger mouth feel makes it a little sticky, sappy, and resinous. This is nice, but it took away from the fruit somewhat. Fantastic beer. My criticism is only based on the expectation of 5.0. Definitely trade for this."
"KJ 16 oz can poured into a TH snifter. A hazy-orange color when poured into the glass. Had a good amount of carbonation with decent amount of head. The smell was amazing! Aromas of citrus, orange, tropical fruit, and small amount of funk. The taste, well... yeah... this one was delicious! One of the fruitiest offerings from TH outside of Juice Machine and a few others. The beer is extremely smooth, creamy and juicy with a nice hop finish to it. This if by far one of my favorite DIPAs to date! Definitely try to get your hands on a can (or more) if possible! Cheers!"
Appearance - Hazy. Almost opaque like orange juice. Thin head that dissipates quickly.
16oz can poured into a Treehouse Teku glass - Thanks Leo!
i could not get enough
Shared side by side with a Julius.
"This beer tastes like a grownup ""Julius"". More of a sophisticate taste with lots of juicy fruits and a grand finish to make you want to finish the whole bottle in one sitting."
Amazing nose. Beautiful cloudy look like all Tree House offerings. A one of a kind. Have it with seafood and be blown away.
"I thought Julius couldn't get any better, I was wrong. This beer did not disappoint. As soon as you crack the can you can tell how awesome it is. The tropical explosion starts with the aroma and stays all the way to the end with mango standing out above all the flavors to me. Amazing beer."
"Next to Dinner, this is the best double IPA ever!"
Was lucky enough to be able to trade away for a fresh can of the king… Poured a deep orange with a cloudy bottom kind of like a Mimosa. lots of citrus nose on this bad boy followed by a face full of grapefruit and citrusy hops !! I hope they continue to make this one on a regular basis because I will seek i I hope they continue to make this one on a regular basis because I will seek It out!!
Re review and rating. Had this on 9-10-16 from a 9-2-16 canning. Pours a turbid light yellow. Smells and tastes on par with orange juice that has been robbed of any sugar. Most impressive in my opinion was that I did not detect any bitterness in the finish.
Got cans and a growler from brewery. 
Pours a thick cloudy orange color. Has a huge citrus tropical fruit aroma. Flavor is delicious. Tropical fruit of papaya and mango with juicy citrus. Super smooth finish. Overall this is a great beer
"Everything about this beer is so tree house, and so delicous. Its so similar to Julius but with more tropical punch and more alcohol, but just as smooth as anything they make. yummy."
Look - The resemblance between this and straight orange juice is insane. The ideal look in my opinion. 
"Bottom line up front, this is an amazing beer. "
Pours a hazy yellow cloudy with a 1 inch head. Smells like an IPA with lots of orange juice and magi juice in it. Smooth juicy up front taste followed by nice bitter finish. Has a nice smooth mouthfeel.
"Cloudy dull orange in color, smell is ripe citrus, and taste follows, very juicy and orange orange with nice moderate hop finish. Juicier than Julius, not as creamy but still incredible."
"Having now had this a couple times in a week since its rerelease, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the perfect beer regardless of classification. Here's the thing it's not the first 5 that I've given out, and no doubt because Julius is perfect to me, I simply had to grade this the same- and normally when we compare beers that are a 97 vs a 98 there's just subtle nuances that distinguish them. This is the same only Julius is a 100, this is a 103- soft, citrus explosion w tremendous mouth feel and hop profile... seek w confidence, I suspect it'll be out more soon, but if you gotta friend, hit him up!"
"The appearance of this beautiful! Turbid, but cautious as not to appear ""murky"". Bright apricot/orange hue, just like the TH in the label. Stunner. #Hazefordaze"
"The beer comes in a medium gold color, extremely turbid. Mango smoothie color in a glass."
"16 oz. can. Hazy deep orange. Darker at the bottom of the pour, like peach juice where the pulp settles to the bottom. Smell is tropical fruits. Mango, orange. Some sweetness. Tastes tropical as well, with more emphasis on the orange flavor. Light sugary sweetness up front. Dries out and becomes a touch bitter in the finish. Medium body. Exactly as described. A bigger version of Julius. Drank a Julius before drinking this for science. It would be impossible to ramp up the hop flavor by the same order of magnitude that the sugars are amplified. By that metric, I think I would take Julius over this."
"16 oz can. Pours cloudy apricot-orange with thick white head that fades to a thin layer, coating lace. The aroma is sooooo juicy, orange and peach and plum. Taste is about as juicy as it gets, wow! Near perfect balance of sweet fruit and dank citrus rind bitterness. Nice dry finish with the hops hanging around just right. Very little alcohol presence. Soft full mouthfeel. Incredible brew, possibly the best IPA so far. My favorite trader hooked me up with this one, thanks bro!"
"Can. Poured super hazy orange. I had this side-by-side to regular Julius. I was impressed by how the similarities still stood tall between the two beers. Very citrusy and fruity and rindy. There were also some big contrasts. King Julius was clearly more pungent and concentrated; losing some of Julius' nuances. Still, by the nose, I should enjoy this beer similarly (Julius is one of my favorites). The flavor was huge on tropical fruit and citrus medley. Some dank character. Tangerine, melon, clementine, citrus pith. A powerful mollywhop of flavor. The body was creamy. Pretty sturdy bitterness but not an IBU baron. I really enjoyed this one; I mean Tree House does no wrong. However, I think if this beer had a moniker not directly related to their flagship, this one would not be held in quite the same regard. Pretty amazing but I'll take regular Julius any day."
This beer looks perfect poured out.. completely opaque and just bright orange color. if you smelled this not knowing you would not think its beer.. its like fresh squeezed citrus juice.. that taste is amazing... its too smooth for 8.2% you could drink these all night because it is so good and so smooth.. mouthfeel is perfect... I would not change anything about this beer except for me having more!
Pours a golden hazey Orange in the glass. Small bit of head but powerful aroma of orange. Similar to Julius but smoother. The alcohol is not noticeable at all. Really great beer. Just wish I had more than one.
"Cloud orange color, like regular julius. The nose is a citrus and mildly sweet hop. The taste follows with a lot of orange and smooth sweet bitterness. Feel is very full and enjoyable. A very good beer."
L: Cloudy golden hues with minimal lacing and thin layer of foam
"An IPA/IIPA just doesn't get much better than this. An amazingly smooth mouthfeel with no bitterness on the backend. The 'orange creamsicle' taste that they describe is just about on point. It's juicy/tropical/hoppy goodness all in one. I think this beer will ruin most other ipas for me. I didn't get as much on the nose as others, but smelled great from what I got."
"Julius on steroids. A little light on the head, but awesome aroma and very Julius-like taste. Alcohol is incredibly well-hidden. This was delicious. I regret that I only have 4 ( now 3). Awesome beer!"
"I have to echo the sentiments of the masses on this beer. This is so blatantly Julius. Drank them back-to-back and they are almost entirely similar. The one-off differences are probably the smoothness of this beer and it's slightly sweeter. Presumably due to the higher ABV and dry hopping? Regardless King Julius is a top-notch IPA through and through. My only (small) critique is that there really isn't much in this beer that's different from Julius. Maybe that's a good thing, but it makes it a little less special since Julius is so readily available at the brewery these days. Still... a must-try for any and all Tree House fans and IPA fans."
It's definitely Julius. All the juicy flavors and creamy mouthfeel are there. A little bit of bitterness creeps in at the end of each sip. I wish I had a fresh Julius to compare it to but they are honest very similar brews which is not a bad thing at all!
"Everything that's great about the delicious orange and tropical fruit flavored of Julius, only intensified with a tidal wave of extra hoppiness. A marvelous, world-class DIPA. On par with the best ive ever tasted in the category."
"Another fantastic beer from Tree House. Which isn't shocking. Its Julius on roids. Wish I got more.I was lucky enough to have a buddy give me a can. Anytime they brew this you must check it out. I enjoyed every sip,and almost cried when it was gone. Then I drank some GREEN and felt better."
L - Orange sunburst is the best way I can describe this. Held it up to the light and it lit up the opaque orange liquid. Cannot see through this beer. 
"I love Julius. Prob my fav IPA at the moment, living within 30 minutes of the brewery I had opportunity to get my hands on the super rare King Julius. "
Poured from a can into #ProperGlassware
"Tasted in Tulip glass poured from a 16 oz can. I know TH beers are intended to be had super fresh, but I tend to like the cans with a little time on them to allow the contents to acclimate to its environment - for this beer the anticipation was too great."
"Pours bright orange, hazy and opaque. Smells of sweet orange and citrus hops. Taste follows the smell. This beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful, with just enough bitter finish to make you go back for another sip, again and again. Incredible soft carbonation. A top, top beer."
Doing a side-by-side comparison with Julius. 
L: super hazy/turbid. Looks like a glass of OJ. Nice orange glow with a solid white head
Plain and simple. This stuff is phenomenal
"picked up some treehouse after work. appearance is hazy orange 2 finger size head that dissipates quickly. aroma is heavy on orange and some mango. Taste follows the nose, explosion of orange with some mango and other tropical fruits but orange dominates the mouth. incredible beer but the domination of orange is what holds it back from the likes of double sunshine and other top IPA's imo."
"Poured this one in a snifter side-by-side with regular Julius. I know they aren't the same, but I wanted the comparison. The best way I can describe the difference is that the King is loaded with flavor and aroma. So if you have had Julius, try to imagine that (one of which that is already aromatic and flavorful) amped to the next level. Upon cracking open the can, I immediately was bombarded with tropical notes. The flavor is complex, but melon is the dominant feature. An awesome beer that only comes out a few times a year, this is worthy of trading for."
It looks nothing like the last version. Looks like a murkier Julius. Tastes like a triple dry hopped Julius with a little alcohol bite. Super juicy.
"Smells of citrus orange danky goodness. Looks as such. It pours juicy, thick and cloudy. Mouthfeel is excellent with light body. It's incredibly smooth for DIPA. Be careful drinking this one."
"long wait for the elusive King. Same look and feel as Julius, smell is slightly hoppier with a citra sting, and the taste is marvelous. Tangerines, mixed with a pineapple follow up. The alcohol hits the back fo the throat just as the pineapple washes it away. Delicious"
Growler was old but I could still get a sense of what it would be like. Prefer normal Julius.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
"Tried once...then a 2nd...now a third. With out a doubt this is a great dbl ipa. I would take jr over this in a heart beat. However, this brew creeps on you more."
"Very happy to have gotten a chance to try this, but I have to say I think I prefer standard Julius by a hair."
Fresh growler poured into Pilsner glass.
"This might have been the most disappointing beer I have had to date from Tree House, since in my mind I was imagining a DIPA that would equate to an even better version of Julius. "
"From notes, drank it yesterday. 750ml bottle about 8 days olds."
I have been fortunate enough to have King Julius on a couple of occasions in growlers and cans. This happens to be my favorite beer that I have had to date.
On tap at dive bar. Killer DIPA.
"Really incredible, and really a 5. I can find no fault!"
"Picked up on 4/25, tasted on 4/3"
AMAZEBALLS! AMAZEBALLS! AMAZEBALLS! Did I say AMAZEBALLS? More cinnamon than I had anticipated...
750ml bottle poured into a globe.
750 mL growler from brewery. Amazing.
"What can I say? This beer is phenomenal, a boosted version of Julius. You can smell from the glass a distance away. Cloudy Golden orange color. Smells like fresh citrusy hops bursting out with a matching taste. Perfect smooth mouth feel allows for easy drinkability. All Hail King Julius"
"This beer sets the bar for DIPAs. This is what to expect from the future. L- cloudy, hazy orange, seemingly similar to the pithy dankness of orange juice. S- the smell of oranges, orange dreamsicle and rind over take the nose like whirlwind and bit with overbearing fruitness. Citrus. Juice. Orange. And maybe a hint of mango. T- i've had orange juice that was boozier than this. Crushing the game with pure orange. Juice citrus. As if i had just freshly squeezed orange juice. This beer kills me. F- as usually, Tree Houses signature pillowy mouthfeel overwhelms and gives you a full blown mouth orgasm. True to beer beer form. If there was a better beer, please lead me the way. Otherwise, shut up and let me enjoy this perfect brew."
Beaten by JLindros. Been a loooong time for that. Seeing his review I am even more excited to try this beer. 
"Pours into my Hill farmstead stem tulip with a nice creamy but lighter head that hits about 1/2 finger, with some decent sticky lacing... as you mentioned Nate, the lacing on the glass right off the tap was much nicer, but that doesn't stop the awesomness of the beer itself from shining through. Speaking of shining, the beer is not shiny at all, a murky hazy tangerine slightly coppery colored beer."
This was superb; it's a delicious step above regular King Julius without being silly or over the top.
Probably the best hoppy beer they have brewed.
"Brewed for 4th anniversary, reviewed 7/4/16."
This thing punches you in the mouth with an overload of hops. I thought it couldn't get any hoppier than regular King Julius. I was wrong. These will be the best burps you will ever taste. Just a clinic in how to load a beer up on hops properly. Thanks for the growler Elliott!
My favorite along side of Very Hazy and Green.
Drank 08-06-16. Oh shizzzz.
"This is an old rating from june, had an amazing mouthfeel with a juice explosion. Probably the best Dipa I've had from tree house, very green may be close"
"An insane blast of dank resinous pine, juicy orange, citrus rinds, and a huge huge presence of melon. Candied fruits arise from an already super-saturated olfactory profile, joined by more resiny dank goodness. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"
L: Super hazy - looks like a dark colored orange juice
Great beer but the hops kicked the juiciness down a tad and made it slightly more abrasive on the back end.
Poured a golden-orange haze from the can and it looked fantastic. The nose was wonderful with just a bounty of citrus flowing from it. Oranges really stand out to me. The body was just like orange juice beer. It tastes so juicy and refreshing and sweet with a light bitterness at the end. But it is very close to Julius. So close that it's not the worth giving up an arm and a leg for when Julius is easier to get.
Triple J King doesn't disappoint.
"Excellent beer (Thanks Bob, for sharing). I don't like it as much as King Julius but that is hardly criticism. Had the chance to enjoy this a few weeks ago on Skaneatles lake after a good day of golf. Tree House is amazing"
Simply the best IPA I've ever had! Citrus and dank for days.
I would not change a thing about this beer. I love everything about it.. It looks perfect.. smells like amazing oranges and tropical fruits... its mouthfeel is epc... a top 5 hoppy beer ever for me...
"Canned on 6/24/16 and served in my TH tulip. Pours a cloudy, dull orange, with a tight, creamy, 1.5 inch, off-white head. Incredible nose - bug juicy notes upfront followed by a hint of pith. Taste follows nose with the addition of a kiss of biscuit malt to break up the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation. Texture is smooth and creamy. I haven’t had Julius in a while, but this seems quite akin."
Can dated 06/24/16.
"The best beer I've ever had, period. Was lucky enough to be there when it was released. Looks great, smells like a citrus floral bomb, hop taste with no bitterness. Had it when it first came out, then had my last can 2 months later and it was nearly as good. Hope it gets made again someday."
"16 oz. can. I am aware that this a bit old at this point. Pours a very hazy orange. Smells of orange and tropical hops. Strong sweet pale maltiness. A bit of booze. Tastes just a little bit one-note, but that one note is really nice. Mostly mango, melon, and peach. Pushes more towards citrus as the slightest bit of bitterness builds. Seems like it will become sweet, but never does. Malty nonetheless. Medium heavy. I started drinking this thinking it wasn't great, probably because it isn't fresh, but this drinks really nicely. Maybe it doesn't pop the way it used to, but it's still exceptional."
"I missed out on this one at first, but was lucky enough to land one in a trade, and it did not disappoint. Classic Treehouse haze, bold hop and citrus aroma, all to be expected. The taste begins pure citrus, hop juice before turning just slightly piny and finishing with a slight malt crispness. The feel, however is phenomenal. Pillowy just as Julius is described, but also a little chewy and a smooth as butter finish. I hope to see this one again soon."
Growler fill date: July 1 2016 - Todays Date July 29 2016
"Consumed 7/23 on the beach in Aptos, CA. The aroma is great, similar to the base Julius. The mouthfeel for me is what sets this apart, just silky smooth. Taste is great, big juicy notes of citrus and tropical fruit. World class, so grateful a friend gave one to me."
Everything I could ever want from this style of IPA. Perfect hazy look. Amazing smell of a tropical fruit basket on the nose. Mouthfeel and taste exactly what you want out of a NE style IPA. I can't think of a better NE style IPA.
"King-Triple-Jay-bird doesn't disappoint, this guy is well worth the quest to find some. Starting off with a Julius base is always a great Idea. Adding extra punch with raising the ABV and hopping the hell of out it some more makes this beer a real Frankenstein's monster. The flavors are Juicy, hoppy, and absolutely in your face. The differences between the regular Julius and even the regular Triple Jay may seem subtle at first, but they quickly become apparent after a few sips. Tree House once again hits it out of the park."
"Of course it's fantastic, but I recall being more impressed with the regular King Julius. I'm sure they're pretty close (how many more of these Julius variants can they really do anyway??), but at least in my mind this is going to fall just short of being Tree House's best hops."
"Although I may be a bit biased, this beer didn't disappoint, aside from the fact that it likely won't be brewed again anytime soon, if ever. Though the difference between this and ""regular"" King J may be neglible, it's meets the hype. Extremely creamy and juicy, it's everything you'd hope to find in a NE DIPA ."
"5 out of 5! DEEP orange color with a dark white thick and tasty foam head. Blast of orange and tropical fruit on the nose, and strong orange-juice grapefruit citrus flavor. Thick mouth feel loaded with hops, and hop oils, and thickness. This beer is a true NE juice / orange-juice bomb! Over the top intense. Hope Tree house makes it again!"
"Can't write a fancy enough, feel good connoisseur review to do this beer justice. Have enjoyed all of the top beers. This beer smashes all of the others."
"The perfect expression of my favorite IPA. Really one of the only Tree House IIPAs that I prefer to it's IPA counterpart. Everything is amped up from the base, but abv is well-hidden and so damn juicy!"
3 weeks old can.
"Had this a few nights ago. Taste was smooth, little bit of booze at the end. Very crisp, great smell and taste. I wish I had more and wish I could compare it to King Julius. But going off memory I still want and like King Julius the most."
"Classic Tree House hazy orange. A glorious nose with a medley of citrus, mango, peach and pineapple. Absolutely mouth filling with a soft fruity mouthfeel and a balanced bitterness throughout. The flavor stays on the finish for a good 45 seconds after you swallow. Thoroughly carbonated with little tiny refreshing bubbles. This beer may have ruined me. I may not be able to enjoy anything else again."
"Excellent, but doesn't stand out from the pack of Tree House IPAs. Noticeably better than a month-old Julius, but definitely glad I didn't pay the absurd secondary market value for it."
So this is some great beer....but it isnt as much of a juicy hop bomb as the original King Julius....Still a solid beer but not as great as I had expected from the reviews
This beer is straight fire! The dry hopping really makes it drier and less juicy that regular Julius. Beer was great on the nose and it was crushable.
"Popped this bottle at an epic Omaha, Nebraska bottle share. Poured into a teku. Had this side by side with JJJuliusss... I preferred JJJuliusss. Still an absolutely fantastic beer. Keep up the good work Tree House. You magical innovators! I highly recommend this."
"Had super high expectations for King Julius and was a bit disappointed. King Jjjulius, however, is a great beer. The dry hopping adds a nice extra punch of flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel is substantial and perfect. Had with regular Julius, which is still the king of all these iterations. 1) Julius 2) King Jjjulius 3) Jjjulius 4) King Julius"
"Wow, expectations were high and this knocked it out of the park. Way better than Julius, much better than King Julius, and Ive never had Jjjulliusss, but this one tops the list as far as Julius variations go. This is getting into Green, Very Hazy and dare I say Juice Machine territory."
"Mad props to Lunchboxhead for a package that also included a Dinner and TH Bright w/Nelson. Popped the can and was blown away a wave of tropical nose, especially ripe mango. Nose never quits -- you can keep going back well after the pour. Gorgeous unfiltered dull orange color, slight head, a little more carbonation than I am used to seeing in other TH DIPAs and IPAs. Taste - grapefruit, passion fruit, pineapple, some grapefruit pith at the end leaves a little bitter bite, but doesn't linger too long. While there are a number of breweries like Aslin down here that are coming real close in the juice bomb race, it is that killer smooth mouth feel that seems to keep TH on top -- and this one is no exception. Can't imagine what this was like the week of release. Overall, this is more of the same TH with some variation from the Haze, Julius, Alter family -- in this case perhaps taking it to a new level (or maybe I was just in the mood today). Unbelievable."
"Wow, this beer is amazing. First Tree House beer that I've had and I will definitely be looking for more. One of the best DIPA's that I have had. so juicy and refreshing."
"Pours an extremely hazy dark orange color. Looks like OJ coming out of the can. Medium white head that actually hangs on for a little while throughout drinking. Good sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is orange, orange and more orange. Sticky tropical hops come through as well. Taste reflects much of the same - like an orange creamsicle with some slight booze. Extremely smooth beer. Another knockout from these guys, tough to beat what they are doing these days."
"Orange juice with foam. Super juice looking. Blood spatter lacing. One of, if not the, best smelling beer I've ever smelled. If I had to drown, I'd want it to be from breathing this. Give me the scented candle. The taste is phenomenal. Super juicy and yet has a very balanced bitter. Such a great job. Great mouthfeel but not as creamy as a few of their other offerings. Hot damn, what a beer."
"I liked this beer, hell I rated it pretty highly, but I do not understand why everyone thinks every Tree House beer is perfect. I have had at least 10-15 different offerings from them. Are they all good? Yes, mostly very good in fact. Are any my favorite beers of all time? Well no, not sure I even have one in my top 5. I am not sure if guys who get Tree House want to perpetuate the ridiculous trade market by giving all high ratings or what is going on, but this beer especially was disappointing based on the hype. Look at all the perfect ratings, I expected omnipresent supergalactic oneness to be attained at first sip, but in the end I am not sure if I even like it better than Julius. Very good, yes. Perfect, no."
"Poured from a can and was thick, syrupy, amber in color with a nice white head. Nice white lacing and a white collar that lasted till the end. Tropical fruit, melon, cut grass and lots of pine in both aroma and taste. Thick mouthfeel with a long bitter, sweet finish."
"So juicy! Immense amounts of citrus of all kinds immediately after we popped the growler. Extremely opaque and looks like chicken noodle soup broth in the glass. The taste is incredible; so much orange, mango, lemon, grapefruit. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had."
"I don't give many ""all 5's"" these days (maybe I'm a snob now?) but this beer was absolutely perfect in every way TO ME."
"About as perfect as perfect can get. The smell, fresh hops and cut grass, hints of tropical fruit. Taste was a bit bigger bodied than I thought, no booziness, just an explosion of juicy hops, tropical fruit and pine. What a great beer."
Orange yellow sunset. Haze bomb. White head. Lace.
"Can pour; Looks like liquid meal - not orange like Julius. Nose of citrus and slight grapefruit. Mouthfeel is actually almost chewy, beyond pulpy to another level. Flavors are never over the top juice, but all the juicy flavors are there. Finish is faintly bitter. Amazing."
"Consumed fresh from a can, poured into a tulip glass."
"Poured from a can into a teku. Beautiful hazy color, huge tropical fruit nose and orange juice consistency. The best DIPA I've tasted, are perhaps a top five beer, overall."
"The long awaited review of the one and only, King JJJuliusss."
Fresh can drank on 7/2/2016
Consumed both from 2L Growler and 16oz can purchased from TH brewery on 6/24/2016
"The beer comes in a turbid, super hazy light to medium gold."
"Not sure what to put here....it's perfect? Deep rich orange haze, hoppy orange cream sickle. Perfectly smooth, hits all the right notes and then some..."
I'm sitting here trying to find words. I don't think this is beer. I think someone just took oranges and passion fruits and blended them up. I also get notes of a creamsicle. There is no way hoppy beers can get any better. Or many beers for that matter.
"Appearance- gorgeous beer. Light orange, hazy with great lacing and minimal head"
I honestly don't know how they do it any more. Just a perfect beer. The citrus and juiciness of julius and jjjuliusss but an incredibly smooth finish. A soft creamy mouth feel and light enough that its hard to believe its over 8%
"So pumped to try this beer. Been a treehouse fanatic since they had only 2-3 beers in rotation. Purchased 7/1/16. A surprise release left over from the 4th anniversary bash. Shared with fellow hopheads 2 hours after purchase. Sadly the taste was of cheap canned grapefruit juice. Intensely acidic, lacked the TH mouthful and super hot burning alcohol. Can only be described as cheap grapefruit juice and rot gut vodka consumed in our college days. We were shocked but still love TH."
"This is not Treehouse hype. This is a beer that is worthy of 5's across the board and all the praise that it is given. Smooth, balanced, citrusy, and a little boozy. I was fortunate enough to end up with a can and wish I could have shared it with all of the people who don't believe Treehouse is as good as the ratings say. Hopefully these types of beers become somewhat more regular with the new brewery but who knows. 5!!!"
"16oz can, purchased from Treehouse on 6.29.16, enjoyed on 7.1.16, poured into a Treehouse Teku glass. Reviewed from tasting journal."
"This absolutely lived up to the hype for me. Take King Julius, an add the additional complexity of spicy earth and dank, green vegetation and you'll have KJJJ. Appearance and smell is identical to King Julius: murky, hazy burnt orange with a considerably thick head. Mouthfeel is quite full and thick as well, but the pop of bitterness from the middle of the mouth to the end make it less rounded than the original KJ or a beer like Doppelganger. Ridiculously good beer though, and very possibly the best in the style I've yet to have."
Canned on 6/24/16 for the Tree House 4th anniversary; I feel very blessed to have received one unexpected can a few days ago at the brewery; this 8.4% DIPA has almost zero alcohol taste; another amazing beer by TH
I rated this a smidge lower than jjjuliusss. I probably should have let this one warm up a tad before drinking it. I don't think the complexity had a chance to make its way out. Amazing nonetheless!
16oz. can into Tree House stemware. 
"Thick orange juice pour with a bubbly head. Bright citrus nose with tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit. Grapefruit shines in the flavor with only a hint of bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. Balanced."
"This really is just like an orange juice bomb. I have never seen any beer look so much like juice. With respect to taste, it is a bit more herbaceous than Julius, tons of citrus and melon. Superb beer."
"super duper thanks to rob, mark, dave, and Messi for that solid afternoon mini share and fresh growler of this juice. so much hype around this one. athough really good, my exlectations were a bit high on this and I found it a hair boozy, to be expected? really solid though, it even looked like OJ."
Picked up some cans of this at the brewery. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
"On draft at the anniversary party. The look smell and feel of this beer were over the top. In my opinion they took the best of their IPAs and combined it. The haziness was on point, the smell was fantastic, an absolute juice bomb and the mouthfeel on this was incredible. Tied with a batch of cadence for the best mouthfeel I have ever had in a beer. The only thing is the taste was a bit all over the place with the hop profile. An absolute treat even if the flavour wasn't what I was expecting, and I'm looking forward to opening later to see if the flavor improves with a little bit of age."
"L - first things first: awesome can label. One of Tree House's most inspired and artistic yet. This one looks downright serious. Pours a vicious, stupidly deep dark ripe orange. If you thought JJJULIUSSS was a solid brick of color that couldn't get any more... solid, you're in for a heck of a surprise. Pure OJ with a soft, creamy head. Fine-particles and sticky as can be. I can practically see the hops. "
cant believe this is even a beer. my god! all hail King JJJuliusss
"Julius squared. Unbelievable aroma, so hoppy on the tongue it tingles, taste is over the top citrus, best beer by TH so far!"
L: Dark orange and hazy
"With gratitude to a glorious Facebook soul who posted a picture of the Tree House covered window which meant they were bottling unicorn tears, I ran out of the office for the 2hr drive. "
Canned 6/24/16 poured into an TH Tulip 
Poured from a can on the same day as it was canned (6/24/16)
Tap at anniversary party
Wow!
"The King is back and better than ever. Pours as you would expect a TH to, good hazy orange color. Huge nose after the pour, lots of fruit. The classic juicy Julius taste is here with a touch of added complexity. It drinks so smoothly that you do not begin to notice the 8.4%. One of the best I have ever had, hopefully it gets brewed again soon."
"Everything Julius is....on steroids! Powerful upfront Julius flavor and scent, soft decadent feel, hardly a bite of alcohol, then BAM.....that 8.4 creeps up on you fast! Probably because I pounded the snot out of it. It's really good. Good luck acquiring!"
Tropical Cream Sex with Alcohol. Dont see anything ever topping the True King!
Great offering from Treehouse. Managed to grab six cans today at $5 each. Well worth the money. 
It is very good beer
"Pure hop juice right here. There's ethanol on the finish that's a bit of a let down, but yum everywhere else."
Call me crazy - but my first experience with Very Hazy was not a particularly overwhelming one.
From can after having a Hazy can. 
"In the glass, it's that beautiful Treehouse orange. Not too dark, and not too light, but definitely hazy and dense. Smell is sweet, creamy, and peachy, with ripe mango, and a little bit of citrus. Beautiful mouthfeel, dare I say, perfectly carbonated, with a lovely, smooth finish. They've got the fluffy juiciness really dialed in. Taste is fruit and magic but by no means too sweet. As with most Treehouse brews, the sweetness sneaks off-stage at some point during your sip, and everything ends on a very balanced note. An amazing beer."
Treehouse can do no wrong!
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head that recedes quickly. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of peach, grape, blueberry, and candy. It tastes of peach, grape, blueberry, and candy. It has a medium body. An excellent IPA from Tree House, one of the best."
16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. Shared by schen9303. 
"Poured from can dated 4-13-18 on 5/6/18. Pour an opaque darker yellow with small white head. Real strong citrus noes on the aroma, that burst into my nostrils even upon the opening of the can. Very smooth and creamy on the palate, with very little bitterness to speak of. I've had quite a bit of Tree House, and this can really brought me back to my first experience with the brewery. Well done!"
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA"
"Fully opaque dark tan, verging into brown territory, with a large, dense and lumpy beige foam that is slow to settle. Having this side by side with regular Haze, the head is less active and tall, but of similar hue, and Haze's body is a bit lighter, but still in the tan to yellow area."
"Incrementally better than haze, very drinkable, and not a novelty as some of these amped up beers can be. Definately prefer it to haze and would drink regularly if available."
"Amazing, but only slightly better than reg Haze for me. Wouldn’t go crazy seeking it out unless it was at like 1/2 case allotments. Otherwise, regular haze @ regular 1 case allotments would do the trick. Not bashing this, it’s great, but wasn’t leaps and bounds better like I thought it might be."
Pure cantaloupe. Amazing beer. One of the best tree house.
"No a fan, drain poured after a few sips"
tasted like rotten fruit
Best beer I’ve ever had! I consider this to be a perfect beer! You want to savor it but it tastes amazing! Always hoping for another release of this!
"A very familiar flavor from the Tree House family. Did not get anything particularly different from the normal Haze flavor/mouthfeel profile. A great beer as always, but nothing I would desperately seek out again."
delicious!
Tree House 4th Anniversary
Anything less than a perfect 5 is an insult in my top 5 all time... this beer is what it’s all about
"I couldn’t believe people waited in line for Beer from Tree House Brewing, and then I had a delicious glass of Very Hazy. I will soon be waiting in line for my own assortment that will hopefully include some Very Hazy!"
"One of my favorite TH beers, only got lucky once to get it fresh. As outstanding as it was it is hard to improve on Haze. Stupid drinkable 8.6 what?"
Best beer I've ever had. Period.
"Acquired in trade, less than10 days old and shared with 4 other people as part of an IPA tasting."
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with thick white head. Aroma is tropical fruits with some grapefruit. Extremely well balanced. Excellent tasting that goes down way too easy. Huge tropical fruit flavor with mango, papaya, pineapple and also some tangerine. Incredible imperial IPA."
Fantastic
All around amazing. One of the best in the world imo. Perfect balance of bitterness and flavor.
"This is the king of NE IPAs in my opinion. Hazy, light orange appearance and bursting with fruit flavor. I get grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit, and tangerines. Nice mix of citrus and tropical. Full mouth feel, and just the right balance of sweet and bitter. This is worth trading for."
For the hype...meh
Just another outstanding beer from Treehouse. Full of citrus - juicy goodness. Smooth and easy to drink - no boozyness at all. Bursting with flavor. Not easy to get but worth the effort.
Holy shit!!!!
Reviewed on 4/10/17
"Without question, one of the best beers I've ever had. Full smooth mouthfeel beyond compare; pours beautifully within a very hazy orange spectrum and mellows nicely after opening; a perfect mix of sweet fruits and bitterness that kept me coming back for more. Limited offerings make this a fanatical must have. The DIPA world has met its match !"
Thank you to Drew for making the dream of VH a reality! Incredible stonefruit profile with beautiful resinous nose and decadent mouthfeel. Phenomenal.
"What more could I possibly add to make people know that this beer is a must try/bucket list beer? Pours, well, hazy. Smells like something you should be enjoying on a tropical beach. As far the taste, you already know it's as close to perfect as you can get. Typical soft and juicy mouth feel that you'd expect from Tree House. "
Canned 3/23/17; drank 4/3/17 @ the Yarchives. 
Favorite Tree House to date.
Most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. cloudy and citrusy hops like swish but the drinkability of ALL Day IPA. This is ridiculously good. Hides the heat better than any beer I've ever had
Canned a week and a half ago. Tulip glass.
"This is absolutely excellent. It holds all of the characteristics that make Tree House great. This is hazy, super aromatic, love that bubblegum taste from TH, flavorful, packs a punch without overpowering. Delicious!"
"I feel blessed that there were surprise cans (two) at the end of the line to go with the daily offering. Pours thick into a deep, cloudy orange, with almost a little grey to it – like orange fog. The head dies down quickly leaving tight lacing along the sides. Very small bubbles of carbonation. Solid hop foundation with layers of subtle top notes – they reveal themselves as they moves around my tongue. Mango and orange highs, with some notes of grass, hay, and earth, with some rising bread dough mixed in – yet none of these flavors dominates. So soft and smooth – even with the higher abv there's only a little alcohol bite. This one really makes me slow down and savor it as it deserves."
"Treehouse V Hazy, thanks for the share Josh."
Canned 3/23/17.
A 16 oz can poured into a Tree House teku. The date was smudged but it looks like 3-23-17. 
"This is treehouse's best beer. The look of this beer was like straight up peach/orange juice. Smell was of peaches,mango, pineapple. The taste and mouthfeel were exceptional. It's like drinking a thick pillowy cloud of peaches, oranges, mango, pineapple. This improves an already great beer in Haze. Amazing"
I like regular Haze but it isn't amongst my favorite TH beers so I didn't expect this version to completely blow my mind. But it did. 
"Poured into a TH tulip at BTs Smokehouse about 15 minutes after picking up at the brewery. Very Hazy is aptly named, about a finger and a half of big bubbles in the head and beautiful lacing. Aside from the bubbles, looks like orange juice in the glass. Smells like tropical fruit and citrus....quite strongly. Tastes incredible, very hop forward citrusy and tropical. Its balanced with a slight biterness on the back end, no alcohol tasted in this at all....very dangerous at 8.6%, and I mean that in the best way possible. Another wonderful offering from the best brewery I've had the pleasure of visiting."
"I like haze. Its one of the better treehouse beers. I expected to LOVE this beer but came away thinking it was kind of meh. It has a peachy nose and some peach/ pasonfruit vibes but doesn't do it for me. It also doesn't feel as creamy as it should. Flavour isn't there. Honestly, I'd skip this one."
This beer made me fall in love with Treehouse. It ruined any beer that wasn't Treehouse to just be ehh.
"Look: orange sherbert, 1inch creamy white head... light orangish yellow, really gorgeous "
"hazy as it is named. Mango, pineapple, glorious fruit bomb with the distinguished soft fluffy feel of all TH brews. Glass lacing from top to bottom. These people nail it every time. Great job again Nate"
"Canned 02-18-16. Drank 02-20-16. Juicy, creamy & wonderful. No sign of abv. Fantastic IIPA."
Favorite double IPA in the world
"This is the best beer I've ever had. Absolute perfection. Since we're all incredible beer snobs now, we can still find something to nitpick about a a King Julius or a Very Green, but not this one. It is simply perfect. Mango, pineapple, Guava, dank, turbidity, pillowy, hazy, whatever. Incredible."
The best of Tree House's offerings. Even after about 6 weeks it was better than anytjing else fresh.
Can poured into tulip.
"A: Full yellow haze, white head."
"This might just be the greatest beer that Tree House has ever had and that I have every tasted. This beer is perfectly named with a truly opaque murkiness. Incredible head/lacing, a bouquet tropical aromatics that smells like fresh blended juices. I get a lot of guava, papaya, passionfruit, and pineapple. There is a ever so slight hop/bitterness note towards the end that sparks and sizzles. There are so many layers of complexity that it is rather difficult to capture solely with words. Drink fresh. Cheers to the many blessings Tree House has bestowed upon me."
What can I say - Its Tree House for god sake.
"Very hazy (hurr), very little head. Fresh, tropical smell. Feels thick, almost. Almost no alcohol taste (some at the end), sweet fruits, mostly tropical pineapple and mango, slightly resinous."
Huge thank you to Mark for sharing this treat.
Poured from a 16oz can dated 6-20-16
"I love Haze and Very Hazy just pushes the limit on everything wonderful about it. Awesome strong peach nose, classic Tree House mouth feel, and no sense of the alcohol for an 8+% beer. Wonderful"
750 ml swing top poured into rocks glass.
"Absolutely incredible. No booze presence. Beautiful combination of grapefruit and tropical notes. Mouthfeel is perfect. Not too sweet, soft carbonation. Great juicy aroma. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had"
"Easily the best beer from TreeHouse. Its just delicious, every time i drink this beer, i cant wait for the next sip of hoppy sweetness bitter creamy goodness."
"OK, so I am a big time Tree House fan boy even if I have to cross the Madon-Dixon and can only get their wares a few times a year. This is another epic offering. Unfiltered , cloudy; huge tropical nose that doesn't disappear. Flavors - this one has an incredible balanced mix of tropical flavors and grapefruit bitterness. And of course, the super soft Tree House mouthfeel brings it home. Perfect carbonation. Ever so slight hint of the 8.6 at the very end, but hardly noticeable. Mad props again to lunchboxhead for his more than generous trade that included this gem. In my opinion this one stands among the very best of the TH giants. If buying into the Monson hype is wrong, then I don't want to be right."
"Another excellent one from TH. Hazy, murky tan-yellow color. Booming juice on the palate, however, it was a bit more bitter and astringent than I would have liked. Prefer plain ole' TH Haze."
Canned 8/19/16. Consumed 8/26/16.
"Pours super hazy, bright orange-yellow in color, with one inch head. Even by Tree House's high standards, this looks amazing. Taste is sweet peach, nectarine, and orange. Like regular Haze, my previous favorite Tree House brew, but with extra fruit flavor. Heavy bodied, thick, slight bitterness and lots of goodness. May be my favorite Tree House brew. Well worth driving out for. Only my third perfect beer in 2,500 ratings. Cannot see how an imperial IPA can taste any better, but am willing to search for that brew."
Canned and enjoyed on 19Aug 2016
This poured out as a hazy golden color with a thick white head on top. The smell is loaded with hoppy aromas. The taste is balanced between the sweet malt and some big powerful hops. Overall this beer is very good.
"Not the pineapple/guava type flavor as their flagship beer, but way better. It has tropical notes, but a nice malt and bitterness to balance it out. If you get a chance to try it, do so. Tulip glass, and not fridge temps."
"Perfect Very Hazy look, no doubt, it's glorious. Small is on point, doesn't pop to perfection but it smells soft and mellow, tons of tropics and onion.... bring it on i love where this stands so far... Taste is fucking insane I swear to god that they added sugared grapefruit extract to this. This might be... i can't say it... i won't but its one of the very best from treehouse, they perfected the mouthfeel for 8.6% there is virtually no alcohol presence at all, it is incredible. Sharp and quick (?) finish, this beer is special and I am forever envious of anyone that lives near this brewery."
Consumed from the can. Reviewed from notes.
The beer comes in a medium gold hazy color.
"Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse snifter. Thank you Patrick for hooking me up with this, been seeking a can out for a while. "
"No one is doing hoppy beers like Treehouse at the moment and this is just more proof. I tend to prefer the regular iterations of these beers to their ""double"" or ""very"" cousins, but this one came closest to the original for me."
Amped up haze. My second favorite tree house ipa behind very green. Amazing beer
Amazing complexity and depth yet so crushable. Unreal beer.
"Wow! What a phenomenal beer. This is worth a wait in line, worth trading for, worth seeking out! I have nothing more to say. I'm going to savor the rest of this 750. Wow!"
6/2/16 can drank in my lovely Tree House chalice
"Creamy, fruity, nice hop balance. One of the best beers I've ever had"
"This is almost perfect for me. Words can't describe how good this beer truly is. For an 8.6% this beer is dangerously drinkable. The crazy part is I wasn't a real big Haze guy to begin with because of the first batches that, let's be honest here, were bad batches but once they got it right ... my god is any Haze growing on me."
"Takes Haze, an amazing DIPA and make it perhaps the best beer I've ever had. Very Green may be the only beer that comes close to competing in terms of all facets of beer. Simply an incredible beer with all the right flavors, mouthfeel, smell and look. Another exceptional beer perfected by Treehouse."
Poured from a can dated 6/2/16.
"Can dated 6/2, it is only hours old! This beer pours a completely opaque golden orange identical to orange juice. The head is slow to form but ends up being huge, dense and bright white. Retention is excellent and there are webs of lacing down the entire glass. Smell is amazing. Easily the best smelling beer I have ever encountered, if I could rate it a 6 I would. Orange, peach, pineapple, grapefruit, and dank citrus pith explode out of the glass. No joke you can smell it from across the room. Taste is the same with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Feel is amazing, cannot believe this is 8.6%. It is so soft, smooth, and sticky with a little prickle from the bitterness on the finish. Overall what can I say? Only beer I have ever rated a perfect 5. There is literally nothing that could be done to improve this beer. Perfection in a can."
"Pineapple, mango, dank bomb. Lucky to get my hands on one of these in trade at the last Swish release. Bomb!"
"A: Very Hazy (haha) golden straw...really, you can't see through the beer at all. Copious head with super fine carbonation."
Just wow!
Look - That signature TH/New England look. Haze for days. Looks like juice in the glass. Beautiful. 
"16 oz can poured into a Tree House teku. Pours a light peach color with hazy body (ironic, I know). Minimal white head and lots of lacing. The aromas are mind-blowing. The only other beer that has shocked me this much was Juice Machine... aromas of tropical fruits dancing around. The flavors definitely follow suit with peaches, pineapple, tangerines, and other tropical citrus fruits. There is a little bit of dank and minimal malt; the ABV is well hidden with this one! The carbonation is on point and mouthfeel is very creamy. Overall, this is an absolutely phenomenal DIPA from the aromas, to the tastes, to the mouthfeel, to the color, and so on... this is worth seeking out! Super drinkable beer! Cheers!"
Creamy mouthfeel compared to regular Haze
16oz can served in a snifter glass.
One of the top beers(if not the top) that I've ever tasted. Fantastic nose and soft citrus grapefruit taste. Can't taste the 8.6% at all. Only wish they were closer. Exceptional!!!
"Another delicious tropical fruit offering. Really hard pressed to say if it's any better than Haze. It's thicker, a tad more bitter. Beautiful color. I'll be back."
"If they don't have this in heaven, then I don't wanna go. This is perfection in a can."
"It's great, but I prefer regular Haze. This is still better than 99% of other Imperial IPAs, but it is just not as drinkable as it's baby brother, in my opinion."
"Pours from can into a tulip. Golden, opaque, with a hint of orange. White foam that dissipates quickly."
"Have had this many time, and definitely prefer regular Haze. It's a bit overdone. Too heavy and flabby, but still very tasty. Haze is focused and elegant. This beer is a bit sloppy..."
"L: Yellow orange in color, opaque. Paler and not as bright as other TH beers. Nice bright white head that sinks down to a thin film. "
Fresh growler shipped to Nebraska out of a snifter.
Poured from a growler at a share. Super murky and orange. Could smell this the second the growler got popped open. Dankness and tropical fruits came rushing to my nose. Taste is the same...dankness with tropical fruit. Super creamy. This one lingers a bit. Might be my favorite Tree House beer.
Great all around beer from TH. Gets better once it warms up a bit. Hops open up more and mouthfeel gets better with time
Canned on 10/14/16. Enjoyed my last one on 2/12/17. 
Purchased and canned on 4-15.
Nice dank juice bomb. Very creamy with a nice smooth finish. Pours yellowish orange. Becomes more juicy as the time passes. The beer burps are top notch with this one.
"Not the biggest Haze fan, but these pumped up versions from Tree House are always amazing. This is beyond dank. I was searching for chunks of hops in the glass. Hops to the point of murdering you palate, it a good way! KJ and VG are better, but still awesome!"
"The only fault Very Hazy has going for it is that it's put out by the same brewery that make King Julius; so despite it's amazingness, it can't even be given credit as the best DIPA the brewery makes. Outstanding nose of course, and that color...so beautiful. As mentioned, it's not quite KJ, but it rises above its brothers Very Green and Doppelganger."
"Best TH beer I've had, and the best DIPA I've had."
"Definitely a five for me. This beer tasted better 3 weeks old than the day I got it. It tasted very fresh, awesome taste, smelled great, went down sooo smooth, might be better than King Julius. This was awesome"
Love those flip top growlers! Filled Feb 18 and was still drinking pretty amazing 5 weeks later! Tons of Juicy hops as you would expect...can't imagine what it tastes like 5 weeks ago!!
"Pours out the typical haze for daze orange. Smell is very unique; peaches, mango, and apricots. The taste follows suit with the typical th mouthfeel. A step up from regular haze. This is actually pretty different because it has a somewhat dry aftertaste. And the fruits are lighter fruits like apricots and peaches and maybe some mango. Amazing again"
"I've had many TH lately, and this one may be my favorite of all. Perfect flavor, well balanced, juicy, but not overdone. Certainly worth a trip when this is being poured or canned."
White head with lace. Super hazy golden yellow.
Look: yellow grapefruit juice. Completely opaque with a nice finger to two finger head of tiny bubbles.
"Pours cloudy orange, hazy with a two finger head. Smells of dankness and citrus, peppery hops. Taste is a quick bready malt into a tropical smooth beer. That sweet citrus really blasts in. Bitter on the back, but smooth and delicious. Wow... this beer did not disappoint."
"Poured from a can into a teku. Essentially a more concentrated Haze - huge, juicy beer with an unbeatable mouthfeel. Although I prefer Green to Haze, Very Hazy exceeded Very Green IMO. A well executed DIPA."
"Haze just got enhanced with even more pungent dank hops and grapefruit juice. Beer is out of control, Haze 4 Daze!! Would love to have this on tap one day"
"Of the imperials, King Julius, Very Hazy, Very Green, and Doppelganger- this is my favorite. Absolutely well balanced as opposed to the others which were just more the ingredients, this actually felt like it took artisanship to maintain the integrity of its younger brother. Very fluffy, soft and delicate, just beautiful."
"Where to begin. If Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath were beers, and they had a drug infused three way in a college dorm....this would be the ""whoopsie"" offspring of the three titanic beasts. Epic juice/hop bomb, surpasses King Julius and Juice Machine in the ""juice"" department, and also successfully eclipses Haze, which in my opinion is one of TH's most delicious beers. Best IPA/DIPA I've had from this phenomenal brewery."
"Holy crap, I don't know how it could get much better. My favorite IPA that I've had from Treehouse. The hop aroma and flavor is very unique. Subtle pine, but oozing tropical fruits. I need more of this in my life."
UNREAL! Treehouse can do no wrong! Been sitting on this one for a week and it still tastes fresh as hell! Typicall Treehouse juicy / hazy goodness. Creamy mouth feel keeps you coming back for more. Wish these guys were closer!
pours nice thick pulpy goodness. can't see through this. nose is strong grapefruit and some orange. really nice. taste is upfront palate bitterness of orange rind followed by sine nice peach and apricot sweetness rounding out the brew. very end bitterness lingers. this beer is great but so is haze. not sure if this is an upgrade but definitely world class. ive tried all the double versions and to me doppleganger is still the best.edit: did side by side w haze. this version is almost the same but had better nose. more bitterness and slightly more flavor. very good. I originally thought haze was better but the more I drank this comes out ahead.
"Extremely hazy, grapefruit color, with an incredible juicy nose and taste. Absolutely amazing. One of the best IPA's I've ever had, hands down. Grab a can if you can find one."
This is pretty much my ideal IPA.
"Look- same color as grapefruit juice, completely opaque, pours a half finger of white, thin head that retains pretty well."
Ridiculous!! Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Perfect balance of hoppy-ness and juicy fruit flavors. Every time I take gulp I taste some additional favor and I'm left wanting more.
Pours orange hazy and looks like orange juice with a nice 1/2 inch foamy head. Smells of tropical fruits. Tastes much the same and it finishes with a nice bitter finish. Very little alcohol taste. Wonderful wonderful beer.
Had it from a growler poured fresh that day and it blew my socks off. Just had a can of it last night and it was extremely underwhelming. Gonna try it again tonight to see what's up.
"From can. Very hazy indeed. Blood spatter lacing. Thin head but keeps well. Intense citrus smell. Wide array of fruit on the taste. Juicy, sweet, and a bit of bitter peel. Good carbonation, bit of stick. Nice feel. Another great TH ipa."
"Pours a hazy golden color, thick white head that dissipate some upon drinking. Strong lacing on the glass. Smell is dank, tropical grapefruit, citrus. Tastes reflect the same, nice balance of tropical and dank. Mouthfeel is straight smooth velvet. Incredible beer"
L: Light peach colored hues and of course the requisite hazy body; minimal white head
"Very hazy yellow color. Huge nose of citrus and sweet hops. The taste follows the nose with a little bit of bitter balance. The feel is both very full an refreshing. A fantastic beer, one of tree house best."
up there with some of the best beers ever.. the color is a dark straw orange.. smell is huge citrus with some dank... the flavor is a burst of dried citrus fruit.. has come dank... closest beer to Headroom I have ever had... absolutely world class... unreal...
"Poured from the 16 oz can dated 02/18/16 (with a nice ""Haze me bro"" tag underneath), 7 days old. This beer lives up to its name and comes out opaquely hazy, orange juice colored, nice foamy head leaves beautiful lacing. Perfection!"
"Look: Very clear (just kidding, quite turbid!), little head and a tan/golden hue."
Poured from a 750 ml. Growler bottled on Thursday February 18th.
Pours that classic hazy color.
"Pours a dull gold with a murky clarity and a creamy, bright white head. Nose expresses pith and juicy citrus aromas. Taste reveals dull citrus and an earthy quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild carbonation. Overall - decent, but not my favorite TH offering."
"A: Pours the perfect ""hazy"" pale yellow color with a nice white fluffy head and lacing all the way down the glass."
L - Classic hazy (pun intended) golden orange with two fingers of white head
Great juicy beer! The orange and pineapple aromas hit me hard. The mouth feel is full with very little bitterness. A great one from our brewery of choice.
"Nearly a perfect beer! Awesome nose, appearance and flavor. Assuming you can snag some soon, this beer doesn't disappoint. One of the best that Tree House has created to date!"
"L - pure clementine juice. Floury haze with a peachy turbid murkiness. Reminds me of a lighter Green. In the right light, it looks like fresh-squeezed pink grapefruit juice. Thin, crisp head to top it all off. "
Poured from a 16 oz can. 2/18/16 canning date. Haze Me Bro!
Big thanks to Dean.
Huge thanks to Dean for hooking us up with this one. Sounds awesome. Shared with JLindros.
"As close to a “perfect” beer as I’ve ever had. The gold standard for New England IPAs, it truly lives up to its hype. Wish it was easier to get but oh well. Can’t wait to have it again."
"Deep golden color, a bit of hoppy haziness. Pours a nice white head, creamy and lingering."
"Unfiltered, drink straight out of the can, fruity aroma and juicy flavor with just the right feel to make you have to make another swig"
Can:
This beer revolutionized what a beer can be. I will never forget the smell when i first cracked a can it was unlike any beer i have ever had. I continue to think this is the gold standard for New England IPAs.
The hazy (but not cloudy) amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1 1/2” fluffy off-white head that recedes slowly but visibly until it eventually becomes a thin irregular island of foam on the surface with a ring around the glass and having left a webbing of patches and irregular streaks of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a couple of arch shaped patches of foam with some small patches and legs of lacing between the two.
Tastes much better out of the can as indicated!
nother of my favorites. Awesome beer/
"I would write a lengthy report; however, that has been done countless times. Is this the best IPA I have ever consumed? No. It is amazingly balanced with a very distinct flavor profile. I will say there was more pine in this than anticipated. Exceptional IPA but I cannot consider it the best I have had."
"I bought a can in Waterbury when we were driving north to Ottawa from Amherst in early fall. After that can had been sitting in my fridge for a couple of weeks, I finally built up the...nerve, I guess, to try it. It has a very tasty bitterness and the beer is quite rich. However, I prefer lower abv beers for a reason and this beer didn't alter that. It's boozy. I drank some ""from the can,"" as recommended, but also poured much of it into a glass. Didn't really notice any difference there."
Hard to describe the delicious complexity of this beer. Perfectly balanced hop profile that renders one speechless. The taste is so unique and delicious that it should almost render Heady Topper its own category of spirit. Heady is the best beer in the universe.
"Probably on people's bucket list for beers to drink in their lifetime. I've been there, done that."
"L: Slightly murky color, pale straw, nice thick head with decent lacing – 4.5, S: Wonderfully hoppy aroma with hint of tangerine and sweet sour dough, notes of tropical fruit and perhaps apricot – 4.5, T: Nice hop bite, pine and grapefruit, faint overripe peach flavors perhaps, slightly astringent – 4.5, F: Subtle thickness and lingering viscosity – 4.75 O: Delightfully complex beer that continues to evolve with subsequent sips – 4.5"
"What can I say, this is probably among the top three beers I've ever had and while thru the years I've had batches that have been better than others overall it is a game changing beer. Funny thing, I really prefer a little bit of age on it as fresh fresh I find it's a bit harsh. Surprised I've never submitted a rating."
"Everyone's gotta try it once, right? Good beer. ""drink from the can"" is a little misleading - I suspect they just tell you to do that because hazy ipas weren't a thing back when this came out, and they wanted to avoid people being dissuaded by the look of it. Good experience overall, but I like focal banger much more."
God-like
Received recently from @GreenBayBa via @Ocalafox. Certainly a beer that is highly touted. Normally I prefer a std IPA over a hazy NEIPA. This one was very good. Hit pretty mush everything one would expect of an IPA . Thought there was minimal haze which is fine w me. Given the chance would definitely have again. Thanks Guys. I understand the hype !
Look low score as drink from can!
"Best IPA I have tasted, hands down. It's drinkable, enjoyable, and downright satisfying."
"Won my favorite in a blind tasting against other big boys, so it gets a 5 in my book."
A: Pours a hazy golden yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing
"Look - given that the beer says ""drink from the can"" on it, I only poured out a very small amount of the beer out to judge its look. Straw yellow in color, and cloudy. Not much head (most likely from the small pour), but lacing is present."
Full bodied beer. Great pine aroma with citrus tastes and bitter hoppiness. This beer has an extremely strong aftertaste and you continue to taste blasts of hops long after you sip. The best IPA I’ve had.
"DATE: August 30, 2018... OCCASION: Celebrating the first day of my twentieth year in education with a beer whose history is equally worth celebrating... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours from a can not three days old, thanks to Jeff and his Vermont-NJ dual citizenship... builds a four-finger, snow white head of thick, bubbly clumps that cling and web down the glass... its body is golden orange, hazy and bubbly, illuminated when light passes through... impressive first impression: a wall of resinous pine, pineapple, melon, orange, and lemon, merging with fragrant musky basement flowers... further, hard fruits of apple and pear swirl with a hearty, lightly toasted malt backbone... at 8%, this sips smoothly, with a lively tooth rattle and a simmering finish that leaves a strong resinous aftertaste... orange peel and grapefruit reign in this deluge of citric storm--a delivery on its promise to maximize its hop experience... something in this is also unique--the air and yeast create the dankness that ups its ante... start to finish, nothing NOT to like about this beer--big, bold, respectful, flavorful, fresh and hoppy.... this destination beer is indeed worthwhile, and I could only imagine having a few on a nightly basis, which i what this was meant to do, even at its IBUs....I am so thankful Jeff wrangled this for me...BIG experience crossed off the beer bucket list!"
Drank from the can except for a pour into a taster to assess appearance
Been a few years since my last can. Even better than I remember.
Fresh cans from 8/3/18. Tastes best after a couple weeks imo. 
"Thanks to CW who muled this back from his trip to the NE...been waiting a long long time to try this one. Since I had a cold the day it was dropped off, I held off a week, until I could appreciate it properly.....so we're probably at about a month since canning. Anyway, here goes: I don't care what the can says, I'm pouring it into my trusty nonic: glad I did, since I wouldn't want to miss this beer's nose. Cloudy (but not milky) warm gold, 1 1/2 finger white head of medium tight bubbles, decent retention, decent lacing. Nose is pretty huge with tropical fruits (with more round and less sharp flavor profiles) and a warm bready malty undercurrent that complements all the mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and passion fruit notes extremely well...there are layers, but each one just brings more of the same. Taste follows the nose pretty well...extremely full and harmonious flavor profile. Really smooth, there is really no bite or bitterness, at all; the malts lay down a fairly substantial mouthful over which the hops really shine without popping or biting. For my own tastes, the finish meanders a little and isn't as memorable as the other dimensions of the beer. All in all, really really good beer...would love to try it side-by-side with Abrasive, my local go-to dipa."
"from a can, honey colored, barely hazy, strong notes of mango, grapefruit, piney on the backside. so nice. I wish it was more widely available."
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Been waiting to get my hands on some for a bit and finally did at the beverage center in Winooski. Can’t judge on appearance since I drank from the can but seemed like a hazy amber color. Has a present hoppy taste and smooth finish that sticks with you; feels like the flavor is glued to the inside of your mouth. No bitterness noted however alcohol is present in the smell. Overall great beer glad I was able to get my hands on it!
"The epitomy of a north east IPA. Hazy, citrusy, slight maltiness. Solid!"
"Finger plus of clean white foam, settles into an even surface, looks dense but it sizzles off quickly before your eyes, minimal lacing, a random splotch here or there. Deep yellow and hazy liquid, however, much more translucent than opaque, you can see enough bubbles to suspect there’s even more there you can’t see. while there is an initial whiff of dank marijuana to the nose leading up to the super-juicy tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus, mango, peach, apricot and melon fruit scents, solid underpinning of cocoa and vanilla bean malts, croissant flakes, well balanced and not bitingly hoppy, lasts well without coming off as brawny for brawn’s sake. Medium-bodied, dry mouth entry with a momentary tacky sensation. Quickly switches gears to pine sap, mint and all of that grapefruit and orange citrus. Odd in that it is indeed very hoppy but in such a way that all the rough edges have been burred off. More of a burnt character to the mocha, cocoa here, malts less sweet. The papaya, mango, pineapple to apricot fruit offers equal parts sour and sweet. Carbonation tends towards the fluffier side of things. Shows balance and poise for its scale, a reputation well earned."
"Perfect balance of smell tast and finish, great IPA. Hard to get."
"Been waiting to try this elusive beer for a while now. Finally got to do so today while visiting home in Boston. Pours a rich dirty gold. Upon the first sip, I didn't notice anything that spectacular, and then it hit me. Lots of awesome hoppy goodness with no juice-bomb BS that characterizes most IPAs now (thank you, beer gods). I can see why this beer is legendary. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is specifically because my taste buds want more flower power in my IPA. Excellent beer. Try it for yourself (if you can!). I definitely hope to do so again soon."
I've had this beer several times and it is awesome.
"Having had this beer multiple times over several years now, this is my first time officially reviewing it; and, every year it's a steadfast, yet mind-blowingly impressive beverage. Even though I can grab this locally on consistent basis I still leave room in my cooler every time I visit VT. So, while maybe not worth the drive anymore, it's a beer I'd never pass up. Onto the tasting which was picked up from Stowe 1 wk ago."
"Poured just enough into a glass (2oz) so I could look at it, will drink the rest from the can. Fairly clear (I'm sure there are floaties in the can) honey yellow with a white head. Aroma is citrusy, hoppy, piney. Flavor is sweet and hoppy up front and has more malt backbone than I was expecting. Medium body feel. Very nice beer, would love to have it super fresh (not sure the age of this one) and/or on tap at the source."
Amazing!
One of the beers I would consider a gold standard. Classic balanced taste that never gets old. This is one of those rare things that lives up to the hype.
A: Poured into a tulip to a hazy golden yellow topped by a dense two finger white head which fades slowly and leaves excellent lacing
Great beer. A lot of drops happen in NYC making it fairly accessible. Has a traditional IPA taste with a lot of resin.
A: hazy deep amber color with a hint of burnt orange. Large amount of glories and a 1 finger frothy white head
The best
Great beer but don't really see the hype for it
"what am I missing? this is just a slightly above average ipa, yet they come into our market, not allowing sales of cans.. really? who needs them? there are so many outstanding ipas now being made in the northeast. I think Alchemist needs to put more effort into their beer.."
"I know you're supposed to drink this straight from the can, so I took a sip before pouring some into a tulip. I just had to see it, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. This is a beautiful beer. Nothing crazy or different, it just looks... right. Big, fluffy head, that takes its time to fizzle out. Smell, as everyone says, is full of citrus and pine. Flavor is right there as well, with a distinct, resinous, dankness on the finish. Not gonna blow your mind by being something no other beer is or will ever be, but absolutely deserving of being on everyone's 'must try' list."
Lives up to the hype.
TOO hoppy not worth the difficulty to obtain some nor the price-
Because nothing is perfect... But almost with this super (double) IPA !
"This one a gift from outdoor7or24 who made a pilgrimage to the brewery. Pours a hazy grapefruit juice gold producing 2 fingers of glowing white, somewhat lasting head. Aroma is fruity, citrusy grapefruit, pale bready malt & spun sugar/cotton candy. Taste is similar to the nose with a perfectly balanced finish that transitions to a pleasant bitterness. The most unique thing about this brew to my mind is its mouthfeel: slick, creamy and slightly viscous with a tiny pricke that fades to an astringent bitterness. Absolutely delightful!"
"I finally got to taste HeadyTopper. It was at my favorite brunch spot near me. What a Fathers day surprise. I easily quaffed 3 cans with my food. This beer is all it was supposed to be. Aroma of juicy citru and piney hops, with an excellent aftertaste, smooth as can be for a IPA. This my highest rating on Beer advocate. Great job guys."
"Very good, very hyped, so my reaction is colored by expectation. Sharp, clean, nice bitterness, cloudy yellow color. Reminded me very much of Neshaminy Creek's A Shape Of Hops To Come."
Luxury IPA. Love to pair with havarti cheese.
Very good beer but doesn't come close to the reputation. Not in same class as Treehouse Double IPAs. Not worth the trip to Vermont.
"Consumed from a can roughly 2 months old, probably a little past its prime but I doubt it matters much."
The best of the best
"I was skeptical. I was expecting just another disappointing Double NEIPA that has been unjustly hyped. Turns out, this is excellent. Excellent enough to make the trek to Vermont and stand in a long line for a 4-pack? No. But it's one of the best NEIPAs I've had. "
Great beer - btw you have to pour it into a glass guys to have a look rating but I have just consumed this beer out of the can which is what it wants. :-)
"Looks a bit hazy and full. Better to drink out of the can as the aroma of hops will escape on a pour. Smells extra malty and hoppy. Full of flavor tastes great and feels smooth. Overall an Epic beer and easy drink. Hops may contain: Amarillo, Centennial, Cascade and definitely Citra."
16 oz can poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass.
"Drink frosty from the can. Smooth, almost creamy front, bit of a thin, bubbly finish. Doesn't feel heavy by any means. no big hoppy hit like you might expect, more even throughout, which is probably why literally every human being likes this beer."
"Fragrances of pine, grass and notes of dankness. Smooth start with a tiny bit of hop in the middle, finish is blended well with a feel of hydration. Would recommend but definitely not rated as Many others have."
Damn good beer......
Poured from 16oz can (yes I know it says drink from the can but I have 4) into Snifter glass. No date.
Did you like pop rocks as a kid? Well...I did.
Really nice piney aroma. This is really balanced with nice hop flavor and light malt character. Very nice beer.
Look: hazy
"Everyone should strive to taste this beer. This double IPA is the epitome of a great beer, the taste and color are just right. Just as the can says to drink it from the can. Do not pour this beer into a glass the hoppy smell and taste isn't nearly as great."
"Classic gold, thinner head that settles into a whispy pool. Softer tropical notes on the nose, ripe melon, pear, stobefruit, kiss of grassy hop. Flavor is very delicate and cajoling, more melon, grassy hops that are not too bitter, wheat grass, dry orange, cracker straw malt. In today’s world not the most flashy IPA but the balance is masterful and it remains a classic"
Sampled about half of the can by pouring it into a 9.75 ounce arome glass and the rest directly from the 16 ounce can itself (gotta do what the can tells you).
F I N A L L Y !
By far the best IPA I've ever had .. snatched some up luckily this past labor day weekend in Stowe Vermont where I'll be returning this memorial day weekend to hopefully get my hands on some more .. the mouth feel .. smell .. perfect aftertaste etc makes this my favorite beer easily..
What can I say? Top 5 beer I have ever had.
"16oz can undated purchased at the brewery. Gold color and citrusy/hoppy nose. Very flavorful and balanced between malt and hops. Complex flavors such as citrus rind, peach, mango and orange come through with others in the background. Very smooth and easy drinking. Delicious! Right up there with TH Julius as our favorite so far. It's probably a good thing for our budget that we have to travel 6 Hours to buy more."
Drank from can
Love this beer so much can't wait to try it again!
Had 3 month old can. Very smooth and delicious
"Fantastic taste for an IPA, aftertaste is nice; does not linger for long."
The pinnacle of human achievement. The perfect balance. Incredibly satisfying as no taste over or underwhelms any other. Our favorite beer. A masterpiece.
Just slightly hazed golden color with good effervescence and three-plus fingers of yellow-tinted head. Soapy lacing.
Definitely one of top IPA's I have ever had
"excellent complexity, lasting flavor profile. magnificent"
"It’s a good beer..,.but I honestly don’t understand the hype. I’ve had better IPAs that aren’t ranked as high as heady. I gave it a little lower score on look because I drank it from the can....like it recommends to do on the can. But every beer has good color to me lol"
"As I raised the can for my first sip, I was punched in the nose by the pine tree smell. My first thought was, this might be a bit much. When it hit my mouth, I thought, OK, this isn't over the top hopped. "
"Not much new here, Just one of the best beers in the world, year in and year out. Great IPA, however at this point conceded and posh, plenty of better ones out there. That being said still World Class!"
Look is tough since they say to drink in the can! Amazing beer.
"I have yet to drink any IPA/IIPA that achieves such a amazing balance in so many places. The malt backbone stands up to the hops perfectly, yet neither aspect distracts from the other. The balance of pine and citrus is just absolutely perfect. Heady continues to impress."
"Extremely hoppy, bitter, fruity, and strong. After-taste is negligible and not bad. First few sips do not do the magic because of the relative bitterness, but as you sip on, it grows on you. A few moments later you cannot stop sipping. In a couple of hours, you possibly can gather your senses to call an Uber. "
"Hands down, the most well-balanced IPA I’ve ever had! Extremely pleasant hoppy taste with a light nodes of citrus. My new standard for IPA’s"
Have been drinking this beauty since they began canning it and still can't find a better IPA. It sets the standard for pleasure and complexity in all dimensions.
Horribly overrated...The best thing in Stowe VT is the skiing not this beer
Fantastic Hoppy Flavor with a burst of Citrus!
Drink from the can...
"This review is not for the beer snobs who use words like ""earthy"", ""piney"", ""zesty"", and ""mouthfeel"". It's for the regular guy who appreciates excellent beer, but not necessarily overly elaborate descriptions. There's nothing wrong with beer snobs, so don’t take offense. I guess I’m one myself since I unapologetically carry my own cooler to parties just in case crappy beer being served (yes, I take enough for others), but I have too many other interests and hobbies to learn the lingo. So on to the review..."
"I waited to have the entire 4 pack before writing this review. The first one I had, I ignored the brewer’s instruction and poured it into a 12 oz snifter. The smell and taste were extremely raw, almost like eating raw hops. The smell was the same, like those of hops after being entered into the boil. The beer had so much hop and yeast in it that it looked like a swampy mess. To be honest, I was not impressed."
"Waited about 5 years to try it. Absolutely delicious. I'm not sure if it met the expectations of 5 years of hype, but nothing could. Did not disappoint, and I wish I had more than 3. Lingering, delicious hops just seem to last forever. I love it!"
This beer always checks all the boxes for me. The original juicy hop bomb!
"There's nothing I can add to this beer's past reviews... except it's delicious, and hype worthy!"
"A hazy orange(I poured some out despite the cans strict instructions not to) beer with a clean, refreshing taste packed with flavor and aroma."
"Way overdue rating this beer.. live in Vermont half year (warm part) and Florida the rest ( warm again - bingo!). Had this beer early on and hated it. Actually spit it out a beer festival in Burlington. Since then, as I have belatedly matured as a beer drinker, I have come to love this beer. It is refreshing, clean and yes hoppy! It is my go to non- dark brew (love stouts, porters, brown ales, dunkels etc). Sorry for taking so long to come around to this great beer"
Sooooo Damnnnn Gooooood
"Been a long time since I enjoyed a Topper that much. I was clearly exercising a lack of patience with the cans I had obtained in late November 2017. Now I am firmly convinced the sweet spot is 8-10 weeks from canning. I drank all but 1 and was curious why I wasn't as impressed as on previous occasions. Let me tell you at 9 weeks the look, smell, flavor, and feel transported me to the other side of the room."
"Worth the trip and the wait. Heady is always a top DIPA! NOT for aging, it will have sediment after only a few weeks. I recommend using a glass, but pouring a small amount (1/5) of a can into a small snifter and then downing the last 5th from the can."
Outstanding beer
"Pours a hazy, bright orange coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is very hoppy, with quite sweet, juicy and slightly zesty notes of citrus and tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach; with the merest hint of a certain, dank grassiness and pine. Bit of cat pee there as well. Taste is incredibly hoppy with almost no detectable malt presence at all, just the slightest hint of biscuity malt. Quite sweet, juicy and slightly dank notes of citrus and tropical fruits: grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, peach that are greatly balanced. There's also a very definitive grassiness to this. I'm not really getting a very resinous character from it, but there is just a hint of pine coming through. Finishes quite bittersweet, with a moderate bitterness that could be considered strong for the style. The Mouthfeel is incredible here, very smooth soft and effervescent, Medium Body and carbonation. So this is the fabled Heady Topper. I can totally see why it's been labeled as the original NEIPA and honestly don't get the controversy that some people like to put on it. This is very sweet and juicy and neither as resinous nor bitter as some people claim, although the bitterness is high for the style. Also, I was quite surprised to not find a single floater in my glass after pouring this into it."
It's perfect. I want it to be overrated but its not. The benchmark
Liked the creamy texture.
The hype is real!
"Smooth start nice hoppy aroma, even smoother finish."
"Great brew, was surprised to see as # 3. Reason why I was lower was due to feel and taste, I felt like it died too quickly after a gulp vs. others. Still great overall and will continue to buy when possible."
my first time getting a whole case!!! wonderful!! I got one for my bday.....now I live kind of close to Stowe...so good! $5 a beer but so worth it! just wish they let you take more then a case out of the brewery so I could get some focal banger which is also wonderful! next time up there!!
L: pours cloudy light orange with a big fluffy white head. 
This is an amazing beer! Yes... drink it out of the can if you want! Not sure why the guy on the can is not doing the same! So hard to get down in the NYC area!
"Sooo good but very hard to come by. Your best bet is to locate a store where the beer is sold, find out when they receive their delivery, and wait in the parking lot. Seriously. That said, this beer is the center of much hype and you can just as easily swing by a local pizza joint and order one."
"Distinct grapefruit with light hop nose, with a powerful kick of fresh hops on body and finish; super tasty."
Worth a weekend roadtrip 1.1K miles to score a case!
"look: Not particularly special, a nice, semi-cloudy with some lacing. Solid look, hazy gold"
This beer lives up to the hype.
"Pours a golden, opaque yellow with a thick white foamy head with a nice mixture of bubble sizes. A very bright color, really nice. "
16oz can into Nonic Pint
"I just recently ""converted"" to IPA style beers. I found this one to be very palatable and enjoyed it out of the can and in a glass. It did not leave me with a bitter after-taste and definitely was worthwhile throughout. The color was as expected from an IPA and the taste was smooth and piney. I will look for it again, perhaps some day enjoying it from the tap."
A really good beer. Solid as they say.
"On tap, it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. In cans it’s one of the best."
Reviewed on 4/15/16 from notes
Certainly a good IPA.
"It's great now that the Stowe brewery makes getting this alot easier than it used to be; only a six hour drive and I am restocked! The hunt was a lot of fun in the old days, I'll admit. I love IPAs and try different brewers efforts regularly, but find my self coming back to HT time and time again. It is truly the benchmark, both in the can and in an appropriate glass (also available at your local Heady retailer!)."
The perfect DIPA.
"Bought in Vermont, drank one in Vermont, then shipped the rest back to California."
Good
"I was lucky enough to stumble across a 4-Pack of HT in surprisingly enough, a Yankee swap party. Having been on a Sip of Sunshine binge it was immediately apparent that HT is in a class of its own. The crack of the can followed by a beautiful burst of hoppy goodness flooding out of the can was just the beginning. If smell is the first attribute to consuming food then HT nails it with this been. Citrus, crisp evergreen, everything right about an IPA fills your nose with immense pleasure. All this before you even take a sip. Taste is complex, smooth, perfectly balanced and finishes with a clean sophisticated flavor which resonates for just the right amount of time before you indulge again. "
"Basically as good as everyone says it is. The hallmark of this beer is its complexity. It displays virtually every delicious facet of hops: ripe tropicality, fresh citrus fruitiness, and a strong botanical element that suggests evergreen and damp earth. Perfectly situated in between single and double IPA. It is both very dry and richly flavored, with a delicate finish that invites many more sips. A very special beer. [fresh 16 oz. can into pint glass]"
"Outstanding beer. Very light head, fragrant in the nose. Taste comprises delicious juice with complementary bitterness. Appearance breaks with NE style haze and is fairly clear. Slightly more maltiness than anticipated."
As good as noted. But there are so many other great ones the gap is closing
"smells of citrus, good body. Flavors of sour citrus with late pine bitterness/resin. As advertised, really drinks well from the can."
"Pours a very cloudy yellow color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Very good citrus aroma with piney undertones. Blends very well. Aroma is similar to a NEIPA, but the taste is definitely not. Very smooth taste. Fresh citrus taste with a strong piney hop. Definite bitterness in the aftertaste that linger for a while. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
"The definitive East coast IPA, with a citrus/pine flavor that is somehow both full and light at the same time. Many come close, but none has quite captured the hoppy delight of this brew."
"Drank from the can, but poured a 2 oz sample into a glass to see the appearance. Pale golden color with a half finger head the lingers and has slowly fading bubbles on top of the liquid. Nose is the bar that NE IPA's shoot for with citrus, pine, and lime peel. Taste is a delicate balance of earthy, citrus, and pine hops with a mildly bitter finish from hop oils. Medium body and medium-high carbonation with a dash of hop essence that lingers."
One of the best beers ever.
One of the most well-rounded ipas ever.
"I had cases of this. It's a very good IPA. Is it better than, say, Abner or Dinner or two dozen other top-notch IPAs? No. A Very good beer, but not in the upper echelons of IPAs."
"Drank it from the can as the canon proclaims. Completely crisp freshness, just juice and tree hops gliding into you with no way to think that the 8% is there."
One of the kings of VT for sure. The smell and taste are uniquely Alchemist for sure.
Had a couple times. Nice bright juicy IPA.
"16 oz can with no date on it. Enjoyed on Thanksgiving at my brother-in-law's. This is my second rumble with Heady. First time I had it was at my bachelor party but was too ""preoccupied"" to review, let's say."
"No reason to leave a lengthy review. Shits clearly legit and the scores are spot on. I am usually a fan of sharing but not this one, take it when you can get it."
"Scored only my second case in six years. Resin and citrus almost from a petrochemical plant. All in the best way imaginable. Oh how I adore this beer. Malty bitter sweet, lingering after. Each sip reveals a different character from orange to grapefruit to balsam pine forest. 1 of 24 to be had from a can. I'm willing to share, but few I know want to live the experience. Yum!"
Enjoyed throughly!
"Love this beer and it's a treat every time. Well balanced, great aroma, amazing flavor. The brand is surely ahead of itself at this point because of continuous review by craft beer circles, but it's phenomenal."
Look- Slight haziness with a vibrant golden color.
Hard to rate the look when the can tells you to drink from the can and not to pour into a glass
"To the chagrin of the can's descript, it was poured in a glass...very good"
The standard
This is what you drove 8 hours to pick up. Enjoy it.
"Incredible. So much better than Tree House IPAs it's unbelievable. Couldn't have had more hype to live up to, and it did. It's the Tiesto of IPAs, want so much more of this."
Tried side by side a can of Focal Banger
"Solid DIPA, over hyped though?"
This beer was everything I wanted it to be. Nice and hoppy. Could not even tell that it was 8% because it was so smooth. If only it was available in Indiana. Thank god for friends that travel.
"This thing fires on all cylinders from start to finish, what a world class beer."
"Great beer. Worthy of the hype. Love the unfiltered orange look. Aroma is bright, citrus, orange. Taste is hoppy and dank. I am glad they put the brakes on the dankness it made a nice balance. Feel is full and smooth. Hardcore but well worth a try."
Had in Burlington at a couple restaurants - it did not disappoint. Great beer across the board with strong emphasis on the nice hoppy taste and rich flavor
"I've had a number of Headys from the same batch over seven months, and this is sort of a combined review. It held up very well, but looks quite different at seven months than fresh."
Good friend gave it me.shipped cross country.excellent
"This stuff isn't pretty to look at. But the aroma, taste, and feel are the best of the best. It's the gold standard to judge all other doubles against and to date nothing can touch it."
Look: hazy golden coloration with a thick foam head
Hazy apricot colored with huge whit pillowy head.
Lives up to it's hype. Just a all around solid brew.
It took me a LONG time to get these. This is near perfection. The color of the unfiltered juice is amazing. The smells hit your nose and you can really smell the citrus but it's not overwhelming. Tasting it makes you giggle. I'm not an expert but this was worth the hype. Now I'm hooked on unfiltered!
Excellent IPA. Slightly higher bitters than TreeHouse's Julius. Slightly lighter in color. Excellent aroma and rich flavors
Finally diving into this. No date on the can.
Traded with my buddy Mark for this can (Thanks!) and really looking forward to trying it out.
"Truly one of the best, if not the best, DIPA on the market. So balanced you really can't tell it's an 8% beer. Wonderful."
"Sample at the brewery, then got two 4-packs. Better than Focal Banger and Crusher (smoothest). Probably prefer TH, but can see this as trailblazer."
"Solid mouthfeel, hoppy and complex. Well balanced"
"Great beer, something I never thought I would have"
did the kimmich recommended 10 week aging challenge. it was amazing. (g.o.a.t.) to live at a time where the greatest of anything occurs is an honor. here is heady topper. young or aged. live your life! enjoy the 
This is right up there with Tree House and Trillium as one of the Best IPAs I've had.
Awesome New England style IPA being the original in a sense. Some others have caught up and passed this legend.
"16oz can received courtesy of @JHavs and his mini-assault on my doorstep. While there's a 4-pk holder in the box with a sticker showing a date of June 23, I don't know if it goes with this or one of the other 4 beers he sent me."
Cloudy straw color with slight white head. Aroma is hoppy with slight me citrus. Taste is also hoppy with a more significant citrus accent that is both sweet and bitter. Very complex
"First I'll start by saying I did not buy into all the hype surrounding this beer. However, when I finally tasted it I was surprised and can understand why this has such a cult following. Great quality and a unique taste that definitely makes this stick out in an over saturated micro brewery market. It is definitely a bit bitter and not incredibly smooth which should come as no surprise, but the floral note and light after taste are addictive. Even those who do not love IPAs will most likely appreciate a can of Heady Topper. Also the art is awesome."
"Pours an opaque orange-amber with a thin white head. The aroma is all tropical fruit and citrus leaping from the glass. Starts off with sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes, fading to a very mild bitter finish. The malt is more then enough to balance out the bitterness. It has a full mouthfeel, and is very inviting. This is a top notch IIPA, and I can see why people are trying to imitate it."
"Well, ranked ninth overall on August 1st had to try it out. Tasted incredible at brewery itself so if you can go there although sold out for purchase currently but did find some in town for sale. For sure, didnt disappoint. Stunningly light for a double. Deceptively easy to drink for its potency. Did the can drink and yes does make a difference but poured into a true tulip - available at the store for purchase too! Poured light orange gold. Fruit smells abound and a great taste goin down. Worth the hype!"
"What a great beer!!!! Following instructions, I took the first sips straight from the can. Huge citrus hops presence, mangos, tangerines and grapefruit with a resiny, oily hops finish. The hop presence is bitter but not a head shrinking hops bomb. There must be a malt balance here somewhere, but the malt does not interfere with the hoppy taste - just provides some balance. The aroma is just as impressive as the taste. OK, its time to have a look at this in a glass. Pours a hazy, dense straw yellow color into a pint glass. It takes a hard pour to obtain a big white head, but with a hard pour, the head is large and frothy with excellent retention. Bands of wide lacing on the glass, once again with good retention. The lacing lasted as long as the beer. Maybe I'm just falling for the hype, but I believe I will drink my remaining 3 beers straight from the can, The aroma and flavor are much more prominent and overpowering straight from the can!!! Mouthfeel is crisp and rich. No hint of 8% abv. I could have drank another one and be surprised when the strength caught up with me!!!! Bitterness is good but not overpowering and the oily resiny presence is surprising considering there is so much citrus in the taste. I don't go crazy looking for hard-to-find beers anymore, but a friend took this as a challenge and sent me a 4 pack. If you can find this beer - get it!!! It is that good!!!!!"
The fluffy white foam reaches one inch and lingers for the duration. A fine webbing of lace coats the Spiegelau IIPA glass. The beer is murky gold (SRM 5-6) with casual carbonation throughout.
"Thin and disappointing, especially because of the huge hype."
"Drank directly from the can, as recommended."
The Winner and Still Champion.
One of the best I've had. Very drinkable
"Very hop foreword through out the entire drinking process, from cracking the can to swallowing the nectar. Almost too hoppy, like chewing on a pine tree at some points, although still consider it to be an archetypal IIPA (while still probably not my favorite)"
"500ml can. Yellow liquid with a small white head. Nose is hoppy, fruity, grapefruit, exotic fruits, you can’t just stay there, you need to drink it, it is too inviting, can find some caramel malt as well. Taste is just as amazing as nose, once you take a sip you just can’t stop, abv isn’t even felt, you drink is like this is no tomorrow. A lovely IPA for sure."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy golden with a dense pillow of white atop (4.25). Aroma is a remarkable balance of sweet malt and juicy hops, no bitterness or overly strong smells, mouth watering (4.5). Flavors are a different animal, with a mighty blast of hop dominating the sip from start to finish. Never harsh, and never too bitter, but always present. You can sense the malt in its backdrop just letting the Hops shine (4.75). Finishes ridiculously clean, not too dry, and just asking for another sip (4.75). Overall just fantastic stuff for my tastes (4.5)."
Look - slight haze golden color with good slight head and sticky lacing
"Slightly hazy yellow color with two finger head and consumed in a snifter, sorry... Great floral and hop aromas. Smooth and creamy texture with cream vanilla and orange citrus flavors. Big, hoppy and full bodied mouthful, but so well balanced with all the other flavors. This is one of the smoothest and tastiest IIPA's I've ever had!"
2017 review:
"I am no beer connoisseur. I do not know the lingo, or even how to describe a taste so well. All I can say is is, that this my favorite beer to date. I started getting into IPA's on a trip to Burlington/Stowe last summer, and since have been on a search for delicious IPA's. This is the best I have had, hands down. Gorgeous, deliciousness, wonderful buzz feeling. I look forward to visiting my friends country house again to indulge!"
"All of these components are close to being a 5, great IPA! The smell is definitely a 5. I enjoyed this emensly, definitely seek it out. Again I have to thank my buddy Dave!"
"Too many hops for one sip. It needs more balance, whether that be balancing with the grain, or balancing with the variety of hops. It's like saying the best chili is the hottest chili."
"This was the first IPA that I fell in love with. Hop city is an understatement. Cloudy as all get out, juicy with some hop burn. Great beer."
too bitter. somewhat disappointed.
"A beer that excels in balance. Most NE IPA's are being built around this beer as the example. It's lush, vibrant, yet restrained. "
"Not usually a fan of IPA, but this one is truly exceptional. The hops are in perfect balance with the sweetness from the malt. The flavor profile is intense and complex yet smooth and enjoyable; without question it lives up to it's reputation. The Bavarian brewers would be jealous of this beer."
"The hype is real! Was able to finally procure this beer from a guy who lives in VT. Thanks so much, Jason! Amazing Beer! Definitely in my top 5 of all time."
Hard to beat this perfect IPA.
"One was poured into a snifter and the other was drank out of the can. The appearance in the snifter was a hazy burnt orange color with a ton of floaties surrounding the body. The head was about a finger’s worth of white foaminess. There was some light lacing sticking nicely to the sides of the glass. The smell out of the can and glass was basically the same as it was pure citrus to piney hops that ended up assaulting my nose in a nice bitter/dank sort of way. The taste between the can and the glass was the same as it was pure bittersweetness from the hops. Even as this one warms, the sweetness comes from the hops and not the malts. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was sharp due to the style and was much expected. Overall, an absolutely wonderful DIPA to me."
"This is the epitome of an IPA, we have a house 40 minutes from the Alchemist brewery and this beer was one of the main reasons we decided to buy a ski house in Vermont. Only negative thing I have to say is it leaves you a little thirsty. Has a big bite to it so be wary."
This is the perfect use of hops. Never have I had a better IPA and I doubt I ever will. Well worth a trip to Vermont to pick up a few four packs of this fine craftsmanship.
Look is hazy dark straw with bright white head.
"It is, without a doubt, my go-to beer."
I clearly cannot add anything that hasn't already been said. 
Pours a hazy lighter straw yellow with a nice bright white head. Decent lacing down the glass. Nose is dominated by citrus. Grapefruit pith and orange peal. Taste is also citrus forward. Very bright and crisp clean citrus fruits that yields way to pine bark. Getting a bit of that oniony taste that sometimes crops up but it is very light and minimal. Beer gets juicier as it warms. Medium body with a bright clean finish to it. Nice little bitter kick as it goes down that reminds you your're drinking a fine Heady Topper. Glad I finally tried this one
Perfect
"From Bierkrafr. In Teku glass. Watching Looper. Resinous, with pineapple notes. Very balanced and tasty but wont give it full score because some subtle veggie notes not completely pleasant"
"Not a beer expert by any means, just some who likes beer. To me it definitely got better as the beer got warmer and I felt that it was better out of the can. My expectations were set pretty high. Definitely a great beer, but I was expecting more."
Perfectly balance. Strong hop punch to start with a smooth citrus finish that cruises you into the sunset
"Lots of grapefruit, hazy. Very reminiscent of Hair of the Dog's Blue Dot when it was good."
Look: Out of a can but I know the hazy Heady from many experiences. 
"A friend of mine brought one down from a visit to the brewery for me. Nothing better than owing a Top 10 beer to a friend, I returned the favor with Pliny the Elder. "
Enjoyed from a can. 
"Beer is a light golden orange color and very hazy. A massive 3 finger head settles down to about one finger after a few minutes, very good head retentention. Aromas of dank pine hit you up front followed by citrus, grapefruit, and esters. The taste is a hop bomb of pine and bitterness with subtle notes of grapefruit. There are also biscuit notes from the malt as the beer warms up. The beer is carbonated very dry giving it a very hop forward character. Overall a world class beer."
"No ""canned on"" or ""enjoy by"" date, but the pack was picked up from the brewery about a week ago, so pretty effing fresh, and poured into the only glass available, a narrow cylindrical pint glass at my inn. Pours a suuuper hazy bright golden color with about an inch or so of stable white head and leaves hella lacing all the way down. Smell is just a bit faint but is exactly what I want from a NE IPA. Loads of pine resin and grapefruit zest/juice. Taste is on point. Balanced, but still rather in-your-face dank resinous character, the same citrusy pop but way more juicy and bold on the palate than on the nose. As you swallow, the pine character builds up even more and lingers on the tongue for ages. Medium body with medium carbonation, all adding to the surprisingly balanced character of this beer. Overall, it may deserve all the hype it gets, but there is a reason this is so sought after. This stuff is bangin'! Super hoppy and yet still finds its proper balance, at least as much balance as an IIPA can really have. Feeling lucky to have gotten this. Sidenote- is highly recommend not drinking straight from the can, regardless of what it says. I did half in the can and half in a glass, and dammit, the glass really does a lot for the aroma. Just don't worry about the floaty bits. That's just character."
Drinking first half from the can
I think I may have had an old can of this....Got a very malty backbone and a weird sweetness
Very smooth and flavorful beer.
"still my favorite beer despite trying all the other contenders here in New England (i.e. Julius, Sip of Sunshine, etc.). the last batch I picked up at the brewery is just perfect. however, I seemed to notice that within 4 weeks of canning it seems to be the best."
It's the gold standard. You may try others and think they are better. But you'll always come back and say this is great.
"This beer just doesn't live up to the hype for me. An exceptional beer that I'd always be happy to drink but leaves me feeling underwhelmed. For me it doesn't stand up to what Tree House and Trillium are doing. Probably just my personal taste, everybody seems to love it."
"I just had the chance to have this stand alone beer for the first time this weekend and let me tell you it has all the characturistics of a World champion... oh thats right it it won four years in a row !!! I drank it out of the can as directed so as for color I can only figure it is great in color... to go along with the rest of my review. The taste is superb from the beginning to the end. The choice of hops is top notch with a smooth mouth feel with several different fruit notes with a great finish. It is a beer to sit, relax, and enjoy, but tough to do. Since you want to keep going back for more mouth euphoria."
"I drank this beer from the can as it indicates to do on the label. Hits all the marks for me. It has a great hoppy flavor and aroma. As one reviewer mentioned, it is a hop bomb in your mouth. It goes down very smoothly. Perfect amount of carbonation and just enough bite at the end. If you get the chance, read the can, it is pretty funny."
"cloud orange pour ( N.E. IPA normal) with decent amount of fuzzy, white head"
Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass.
"Probably the best beer I've ever had, and I'm not one to over hype IPAs. It's everything you've heard and more."
"Bright floral, first IPA I every had that was a super hoppy resin IPA"
One of the best double Ipa's I have ever tasted.
To the eye. A beautiful blonde color pale somewhat orange but hardly. Beautiful thick and aerated sparkling collar very great remarkable effervescence in this following to the observation of the beautiful big bubbles rising quickly towards the top of the glass. Color rather cloudy but not completely opaque.
"Look - Pours a hazy honey color, two fingers of bone white head. Great retention, lacing all the way down the glass. Worthy of a picture."
OVERRATED
The beer that got me into my very expensive hobby.
Great
drank straight from the can so look is from memory as I've had this beer several times and look varies depending on age. I'm guessing this can is 6-8 weeks old.
"Awesome, awesome beer from a great brewer. Everything from Alchemist is terrific, but this one is special. Drink it right from the can, like the can suggests, and you won't be disappointed."
Can definitely testify to the validity of this ale. A friend of mine was extremely emphatic about it and got some for me after visiting Vermont. Definitely one one of the best I've ever had
Had a customer from Vermont at the store I work at in Rhode Island bring this in for me. I'm a big fan of citrusy IPA's.
"This beer is more than just a beer but an event HAHA. The color is amazing bright hazy yellow. The flavors on the pallet are grapefruit, orange peel, lemon. Lots of citrus, with a ton of bitter flavor."
"This is an overall consensus from having drank easily over a hundred Headys since the canning inception. We have a saying around here, if there's nothing exciting on tap: ""Fine, I'll bitch out and have a Heady."" I've had it on draft locally as well as sampled from the old cannery and the new brewery. I've had a year old Heady that was crystal clear and absolutely spectacular. Unless it's poorly kept or somehow oxidized, it never sucks. The recipe has changed over time but the enjoyment never fades!"
"Poured a bit into the glass but drank this from the can as directed. A hazy bright yellow-golden color with a resilient white head. Big aromas of grapefruit, pine, tangerines. Huge hops on the palate, similar to the nose. A nice bitter mix of the citrus and the resiny, piney earth tones. Medium-bodied and perfectly carbed. Awesome beer."
Amazing beer.
Drank from the can. Poured a bit into a tulip to see the color. 
"Bought this on a trip, was flying home, wish I would have drove. I wish I could have a case shipped to Louisiana."
"I have had the pleasure of drinking this former #1 several years in a row now. 2017 now and it still lives up to the hype every year. Gave it a 5 on look cause I never have poured it out to look at it, so I rated the awesome can art. I will be awaiting next year's tasting ."
"This legendary eastern ipa is what inspired my signing up to ba to launch this bashing..err review. I like Maine beers, I like knee deep beers, i like mosaic hops. Honestly I was ecstatic when my buddy brought home a plethora of alchemist beers. Focal banger should be right up my alley but its so over the top i have to blend it but when i do i still enjoy big mosaic hops. Heady is just foul. I realize my opinion is an outlier but when I tell you I struggled to finish a can (ipa drinking wife included) Im very serious. I had it on 2 occasions to cement my feelings on it and they are this beer is soooooooooooooooo overrated I'm in awe of how lousy it was for me, really nothing redeeming to say other than at 8%abv if you can hold your nose and slam a few of these i guess you'll be in a happy place but i can give you myriad other options to better get you there."
I have been to the mountain top
"A fantastic beer and a rare find. The beer lives up to its reputation as being one of the best around. For a tousle IPA, it has a subtle hoppy finish with a very complicated taste. Definitely drink from the can, its intriguing and complex."
This beer has its reputation for a reason. Glad I was finally able to score 1!
"The anticipation was enormous, the taste was pretty good. A friend had to take two work days off to drive to Vermont to pick up two cans for me. It was pretty good, but so are others right here in Ontario, CAN."
"Outstanding IPA, very tropical, grapefruit, orange and pineapple. It's juicy and pithy with tons of pine. The bitter finish lingers for a bit longer than I'd like, but overall I can't complain about this beer. It's absolutely world class."
Really just a perfect beer. Enjoyed first in Burlington at a Nepalese restaurant and recently thanks to a generous friend who sent a 4 pack of this and Focal. Really just a standout beer.
"Look: Orange, hazy, with a two inch head."
Poured out to share with a friend. Cloudy golden yellow color with a small white head. It smelled of tropical fruits and caramel sweetness. Good balance of bitter and sweet.
Can of course
1 PINT can
I base my taste of other beer around this one.
This is the sweetest nectar to touch my lips with the exception of my beautiful wifes love juice. I have 6 more of the nectar of the gods that I will enjoy only on the most special occasions.
It was everything I heard
highly overrated...try JVP (Joseph Vincent Paterno) instead of this
having this on tap at the alchemist reopened my eyes at how good this beer is
"Thanks for the trade Ross! Color is a vibrant yellow-straw with minimal haze....I had to pour a few ounces into a tasting glass despite the command to drink from the can. Didn't pour enough to get any discernible head. The smell is outrageous with lemon, orange, hop resin...it really is a delightful smell. The taste is very juicy and it doesn't get washed out by the carbonation or hops. I am getting an orange rind and piney dry finish. A medium-full body with a soft mouth-feel, again the carbonation is present but not overpowering, this is particularly applicable when consumed from the can. "
"Had this on the Jersey Shire out of the can as suggested on the label. Very tasty. Lived up to expectations, which were on the high end. Most notable for that complex cloudy almost resinous, multidimensional flavor and look."
Drank from can as intended
Probably the most overrated beer I've ever had. (Have not had Pliny yet)
I poured a nice tulip half way and left some head. Great golden color. A very light hop in my opinion. Nothing stands out and smacks you in the face - that's good. A nice balance. Some fruit notes but nothing that stands out or leaves a bad or bitter taste.
"Look: Poured approx. 1 to 2 oz into tulip glass for look purposes only, the rest drank from the can. Pours a light gold/yellow color. Translucent, and moderately cloudy. Leaves some small and big bubbles with a small amount of white head. Leaves a characteristic lacing around the glass."
"Drove to the new Alchemist and purchased the max of each beer. I've had Heady-Topper before, and was very excited to taste the joys of my 12 hour round trip drive. "
"So I tried this amazing beer for the first time... holy mother of all beers was t amazing I had Lord Hobos consulation prize at my all time fav. but heady & topper well, tops it lol I'm in love all over again."
Nosed f-Ed this guy for awhile. Loved it.
"It goes without saying that this is an exceptional beer. Appearance is a cloudy gold (thank you for not turning this into a murky swamp beer like some of your peers), small and taste continues to be a tidal wave of perfectly balanced hops."
"I must be a terrible man, but I don't drink this beer from the can. I can't say anything different or add much to the reviews below, but this may be the perfect IPA, and deserves to be enjoyed with every sense."
"Let's be real... Reviewing Heady is like giving an acceptance speech for someone you barely know. At least in my case. It's an icon, and who the hell am I to tell you what Heady is all about. All well, I'll do my best anyway..."
It's a truly awesome beer.
Needless to say...Alchemist lived up to the reputation. This was a the first time experiencing Heady. Tried it in a glass at first in the brewery. Then drank another the next day in the can as it said to. It was rather smooth to be honest with you. Flavors of citrus was well balanced with the hoppy taste. Overall very happy I was able to get my hands on some.
"My favorite beer so far, its delicious"
"Pouring Heady Topper from the ""Drink from the Can"" pint can reveals a hazy, fiery orange liquid with a foamy, tightly laced, white head. Head foams up quickly, peaking at 3 fingers with an aggressive start and conservative finish. Retention on the head is great, lasting even through a half dozen sips. Lacing bubbles around the glass, with great retention. Aroma is steeped in layers of citrus, with notes of orange, lemon zest, and papaya. Biscuit malts bunch up just behind the hops to form an assertive, but refreshingly delicate hoppy aroma. Flavor profile opens with a smooth crescendo of citrus, orange, lemon zest, and biscuit malts. A hoppy start flexes and reshapes itself into a malty finish - with a little resin hop at the end to stick to the palate. Mouth feel is smooth and somewhat filling with a medium thickness. Feel certainly has a presence, but is still light enough to be enjoyed swiftly on a blisteringly hot day. Overall, a sublime IPA with plenty of flavorful body, and presence. The lack of a bitter stinging finish makes this an easy beer to enjoy for folks both new to IPAs and old. "
"I have one a few times a year, always great beer and each time I had a different experience."
"Undoubtedly a very good DIPA; however, it did not live up to the hype as one of the best beers in the U.S. for me. In my opinion, it is not even the best beer by The Alchemist (an excellent brewer)."
New England DIPA. 8% ABV.
LOVE IT
Poured to a tulip glass.
"Ah, heady topper. Had several times but this is my first time writing a review. Ignored the advice on the can, of course, and poured into a tulip."
Have to drink it fresh as the quality slips after about a week.
Mostly drank out of can as instructed. Pours hazy gold with a medium head that is foamy doesn't last
Holy sweet mother of pearl that's exceptional. It's a bigger beer than Focal Banger? I get so... 7% vs 8%.
"13,005th person to tell you this beer is amazing. A must have double IPA."
Will always be a favorite.
"Honestly, best beer I've ever had and I didn't even have it fresh. My aunt who lives in Ireland bought some in the states and she saved some for me when I went and visited her in Ireland."
Simply one of the best! My number one of any style beer. Not even going to try and describe it you just have to try it! Just drink it fresh it does loose a little something over time. Best right off the truck or go to the brewery
"After a great family day, of finally skiing with my southern born family, due to military life. I asked for a plain beer...then a great buddy said I had to try this one. I declined, stating I just need any beer. He refused, presenting me the Heady Topper. I was blown away. Taste, Smell, Sight,...Best Ever. Been around the world, drank lots of famous beers. Amazed at the taste of Heady Topper. Only problem, I am not the only one who agrees and it's very hard to get. Impossible down south."
One of my favs
"I'm not one for IPAs, so I had to check my bias, but I can see why Heady Topper is hyped like it is. I first drank it straight from the can as recommended, ice cold at a restaurant in Burlington. It goes down unbelievably smooth for a Double IPA, and it finishes just as clean. The flavor is filled to the brim with high quality hops. Not my cup of tea, but for the IPA freak, it's worth the trip to cozy Vermont."
"L-clear, often with little floaters"
"I have been digging NE IPAs since they've been so big lately in SoCal and decided to spend a wad getting this (fresh) out west, it was way worth it. I also ordered Crushed and Focal Banger as part of the haul, but this is the original so he goes first. Poured the first HT into a cold tulip glass without swirling to peep the glory then the second out of the can. The can experience was far better, I actually preferred it colder. Nice light yellow hazy honey color with a finger high head and pretty lacing which coated the glass even after it was gone."
"Fortunate enough to bring in the new year with two cans. Neighbor had a friend bring some down in September...keeping the cans ice cold the entire way to Maryland. I was forced to drink it from the can...per the instructions and the insistence of my neighbor, so the look and smell are both 5. Taste was very good, but didn't blow me away. The mouthfeel was very good for a double IPA and I never did want to stop drinking it. I want it more now that I can't easily get it here in Maryland. Will be road tripping to Vermont very soon. I want to try it poured into a cold pint glass."
"Poured from can into snifter (couldn't quite follow the can rules). Hazy straw color with fluffy white head that had excellent retention and lacing. Scent was grapefruit, lemon, a touch of mango, and very piny. The flavor followed the scent with a high bitterness that was balanced well with the smooth sweet malt. Quite a resinous taste/feel on this one. The mouthfeel made this beer stand out. I've only had a few beers that match this mouthfeel on an IPA, almost seems to coat your mouth with smoothness while maintaining a crispness from the carbonation. Great beer!"
"I'm guessing the few bad reviews are the result of someone getting an old can or one that got too warm. I generally do not like IPA'so that are over 7% ABV - too many hops to mask the sweetness. This ale is so well balanced and not at all heavy. My son who goes to school in Vermont brought me a case for Christmas. The best gift I've ever gotten. Truly lives up to the hype. It is extremely important that you do not let this ale get warm, that will totally funk it ul."
First time trying to coveted brew. It was about 8 days old.
"First time! Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a lovely golden-amber color with two full fingers of fluffy, egg-white head and lacing with excellent retention. I don't understand why so many claim it has to be drunk from the can because of its appearance. It's a very attractive pour. It smells of bready malt, grass, pine needles, lemon peel, and grapefruit. Wow, what a perfect balance of malt, fruit, and hops! The first taste is somewhat sweet, bready malt. It's no fruit bomb; the citrus is subtle, delicate. There are touches of tropical sweetness and vanilla, particularly as the glass warms a little. Then the hops explode, bitter and biting. The after taste is bitter - in a good way. This ale it medium-bodied, with pleasant carbonation, and a reasonable 8% ABV that allows for easy drinking. You can down a couple of these. Overall, it's an exquisite DIPA and merits its lofty ratings. I'm glad I was finally able to experience it. Road trip to Vermont?"
One of my favorites. Wish I could get it more often.
Damn. Finally got my hands on this and I can honestly say it lives up to the hype.
"Creature of habit, I opened it and immediately poured it into tulip glass. Sorry bro...."
"While instructed to drink from the can, most of the review (besides the first few smells and sips) was poured into my Pliny the Elder pint glass (ironic, I know). "
One of my favorite beers!
"16 oz can poured into a tulip for review purposes. Only available in Vermont, acquired through a trade. "
"Good beer, I was expecting more."
"Can't rate the look since it's canned. I actually expected more of a pungent kick from such an esteemed IPA but the overall character and mouth feel is very tame. Subtle dryness with moderate grassy/pine notes. Fairly light on the carbonation as well. Overall, a fantastic beer but a little underwhelming I must say. On par with the Jacks Abby Kiwi Rising I tried last week which isn't nearly as exclusive."
"Heady Topper has a hoppy smell with a hazy look. This tastes like a mouthful of hops and the feeling is a great one. Overall, I feel like this is a drink you can't pass on."
"Finally acquired a couple cans in a trade. It was quite tasty! Had the first can from a glass, beautiful hazy orange gold, nice hoppy aroma, citrusy piney taste but a little weaker than expected. Second can from the can and definitely much better, taste lingered on the palate, very smooth texture. A very good brew!"
"From a 16oz can at a Burlington restaurant. I had to ask for a glass to look at it, which received a scornful look from the waitress. They do take ""Drink from the Can"" seriously."
"Seriously amazing. I was surprised at how smooth and drinkable this beer truly was. I will absolutely seek out again. One thing I did pick up was a faint cucumber taste, but holy cow this thing is amazing."
Pours a hazy golden yellow with a tinge towards the red spectrum with a good amount of things suspended in the beer. The smell is rather complex and smells like tropical fruit punch. Notes of papaya and mango with just a hint of peach. The taste does not entirely follow the smell but is not nearly as complex. Tropical fruit juice in the middle but finishes with mango. The back end is a tad too bitter for my tastes but most would enjoy it. feel is medium bodied. Overall this is a really good beer that is a tad too bitter for my own tastes.
11/18/16
Excellent beer with a nice finish. Taste sits in your mouth with a nice silky feeling long after the last gulp.
Was very excited to try this benchmark IPA and am not at all disappointed. It is delicious.
"First had 8/30/13 at a friends house. One of many, and hopefully many more. The water in Vermont plays a huge role in all of these fantastic beers that come out of that area. Or it could be something else, either way, I love when friends go up and bring me some home."
As good as advertised. Amazing taste lingers on your toungue. Great aroma upon pour into pint glass. I actually wasn't blown away by the look but still very pleasant. Lighter than I expected. Great feel and aftertaste. Plus beer as I expected.
Finally. A beautiful looking unfiltered beer. The nose was more tame than I expected. Great taste. Super well balanced Silky smooth feel. A very solid beer. But not the best. Maybe the hype was too much.
"Bit underwhelming.... maybe too much hype, maybe my expectations were to high, or maybe there are just a lot of other great IPAs out there these days. It's a great beer, but mostly just a tick off the list."
Super excited to try the venerable Heady Topper! I did not drink from the can but I did pour it without rolling the can so as not to disturb the sediment. 
Enjoyed it.....it's probably not worth the hype......but it's very very good.
"Finally tried it. Had (of course) in the can, though I poured an ounce or two into a teku to get the appearance. Poured a hazy yellow (thicker, and hazier than most DIPAs). Pine and citrus on the nose, though not to the incredible extreme of The Crusher. Palate is tremendously dank, bitter hops. Pine is more present than citrus, though both certainly play a role in the palate here. Solid medium mouthfeel. An exceptional DIPA, but in the world of extremely good IPAs, this one is not so singular as the hype would imply. Tremendous? Of course. Best in its class? Sadly not."
"Decent beer, if you're into an IPA. A little too hoppy for me however."
Appearance: yellow-golden with a white head with good retention that fades to a thin lacing. 
"I have drank almost everything from #1 to #25 and others on the list. I drive to VT every so often to pick up 2 cases and drive back to MA. Why? Simply said, this is the best beer (DIPA) in America. I also drive to the TH and drink all their beers too. I have not had Pliney The Younger so I can't comment on that, but it's only in a keg form and can't get the CA to try it. I have had Pliney the Elder though. Heady, as it's affectionately called, when fresh, far exceeds anything in its class. I have had many of the Tree house beers, and they are really good and deserve spots on the list but no IPA or DIPA from TH is as good as Heady. King Julius is close. I have both Heady and TH beers in my frig at all times and enjoy them all. I wont comment on what I taste or how it pours because it's different for most people. Find someone that has fresh heady and trade with them and you will see why a large majority of people think it's the best they ever had."
Can Date: purchased 10/14/16
"So I did half of Focal from a Can and half from glass, as a result I did the whole of Heady from the Can."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades slowly to a ring leaving a good lace. Hazy light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hop nose and flavor is pine and grapefruit, occasional hints of caramel. Lingering pine hop bitterness. With most raters saying this DIPA is the best I expected more. Dogfish 90 minute is better. $15.03 for a 4-pak of 16oz cans from Montpelier Discount Beverage Montpelier, VT."
Crawl into the can!
"Acquired in a trade. I was told the canned date was 10/8. I have a hard time believing this with the lack of hop aroma and taste. I could speculate what it'd be like fresh as I've had many fresh IPAs and IPAs past their prime. Rating this off of the told canned date. Doesn't hold up well at all if the canned date is 10/8. Smell and taste of fresh hop aromas was non-existent. Malty flavor, tasted like an old IPA."
"So, when a friend offered to sell me 12 fresh cans at face price, I had to jump on it. I was surprised to see the disclaimer on the can that encouraged one to drink it directly from the can. I'm actually a fan of that practice. Overall, this beer is very well-balanced. It's excellent. I would drink it again. I probably wouldn't drive 12 hours to get it though. Not sure I understand how this is #6 on the all time list. "
Unknown vintage; drank 2/7/15 @ California Split. 
"Citrusy, herbal, hoppy flavor. FULL of hops, in both it's aroma and flavor. Behind the citrusy, bitter, grassy, herbal, dank hops, it has notes of pear and light tropical fruit. Creamy, almost foamy mouthfeel. It was a great tasting, enjoyable beer, but with all the great IPA's out there, I don't see exactly what sets this one so far above the rest."
Had this at Manhattan Pizza in Burlington from a can. 
"Orange! Smells sweet and piney and fresh. Taste is sweet grapefruit and herbal, resinous, mild bitterness on the back end, very smooth. Lighter bodied and moderate carbonation"
"This is a phenomenal IPA, but falls short of all of the hype it receives in my opinion. Each time I have had it, I am expecting to be completely wow'd, however, it ends up being just a beer that I greatly enjoy drinking."
"Waited in a gas station convenience store in the middle of nowhere Vermont on a Wednesday afternoon in a line that was 50 people deep to get one case of this stuff. Let me tell you, worth the wait and it lives up to all the hype. I've had a lot of hoppy IPAs, but this is unique and the only way I can describe it is that it is very floral. You immediately smell the hops, like you took a big handful of the freshest hops and crushed it up in your hands and stuffed your nose in it. The taste matches it, very floral and bright, but not too bitter in the back. Smooth finish and makes you crave more. Guess I'm going to have to head back up to the middle of nowhere Vermont to get some more as soon as it's gone, definitely worth it."
Appearance: Hazy cloud of dark lemon yellow to orange with a generous two fat fingers of fluffy white head and plenty of lacing and retention is amazing dissipates like a giant tortoise makes love.
1 for look since it has to be drank from the can I wasn't allowed to look! ;)
Drank out of the can outside ohare international airport with the love of my life on our way to Vegas baby! A little bitter/hoppy for my palate but I understand the hype. Not as juicy as I thought it would be but still enjoyable.
Taste is too strong. Wouldn't want any more than 1
Pours - Cloudy orange color super thick foamy white head with tons of lacing.
"I had Heady several times. I do think it is a really good beer, don't get me wrong. It is a world class beer. It is by far the best beer that Alchemist brewery has to offer. I just feel like there are a lot of beers in New England that gives heady a run for its money without the hassle of trying to get your hands on it."
This is an exquisite fresh beer! I like to have just one and then switch to a different brew.
"It was a few weeks ago so I won't get too specific here in terms of looks smell taste feel, but this is an amazing beer. I have been searching for it for a long time, and a friend came through for me. The can I had was probably a little older than it ideally should have been, if that had not been the case I may have to go 5 on this... hard to imagine a better beer of this style."
"Honey, lemon juice, cloudy in texture with little visible carbonation. Topped with 3 fingers of white, foamy head."
"Last Friday and Saturday I visited the new brewery/tasting room/sales center in Waterbury and enjoyed HT on tap, and, subsequently, poured into a standard pint glass and then, as recommended, directly from the can. Try it for yourself, but I thought it tasted much better in a glass, where the wonderful blend of hops opened up. We were in NE for a wedding, and the extra ten hours we drove to partake and purchase were well rewarded. The wait was not bad on Friday, but there was a longer line on Saturday. Sufficient product was available both days."
Great IPA but not as good as focal banger or other new england ipas
16 oz. can
From last night.
"Gave it a 5 for looks, simply because I wasn't going to give it less when I have no idea what it looks like since I drink it from the can as instructed."
Great beer! My heart still lies with Treehouse but this beer is incredible!
Fantastic. My Top 5 beers of all time
Awesome taste from the first sip to the last.
"Finally got the chance to try Heady courtesy of a buddy who shipped me a can. Probably 2+ months old, poured into a tulip glass. Look is a golden-straw color, slightly hazy, well carbonated, with a fluffy white head that holds well and laces gently. Smell is initially fairly subdued, with grapefruit rind and citrus, dank, dank grassiness, light biscuit, sweet tropical fruit, and a little onion. As the beer warms those aromas intensify greatly and wonderfully, especially the sweet tropical fruit and dankness. Taste is honestly more mellowed than I expected. Definitely juicy and fruity and citrusy, but not really uniquely so. But so damn drinkable. Soft bitterness, grassy herbalness, and light biscuit to go along with the citrus and tropical fruitiness. Goes down so damn easy. Feel is fuller than it looks, quite silky and luscious. Really wonderful beer. The hype would be hard for any beer to live up to, especially one that is intended to be extra-crushable. Certainly will drink it any time I can, and will continue to seek out opportunities for it, but not sure I would say it's the best IIPA I've ever had in a world where many brewers are pushing the sensory envelope. But man I wish I had easier access to it, because this is one you'd love to have on hand at all times."
Poured from a 16 of can into a tulip glass. 
L: murky hazy orange. Big head and retention.
Tasty treat from Bennington Vt.
Loved it! Had the opportunity to share with some friends that have tried every IPA. They all said it is fantastic. Taste is great. Drinking out of the can works as well as in a glass. This one will not dissapoint.
L - Hazy orange with two fingers of white head
Best beer I have ever had as 2015.
"Rarely if ever had a beer with such aroma from a can that it permeates the entire space. That being said, that is the best part about this beer. Too sweet, alcohol is quite present, and has a lingering bitterness that some people love but I find overwhelming. Still great but not worth the hype. Focal Banger is more deserving of this."
I was pretty excited to try this beer after hearing so much about it. It was a very good beer but it was not my favorite double IPA.
"Clearly, the best beer ever brewed. Love it! First tried it in the Burlington Airport. Friends talked me into trying it. I thought, well, it is another beer. News flash: It is not any other beer, but the best beer. The hops seem to wrap around your brain and you float away to another world."
"For me, just a perfectly balanced IPA. Fresh, herbal, piney, just enough citrus, crisp, but soft enough to be juicy. Love it all around, and one of those beers that deserves the hype. That being said, I'll probably very rarely drink it unless I happen to be in Vermont and happen to be at some place that actually has it- and that's okay. As good as it is, just drink fresh and local when it comes to IPAs- there are plenty of amazing, or at least very solid ones out there, and all over the place."
with all the hype usually most things disappoint the Topper does not. the beer is a must try.
"I liked the beer, but did not think that the taste was enough different than many others to get such a great review. But I will take a case of them at any time!!"
"Do believe the hype, but the difficulty of getting ahold of some (having to stake out stores or plan your day around procuring a 4-pack) gets frustrating."
Just what the world has been waiting for: another Heady review...
"appearance- Golden in color with a slight amber hue, hazy bordering on turbid, and pours a fizzy two inch head."
"I was lucky enough to pick up 8 of these on a trip through Vermont last year. Certainly it's a famous 'whale' athough perhaps less of a whale after the expansion. Update: My wife and I were able to grab another 32 cans this summer. At time of drinking, it was the best beer I'd ever tasted & now the beer to which I compare all PAs upon tasting. When you open the can, you get hit with a citrus/pine aroma hop blast even if you're not all that up close that is refreshing all on its own even before tasting. Then put in a mouthful & let the full hop taste cover your tongue & hit you with citrus/melon/pine/dank flavours before fading to a faint bitterness that is pleasant, unlike many IPAs, so much so that I hesitate to use the word bitterness. I've had 5 now & switched to drinking from the can as per instructions. Even though I think it's all in my head, it's tasting even better that way. My favourite way to savour one of these: Open at around 8C or a few degrees above fridge temperature. Open outside on a nice hot day & enjoy the aroma & the fantastic flavour of the first few sips. Then, jiggle it up a bit to let a bit of the carbonation subside & enjoy the increased smoothness & slightly altered flavours for the 2nd half of the can. Beer heaven!"
"So this is supposed to be the Holy Grail of beer! I'm drinking from the can first like it says to. As you open the can you can smell sweet hops, very fruity but then comes the pine. Exactly what you'd expect from such a hyped beer. Took the first few sips from the can and its hard to explain how good this beer is. I will fall into the category of people who may overhype this beer but it was delicious! I feel it taste better when poured into a good IPA glass. I will be making trips to Vermont any chance I get to have this and anything else The Alchemist have to offer."
"The starting point for all NE hazy IPAs, this and Tree House changed my perspective on beer. "
Over Rated! Good beer not a 100 I live here and dont understand the hype. Many many beers equal to or much better that are not rated so high..
Drank majority out of the can. Poured a bit into a tulip for look and because I usually drink out of a tulip.
"I have never had a better balanced beer of any style. This is quite simply, incredible! Thanks to Mr Kennedy for sourcing it!"
"Drank out of can as instructed by can, sooo, look was irrelevant. Citrus, specifically papaya on the nose, giving way to mellow, smooth finish. Yum."
"After years of hearing all the hype about this brew, and wondering if I'd ever get the chance to try it without making a special trip to Vermont, I finally hold a can of this ""whale"" in my hand. I'd like to give a special thanks to Jason for this amazing gift. My excitement is mounting, time to crack it open... "
"Finally got a hold of one after many years of longing...it was delicious no doubt, but not life-altering as I expected. The aroma is killer: fresh cut grass, grapefruit, hit you immediately and you know you have something really good. Finishes with a mild bitterness that stays on the tongue but not obtrusively. You'd never know it's 8% based on taste."
"I really wanted to love this beer, but to me it was just ok"
"So much hype, but almost worth it. An amazing beer - certainly one of the best I've ever had. Not sure I'd wait in long lines for a 4-pack, but I'd also never turn one down!"
"I've had this beer a number of times and most recently at a restaurant serving it in the Burlington area. IMO, it is still an outstanding beer, but in this one can I drank it seemed different - thinner, less of a mouth feel to it along with fainter smell and taste. I believe the increase in production over the past few years may have something to do with it or possibly it was an off can or even my own taste buds changing. Still wouldn't pass on a 4-pack though!"
"I just tasted Heady Topper from the can as instructed. Hop aroma of citrus, piney and some dank. Tastes explodes with carbonation bitterness. This dies down and the hop flavors explode, peach, mango and grapefruit. WOW ! ! ! What just happened ? Another taste and WOW ! ! ! ! ! "
Poured from can into glass. Golden honey color with minimal head and medium bubbles. Smells of bitter citrus but with something a little off. Mouth feel is slightly syrupy. Tastes like a hoppy fresh cranberry and a little malty.
Great dipa. Not 'juicy' like some other northeast dipas but nice thick hop taste. Has a pleasant bite to it.
"This is the beer that i base other other beers upon. I may be a touch bias, i live 3 hours from Burlington and can get this beer semi regularly if needed. but, for the money this thing is the benchmark of everything else and until something else hits my lips this is my unicorn."
Good but Focal Bamger is better :)
"Enjoyed straight from the can as directed. Not sure on the date, but I know it was canned over a month ago."
"This is the best beer I have had the pleasure of drinking. The aroma was thick with hoppy goodness. First drink did not carry as much hop flavor as the nose indicates, but that is okay. No bitterness whatever with this beer. There are no other adjectives that I can assign....all I can say is this is what all IPAs should aspire to be."
"Had this about a year ago, can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. Pour is a golden, nearing straw yellow hue. Frothy tight white bubbled head, excellent lacing on the glass. With the aroma, I have no other way to explain it other than the perfect array of hops. A certain dankness in the back end, back door with a tropical sweetness of mangos, pinneapple, guava. No maltiness detected. Taste follows the nose well, with a burst of tropical resinous hops, even a funky yeast presence with a burst of piney, palate coating goodness. Pretty much the perfect IPA, nothing gimmicky or typical ""NE hazy""-like. It's in its own lane, and deserves every bit of hype."
"The mighty Heady Topper! Been drinking it for years now. Finally reviewing it. Golden yellow in appearance. Haze for days. Smells like a combination of grapefruit, freshly cut grass, and pine. Taste mostly follows the nose. The finish is incredible. The leftover hop flavors that cling to your tongue are delightful without over doing it. "
Can from Lee
What a treat to drink a beer like Heady Topper that lives up to it's reputation. Imperial IPA's are my favorite style so I have had plenty and this has to be a top 3. If you ever have the opportunity to drink one of these bad boys don't pass it up.
"Heady Topper is by far my overall favorite. Its been a while since I have actually looked at the color since I drink Heady directly from the can when I can. I live in Florida and Vacation during the summer in Vermont I highly recommend the whole immersive cultural experience of getting Heady Topper fresh by any means possible which may include stalking the beer truck on delivery day, or waiting online at one of the delivery locations in close proximity to their brewery in Waterbury Vermont. Upon popping open a Heady Topper the smell is intense and Hoppy as is the taste, there is a slight bitterness with your first sip which dissipates quickly leaving your palate yearning for more. With balanced carbonation the mouth feel is that of pure refreshment."
"I live in Vermont and have had Heady Topper many times, mostly when its the only thing to drink at a party. I remember the first time, I gagged and I thought that someone had given me a beer and spiked it with fresh cut grass clippings. I know I'm in the minority up here but I'm tried of all the craft breweries trying to cram as many hops as they can into a can of beer."
Truly exceptional!
Perfection in a can.
"Consumed both fresh from the can and poured into a tulip glass. Review is based on from the can, which was the superior tasting experience."
"The Alchemist ""Heady Topper"""
Great all around beer... Only gets better from here.
DRINK FROM THE CAN!
Best dipa I've ever had
"OMG!!! Love this beer and thank god I have a friend in Burlington that can get it to me here in Florida and Maine. I've got about 1/2 of a case in my beer fridge right now and I'm nurturing it along. So easy to drink. TOO damn easy to drink actually. I've even lined up an hour early (with about 75 people in front of me) at the Winooski Warehouse for, as it turned out a half case) of FRESH Heady. Happy to get that."
"Had this many times but nothing compares to being in Vermont and the truck pulls up and the parade of hand trucks goes into the Craft Beer Cellar in Waterbury. Mouth dropped! Taste way different then ones I had back home, that where muled from Vermont. Drink from the CAN!"
"Excellent, very hopped with a long, smooth ending."
"Lived up to the hype, for real. "
Updated 8/9/16; consumed from a can picked up same day from new brewery.
Perfect IPA
Had it shipped to Colorado just to taste this icon of an IPA and boy howdy!
"Drank out of the can, so no 'look' rating here. Heavy heavy hops, thick mouthfeel and lots of malt. Overall hop flavor is not super juicy or aromatic like a Julius or PseudoSue, but great quality nonetheless."
Best DIPA I've ever had. Fuss warranted.
Hopefully the new brewery will make it easier to get.
A favorite with nice hoppiness and citrus flavors. Never saw color as drank from the can.
Overrated
Look: Amber. Mostly translucent but a slight haze; 20% opacity. Little creamy head; most dissipated fairly quickly but held at the rim throughout the drink. 
"Thick, smells like hops, and tastes like heaven."
Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass from a 16.9oz can
Revisited 10/30/18
"L: hazy, straw"
One of the best DIPA!! My only complaint is having to drive 2hrs to get and there have been times it was sold out. When will this be distributed in NH???
"By far my second favorite IPA of all time, only slightly outclassed by Sip of Sunshine. This beer will forever held a dear place in my gut. <3"
Smell: tropical fruit notes grapefruit orange pine floral grassy.
"I never liked IPA's until I had a Heady. Now, I'll never go back to flat tasteless beers. This beer is just bursting with fresh hoppy goodness, there is nothing like it."
If you can get your hands on this beer. Get it and keep it.
"Says ""Drink from the can"" so I did, but I also poured my next one, floral, citrus armoa, taste again is very earthy like, super bitter. Looking forward to comparing with Pliny the Elder but I feel like I will still prefer heady."
"Tasted from a 16 oz can on May 29, 2016. Look is unknown. Smell is hoppy with ester, herb, mint and orange aromas. Taste is bitter citrus, hop oil and orange with some sweet malt flavors. Feel is medium in body with a bitter and somewhat dry finish."
Just not my style.
"Drank straight from the can--just superb in all the sense, the mouthfeel was rich and creamy. The perceived bitterness was immediately countered by the incredible mouthfeel, completely relaxed my palate and left me totally satisfied."
Without question the best IPA that I've ever had.
What's left to say that hasn't already been said? Just an incredible drinking experience.
the best IPA I never taste for me thank you for make it .
"A solid IPA for sure, but definitely not a top 5 beer. Had this as fresh as you could get it (and numerous subsequently) and never found this to be anything special. If I end in VT again, I will definitely drink it, but will not go out of my way to seek it out."
Drank from can and glass. Under week old.
"The look of this beer is very nice, a slightly hazy yellow wheat in color with a full white head. The smell is amazing, fruity, citrus, lemon peel. The taste is even better. Starting with the fruity and citrus flavor and ending with a little more bitter pine flavor. Definitely not overly bitter for my palate and it hangs on the tongue for the perfect finish. Mouth feel is very close to perfection and extremely smooth. Overall this is one of the greatest IPAs out there. It still holds its own against the newer ""juicy"" style of IPA. It is a must try for any beer lover."
"Yep, I cheated and poured 1 of my 4 cans into glasses."
"So I tested this, julius, haze, and SOS at the same time and these were the results (with all being canned within 7 days of each other)"
"Only a couple days old, poured into a pint glass. Cloudy with about an inch of white. This is the best smelling beer ever. Flowers, cut grass/pine, citrus. Substantial mouthfeel without being syrupy. Extremely well-balanced hop/malt profile. Extremely well-done."
"I've had it both in the can and in a glass. For a review I guess I need at least a bit of a look....it has a nice yellow haze with a decent head. Aroma from the can, however, is truly outstanding. Fresh hops, perfectly balanced betweeb pine and citrus. Flavor has a nice bite that leans more towards the bitterness end of a hop flavor profile. Wish there was just a little more malt, but then it would probably be even higher in alcohol. Mouthfeel a little cloying....and I mean little. But why complain? This is a great beer, thoroughly enjoyable, and well worth the hype. So many great IPAs, so little time."
"Classic for a reason. Lots of fruit showing, and juicy mouthfeel. It is worth tracking this one down. Had it from the can, as advised to do. Slightly cloudy orangey color. Not quite as hoppy as Focal Banger."
"Pint can. Poured most into a tulip, had a little from the can as per the instructions. Paired with Maine potato vegetable soup, Vermont sharp cheddar, and some crusty bread with garlic."
"Well done, but a bit more resinous than I prefer"
"Overrated. Ommegang's Nirvana and Long Trail's Limbo are much better IPAs and they don't require you to drink them ""in the can"" to taste good."
Surprising flavor will buy again!!
"Traded a Hipster Brunch for a can. Simply put, best IPA I've ever had"
"Another all hype beer in my opinion. Do t get me wrong, it's a tasty beer and not your typical malt forward East Coast IPA but I was left wanting more. More body, more aroma, more hop flavors, he'll even more bitter hops. It all seemed a little muted to me. I'll definately try it again, maybe mine were older or didn't ship well?"
"Drank during a blind taste test with other top notch beers. Very solid IPA, but doesn't live up to the hype IMO. Pours light gold color with not much head. Very crisp and smooth."
Drank straight from the 16oz can (no date) at 48°F. Consumed on 05May16.
One of the best IPA's I've had. Those Trillium brews have really skewed me on what is THE BEST though. Great look and aroma and awesome blend of citrus with a piney bite. Nice blend of new wave hazy and flavor of traditional standard. Got much better as it warmed up.
"Hoppy citrus aroma. Hoppy start, citrus, pineapple almost a light pineapple. Very complex yet sooooo smooth. Exceptional well made. Light pepper finish."
had about 10 cans of topper over the last year or two. 
im finally in possession of one of these again. used to live off this stuff when brewery was allowing no limits. I poured this and did not drink from the can. after I let the floaties settle I notice nice hazy light orange with minimal head retention. nice fresh nose of orange rind and tangerine. taste follows nose with up front grapefruit and pineapple with some pine floating around somewhere. mouth is a little thin but does not retract from the beer. the initial taste is followed by a surprising increase in flavor that creams your palate and works all the way to the end with dry finish. this beer is phenominal and has tons of flavor from start to finish. bright citrisy notes are abundant and my mouth puckers as the beer goes down. im drinking this after doppleganger from treehouse and dopple gets the nod. heady may not be what I remember it to be but still a world class beer that is worthy of the hype.
Pours a very murky pale gold in color with a billowing frothy white head that seems to hang on forever. A significant amount of lacing on the glass. Very pleasing to the eye.
"Had out of a can at Cold Hollow Cider Mill in Waterbury, VT. Drank out of the can but I poured some into a cup to get a better look at the beer. The beer had this medium tone yellow appearance with great retention. Aromas were great with this slightly cooked pine and orange peel with a citrus balance that was really mouth watering. Taste follows the nose with this sharp hoppy flavor mixed with citrus of mostly orange and grapefruit. Excellent carbonation to this beer, which makes it really drinkable. Overall, a really good DIPA."
Great taste
"Drank from the can so I can't say much about how it looked other than it was deep golden in color. Aromas of pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange. Tastes absolutely incredible and follows the aroma perfectly, very slightly bitter and a slight floral presence. Medium bodied and carbonated. It took me a very long time to find my first can, hoping it wont take nearly as long to find more."
Everything the hype lead it to be. Amazing beer
Appearance: You should definitely drink this out of the can.
Deep Gold in color and cloudy with little head and no lacing.
"Appearance: pours a hazy golden yellow color with a 1"" head that falls to a thick surface covering. Mild lace develops during the session."
Gotta drink it fresh! Would drive 10 hours to Vermont just to get some.
Harder to get every year but always worth getting. Easily one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Aroma is wonderful. Taste is unbeatable. Love this beer.
The hype is justified with this one.
Yes!! Just say yes to Heady
Lives up to the hype
"Against the wishes of the brewers, this comes out of the can a very light creamy yellow, but then darkens in the glass to a partially opaque yellow orange. The carbo-pillar in the center is still visible, supporting the large foam head well. Heady Topper retains an unbelievably soft, fluffy thin blanket, with spotty fluid lacing throughout."
"This is one of the best DIPAs on the planet. We first experienced this at the brewery, when it was open to the public. On tap, it is unbeatable and in a can still one of the finest."
Almost perfect
"Heady Topper is a world class IPA. Although the turbidity isn't as strong as Hill Farmstead or Tree House, Heady is somewhat translucent yellow. I smell some oranges, grapefruit, and lemons. The taste has some medium bitterness up front with a slightly tart, lemony note following. The taste hits early on and falls off rather quickly and cleanly for great drinkability for 8% abv. Overall, fabulous beer. Nevertheless, I think Julius surpasses Heady due to its creaminess."
"Not really an IPA guy but this is really good! Crisp, good mouthfeel, a lot of fruity flavors and clean finish! Highly recommended!"
Drank half from the can and half from a snifter. I prefer it from the glass. 
"Had the first sip out of the can because I can't completely ignore directions. Tons of grapefruit. It pours cloudy with nice head which doesn't linger very long or leave a ton of lacing. No hop chunks in this can. Smell is very good but it didn't fully live up to my very high expectations. Taste is great and easily one of the best DIPAs I've had with the bitterness only coming in hard in the aftertaste. Crazy drinkable at 8%. That said, I'm still not sure it lived up to my expectations since I definitely prefer some much easier to get IPAs."
"Right place right time. Randomly at the J Wakefield Brewery in Miami by the house just doing a flight of some of their delicious offerings when a Heady Topper emerges from the back room. Apparently a friend of a friend dropped some off to the staff and I was lucky enough to snag a nip. Sharp is the word that comes to mind. If this IPA was a person it would be well dressed in an Armani suit. Clean and crisp, sessionable if you can come across enough of them. 8% feels like 4%. Excellente."
"Pours yellow, hazy with a very nice white foam head (I poured it to share it, even though it says it´s better from the can). Aroma is great, hoppy, citric, flowery, fruity, delicious. Taste is amazing, hops and malts are very well balanced and tasty. Amazing beer, getting one of these in Mexico is nearly impossible. Cheers"
"I finally got to try a whole can of this. Definitely an excellent beer and seemingly ahead of its time. The smell is a bit of pine, ripe mango, cooked pineapple. The taste follows with a bit of heat in the end. Nice moderate bitterness."
Exceptional beer!
"Heady is one of those beers that I heard nothing but hype about for years before I finally ever tried it. I can comfortably say that it's fantastic, and that it by no means lands anywhere in my personal top beers. Aroma is an orange grove. Flavor is a forest of zesty hops and fluffy citrus. Surprisingly, to me, drinking it from the can is better than pouring into a glass. A world-class beer that might have amazed me more if I had tasted it a long time ago."
"Big, bright, hop bomb. I've had it many times and each time I tend to feel the same way. It's not my favorite IPA (or even in the top 5 - I tend to lean more toward piney IPAs) but I do really enjoy the brightness and the fruit, especially in the nose."
"My cousin from Maine from Maine brought me home a can of this. Wow this is one of the smoothest IPAs ever had. Nice Pinny taste can taste the floral hops. One big plus, it comes in a can."
"Damn. Thus is quite a good ipa. It's hard to go in with an open mind. I, honestly, think that I was trying to under rate it to off set my inherent bias, but i kept going back for more and more. It is quite unique and delicious. Here goes:"
Don't want to be to technical with reviews so here goes MY take on this beer.
I don't know how a beer could be more perfect. 
"This is by far the best of the best. I've been looking for a beer to top this, but have yet to find it. I beleive all the hype, and know that this is worth making the trip. The BROS' review is an understatement, you must try this beer."
Poured from 16 oz can into snifter. No visible date but was told this was canned about 5 weeks ago. 
"so glad i tracked a can down. Orange looking with a very nice tropical fruit aroma. Taste was bitter up front, then into those subtle fruity tones with a dry finish, but it actually improved as it warmed and became very drinkable and enjoyable towards its end. Unfortunately for heady, there are now far better and more accessible Ipa's around (see Finback, LIC and other half).best beer in the world?no chance. Enjoyable though and glad i got to try it."
"I enjoyed this beer, not as much as I thought I was going to. Very hyped for what I thought was just a nice Double IPA. Was this beer the best DIPA 8 years ago, probably. Not anymore. So many great beers out there. "
"the beast. this ones really hard to review. smell is so complex, tropical here, piney there, fruity over there, citrusy under there. malt? what malt? taste is even more complex than the smell. just about every hop taste there is, all over a juicy fuzzy bed. this one is killer. need to get my hands on focal and more of this!"
L-Hazy naval orange flesh color. White fluffy head.
Appearance: Very light and cloudy. Straw colored murky beer with particles floating around.
Love this beer
"Cans shared at the Craft Beer Co., London, many thanks to Mike. This stuff is totally rad. Out of academic interest I poured a small amount into my glass to find that this liquid is cloudy, glowing gold with a small, white foam head. Otherwise, slammed it straight to my face. Heady as shit, big and resinous, though not too big, or abrasively bitter. Huge pine character, ridiculously well balanced. Full bodied with fine carbonation. Big sticky finish, moderate earth. Just outrageous stuff."
Best ipa I've ever had excellent beer
"Let me say that my usual preference is a West Coast IPA. However, it is really nice to be able to explore the complexities of the hops without all the fruit. The earthy pine taste really comes through. While complex, the taste is balanced and the inevitable blast of hoppiness is very pleasant."
Beer review number 1000. Lucked out getting this. Sometimes the stars align...drank half from the can and poured half into a snifter.
Did not drink from a can. Large tulip SARA glass.
I can't believe this finally happened. Snagged a partial can at The Site in Corning. Poured into a sample glass.
"The first few times I had Heady Topper, it was love at first, second, third, and fourth taste. Since then, I've become hyper-critical (but that often stems from boredom). The feel of the Heady is my favorite part, a creaminess with bite that just reminds you with every taste that you are taking in something of such high quality that you feel almost blasphemous drinking it out of a can. I'd prefer the look to be a shade darker (but really, who cares), and the taste has just a touch too much bite on the front end to cry 'perfection'. But perfection is an endless pursuit, and since Heady is probably the best beer I've ever had, it gets a 5 overall. I love it and hopefully always will."
"Had it out of a can at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury. Poured a little into a taster just to check out the look, cloudy and straw colored. A nice hoppy aroma, but more subtle, not a punch to the face like other doubles."
"The beer has lived up to the hype for me. It is a great drink all the way through the can. We are a community of samplers, and this one is atop the list. I don't have a bunch of foofy words and feelings about the hop and feel. It is a great beer and I would have it again and again."
"All right, got this as a Christmas present from my nephew and I am oh so grateful."
"Stunning beer. Cloudy pale gold with a nice white head and moderate sticky lacing. The nose is grapefruit and pine with a sweet aroma in the back. The taste is amazing. Medium body, sweetness, citrus fruit and bitter pine. Really great beer."
Enjoyed in a can like it says on the can so my look I just gave a 4.
Don't believe the hype. Is it a good Imperial IPA? Yes? Is it worth all the hullabalo no. Is it the best? Not even close. Honestly don't understand the big deal with this beer. There are many better imperial IPA's out there. I think it being hard to get adds to the mystique of it but honestly there are other Vermont beers that are just as good. Do I regret buying it? No because going to this store allowed me to select a bunch of other delicious choices.
"Pours a rich orange with a nice white finger of foam. Smell is layers of citrus and some pine. Taste is similar. Super medium feel with just the right carbonation. Dry, somewhat bitter finish that sticks around. Like many IPAs, this one seems to change a lot depending on its age. The first time I had it it was light yellow and kind of tart. I think this one hits the sweet spot, as it's pretty amazing. As the can says, not the biggest beer, but the way it puts it all together is artful."
good beer but overrated
"Had this sent from a friend up north and they did a number on the box which obviously gave me some questions to if it was altered or not....as soon as I opened the can the smell was amazing and I was excited to see what all the hype was about. Like so many say, a little hazy with a one finger head, amazing smell. Love the citrus flavor, too many IPAs go way to Malty for me. Love this brew, lives up to the hype!"
"I know! ""Drink From The Can!"" they say... but I HAD to pour a small amount to a sniffer :)"
"Pours cloudy and bright radiant gold with huge 3-finger head that eventually settles to 1. Sticky and bubbly lacing remains along the top and sides of the glass. (Yea, didn't drink from the can... but wanted to be able to look at it)."
"Bright golden color, 2 inches of clean white foam."
"A- Lightly cloudy, straw color. Thin white foamy head leaving little lacing."
I see why people go nuts for this beer. The smell hits ya but isn't too much. It moves like a fresh bit of flowers. Nice straw/golden color with a bit of haze. Very nice taste...crisp with a bit of bitterness and bite. It is one of the better beers I have ever had. Would certainly like to give it another go
"From the can. Wonderful complexity in the taste profile - so much citrus flavor and aroma (especially grapefruit) in the beginning, then the sweet/bitter hoppy taste as the sip goes down. When fresh, this, in my opinion, is the epitome of Double IPA VT. beers."
Super juicy. Great bitterness and citrus balance. Crisp and snappy. A little sharp through the end.
"Poured from can into spiegelau ipa glass. Nice 3 finger head which turns into a sea of foam. Nice lacing. Hazy yellow in appearance. Smells great, picking up pine and citrus. This beer is great, picking up pine and grapefruit on the taste. Nice malt in the beginning with a slight bitter finish. What lingers on my palate after taking a sip is the grapefruit. Not bad. I thank my daughter for rooming with someone on the East Coast and bringing this to me. Great beer, but sad that I don't have constant access to it"
"Most excellent, but more of an IPA than. Double."
"The beer that changed beer drinking for me. This is by far my favorite beer. Complex hop flavors that hit you over and over! I can't get enough of it! Every time I crack one open its like the gates of Heaven are opening for me, while simultaneously my scalp is exploding off the top of my head. Delicious!! Quite difficult to come by, luckily my Grandma lives in Vermont and is able to get a ""somewhat"" steady supply to me. Salud!!"
yum...what a fantastic beer that totally lives up to the hype! The first time I had it in the can at a bar and found the whole experience rather odd. I finally picked up a few more cans at a random line trade and had a chance to sit down and really enjoy what I consider to be one of the best beers in the world. 
One of my favorites
"Look: for the little bit that I did pour from the can, its hazy like the NE DIPAs, but its a little ugly"
"Received a four pack as a surprise from my wife as an early Valentine's Day present so my ratings might be a little eschewed going up as simply put, how could one not enjoy trying this beer when they opened up the fridge and saw a surprise waiting for them (on Super Bowl Sunday no less)? (I tried both from can and glass so my review is kind of a compare/contrast review of the two methods)"
"Yeah it's a great beer, but..."
"This beer lives up to the hype. I drank it from the can except for a small amount I poured into a Tumbler glass to check out the color and look etc. Straw yellow to gold, 1 finger of head with some lacing. A little carbonated looking. Smell was outstanding. Hops and citrus peel. Extra ripe mango, a little cannabis even. Taste was hoppy, spicy and a little bitter. Citrus and sweet very well balanced. Just outstanding. One of the best beers I have ever had. Mouthfeel was medium and the aftertaste is tart and bitter, in a good way. World class"
T-Epic pine. Forest floor. Fresh mountain water.
Pours deep gold with heavy haze. Almost reminds me of pineapple juice though a shade darker. 1 finger off white head is sticky and fairly dense. Leaves heavy lacing behind. 
finally got my hands on a 4 pack of this. pretty much lived up to my expectations. very well made beer. great smell when I opened the can. good color and great taste.
"Flowery aroma, smooth finish, mild hoppy taste, well-rounded"
"Look: hazy, pillowy head (poured into spieglau for sharing)"
A 1 pint can canned on 15th December 2015 (I would have drank it earlier but was very sick for a long period of time) and tried from the can at first then poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"My ""Gold Standard""."
Believe the hype. Heady Topper is the real deal.
"A - okay, so from the can I'd give this a 5, the can is cool as hell. Also if I was thinking about the dank, pure, no censorship nature of this beer I'd give it a 5 too. But for fairness sake, it is a murky yellow/gold color with a nice white head that sticks and leaves decent lacing. If any other beer looked like this id knock it for the look but this one it's just so fitting. "
"I received two cans via trade. I was disappointed, perhaps the cans were old but don't know because they're not dated."
"Worth all of the hype as it is my favorite beer I've had thus far. As many have said, I wish they actually distributed their product."
"I gave ""look"" 5 cause I love the can haha. I've never poured it out of the can, therefore have never seen it :)"
"This beer changed DIPAs for me. Its Juicy, dank, and has the perfect amount of bitterness to balance out the malt profile. The 8% is well disguised behind layer after layer of tropical aroma and flavor. I definitely prefer the ""drink it from the can"" philosophy. Although I love the hop flavor, I find it unappealing to see the particulate floating in the glass."
"This is the beer that started it all for me. First hoppy beer I ever had where I was just blown away by the taste. It is a great beer and I always try to share it with people to see if they will like it. Great beer to get someone into craft beer with if you can find it. Luckily I'm in the North east and have some access to it. Love this beer my all time classic double IPA, hop bomb!"
Luckily I was able to get 1. Believe the hype. This American IIPA is arguably the best overall in its class. 
"This is one of my favorite beers since I most recently started drinking them. I've drunk about 8 of them in the past 5 months. I recommend this beer, it is the best NE IPA in the world."
"Gold color, massive amounts of sediment throughout it, not turbidity, but rather a decent beer with chunks, rather than finer particulates uniformly dispersed throughout the beer. "
"Well worth the wait, being aself decribed non-IPA this was very drinkable beer. "
A- poured really hazy with a decent white head. Really hazy
"This beer changed my life. I used to just drink beer. Now I experience beer. First time I had this it was like an explosion of hop flavor went off in my mouth. I poured it into a glass contrary to the instructions on the can. Flavors were like nothing I had ever experienced. Such complex citrus, pine and malt flavors combined to produce a brew that is truly life changing."
In can
"With such hype and such high expectations, it seems inherent to grade this DIPA more critically and harsher than others. Even in doing so, this is an absolute one of a kind brew and the definition of a world class, perfectly balanced, hop explosion. An unreal drink. From aroma to taste to feel, it is truly unique and incredible. I am trying to compare it to pliny (elder) because I drink it so often and it has been my undisputed favorite imperial, but this is just so different that there is no way to compare. Both are as good as it gets and I cant wait to include Heady as a regular brew to mix up my usual pliny evenings. If you havnt had Heady, you need to."
A: Hazy cloudy golden yellow with foamy white head. I only poured a small amount out since its meant to drank right from the can
Part of my Pliny vs Heady session
Absolutely delightful double IPA. Consumed directly from the can about two weeks old (unconfirmed). The blast of hops in the mouthfeel after a fantastic nose was just unreal.
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely amazing DIPA style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A insanely delicious offering."
"After hearing all the hype surrounding this one I finally got my hands on a case (less than a week old). Upon first opening the can I was immediately drawn in by the juicy aroma, after tasting I felt a little bit let down as in my mind THIS was THE BEER to try! The typical IPA notes are all there and in fact this was far smoother than most I have tried. In closing it's a great VT beer and definitely in my top 10 but is it the end all of beers? I don't think so."
The best beer in the world.
The best IPA that i've had. Period. Citrus and pine accompany the hops. A very serious but not distracting malt backbone results in the most balanced ipa i've had. Perfect.
"Bought two cases up in Burlington, Vermont. The best IPA I've ever had. I prefer the taste of IPAs because of their huge flavor and hoppiness. One thing I'll tell you, you don't get the after taste of typical IPAs. You can drink this 8.0 ABV as a session beer.... You'll be passed out of you drink t as a session beer though. The unpasteurized canning feels like it's more potent than typical IPAs. I love it. Don't miss this one. Take the trip to Vermont."
"Good beer not sayung anything bad about it, but to be ranked #5 its really overrated"
"This is the beer that got me into hops. Honestly was under the belief that all IPAs were supposed to be so bitter and gross. It made me realize that I just had bad hoppy beers before. This is a Hop aroma bomb, this its got great balance between the massive hoppiness and malt backbone with little to no hope bitterness."
I've had Heady Topper from the Alchemist a few times and it is truly a great IPA. It says to drink from the can and I've done that. The aroma might be a little better if you drink from the can but I still prefer a snifter.
"Always been an IPA fan. Amazing taste till the last drop in the can. Some IPAs tend to be too hoppy or bitter, but this one has the perfect balance. Listen to the words on the can and drink it straight out of the can. Really seals in the flavor. Made my Christmas in Vermont with or without the snow."
Love this brew every time I have one I need another to satisfy the craving!
"I had the priviledge to enjoy this all the way in Canada over Christmas. In brief, the beer was good, great even. But ... wait for it ... Pliny the Elder fresh from the source is THE #1 DIPA for me. Meaning if I choose between one or the other - Pliny!!"
Massive thanks to Brandonhelvie for hooking me up with this long-time want! Time to pop that cherry now!
Sets the standard for IPAs
The overall taste and aroma from this beer is outstanding.
A great IPA to learn to appreciate others.
"Bottle share (or can share) from redBeard. Beautiful aroma, heady indeed. Nice robust, slick body, hoppy notes dominate without distracting. Clean finish."
"This was one of my favorite beers. I've only had one so far. Wish I could get them in cali. I had some from proper glassware and some from the can. Both amazing flavors, completely different tastes. I am in beer love!"
"Straight from the can I get lots of hoppy aroma; citrus, grapefruit, some mango, and pine/resin. Taste is grapefruit with lots of slick resiny pine. Finish has a bit of alcohol but not out of line for the style. The slick hops knock down the body a bit but I'd still call it medium, moderate carbonation. "
"This is an excellent IPA, and I'm acutely aware of its cult like status among beer aficionados - amplified because it's only available during a harvest moon of a leap year and only in Vermont (I kid... mostly). It is not the best I've ever had. It's missing what I really appreciate from an IPA, which is bright and complex flavors. It's well balanced, but that makes the fruit notes muted. It's also loaded with hop resin which makes it rather unattractive (they tell you to drink it from the can). As much as I love this, I would recommend ""Sip of Sunshine,"" by Lawson's Finest Liquids instead."
"I tried this from the can first and then poured a second can into a pint glass in order to rate look. Got one finger of short-lived head but with lacing. Color was golden orange and murky, due to unfiltered nature. Actually looks much better than some would lead you to assume. Aroma from can was stronger compared to the glass; hops are giving me citrus, grapefruit, and pine notes. Taste matches to perfection - I would call this a great juicy IPA. Nice, subdued bitterness on finish. Feel is definitely medium; a bit more body than many of the style. Nice carbonation. Overall, this one lives up to the hype."
"Still really enjoy this piece of heaven, however the one I had on Christmas was not nearly as good as the first one , your first is always the best. thanks to family living in Burlington, can get it pretty regularly and fresh."
Poured from a can into a Chimay tuip.
"My favorite DIPA of all time! I did not even know it existed until someone gave it to me for my 30th birthday, and then had it many more times on a vacation in Vermont. The way it tastes and the bitterness are just amazing."
"The only reason I gave no perfect score is because the beer looks a bit cloudy. That's why it says to drink it from the can on the label. However, the hoppy smell and taste are one that has you saying ""that's good"" after the first sip. Then you have another sip and another and just keeps getting better. Delicious."
Truly outstanding
A: cloudy; orangish gold in color; 2 finger ivory head that receded to a splotchy cap; nice lacing;
"Loved everything about this beauty besides the fact that it is not readily available in south Florida, or at least the last time I checked. I knew there was something exceptional about this slice of heaven because I basically asked for it in code and it was retrieved from the back as if we were back in the 20's in an undisclosed speakeasy. Maybe the rarity of this beer in south Florida warrants this hush hush conduct. Drank straight from the can so unable to see, smelled of hops, citrus perfect hops, tasted like more. I definitely did not get my fill of Heady Topper although some might argue my thirst is never quenched. Overall I loved it and it was perfect for me. Would not change a damn thing."
"Finally got to try this over the holiday from a friend of a friend and drank from the can, as instructed. By far one of the best DIPA I have gotten the pleasure to try. Hoppy, Citrusry... maybe I'm weird because I think the difference between this beer and say, Nightshift Santilli is not large, but I rate both extremely extremely highly."
Finally got a chance to try this (Thanks Will and Ian at Grapes and Gourmet for the sweet trade).
"Drank it both ways. From the can and in a glass (aroma is a big part my drinking experience and I was happy drinking from the glass. No surprise to the hype and cult iconic character. Well deserved. Did head to head with MBC Dinner, BB Swish and Foundation Epiphany. Personally I felt that Heady was a tad more on the bitter aspect. Nonetheless a solid solid DIPA."
Loved it
"Ok. Here I go. Got this from beerme330, big ups dude. Thank you. Drank it from the can other than a small amount poured to get a look at it. Looks like a floaty filled home brew. Smell was hops, tho they didn't eminate from the can as other have stated. Taste was quite hoppy with a bit of bitterness but it had an overwhelming booziness to it I didn't expect for 8%. Some citrus and tropical fruits present, but not nearly the life altering menagerie of lupulin I expected/hoped for. "
Simply put....delish.
Drank from the can as instructed on the can.
I'm afraid the good reviews this beer gets are mostly historical. It's hard to find and just a little unimaginative for 2015 IPAs
Is this the greatest beer or WHAT! Love this beer!!!
"This was the best hoppy beer I ever tried, UNTIL I tried Tree House's hoppy beers."
Drank from the can as suggested. Poured a bit into a snifter just to see the beautiful orange color and there were definite floaters in there. Smelled incredible. A multitude of citrus notes with grapefruit seemingly the strongest. Tasted lighter than other DIPAS recently and got more piney notes as the beer warmed. Overall lived up to the hype
"so this is it.....been looking for you for some time, almost had you but missed by inches. look was the yellow unfiltered look that the better IPA's possess, must admit I put some in a glass just to savor the look and feel. smell was exquisite and with loads of citrus and hops, taste was a differentiator and had the heady topper flavor all to itself (just what i had waited for) flavor was long - sophisticated and real, w hops and citrus and the feel was silky and smooth, did not feel or taste the Double IPA or alcohol level. just pure goodness, hope to see you again!"
16 ounce can poured into a tulip glass 
This isn't the first time I've had this but continues to remind me why I come back for more. Not my favorite DIPA but always a classic.
"I've bought into the hype full on. At first, I wasn't sure this was a perfect IPA, but after a case...and a year later, I'm sold. The grassy, dank hops wave that blasts you in the face with each sip, damn...just perfect."
Got one as a gift. Opened it to celebrate my Patriots winning the Super Bowl. It was worthy of the occasion.
It's good to be King!
"Pours a light gold, very hazy, medium head with lots of tiny bubbles. Aroma is rich with mint, ripe pear, some mixture of citrus, light pine, faint hint of earthiness. Interesting bitterness taste, light up front, then hits you a bit, then fades and lingers. Definitely a ""juicy"" VT IPA."
thanks to the beer advocate trading community...i've had this on several occasions! The nose on this beer is incredibly citrus & juicy and the taste does not disappoint. No aftertaste. Just a wonderfully crafted IPA.
"L - Kate Upton in a glass. In other words, a 20-something babe who's voluptuous and will never look this good again. Yet, here's the difference: Heady Topper will always look this good because Alchemist has gone to great lengths to perfect this beer. Super turbid, excellent head retention and brilliant variations of orange when held to the light. Only poured to extract a true interpretation of the look. This isn't my first dance with Heady. Drink from the can!"
"Probably the best smelling IPA I have ever come across. Comparing to Pliny the Elder, Heady is more ""In your Face"". The taste is bold and the Hops hit you all at once. Its almost an overload, but that's a good thing. Do drink it from the can as it tells you. This deserves its spot amongst the best."
I have never had a better IPA.
"Fortunate enough to have this at Hunahpu day '15. I'm not at all fond of IPA's in general, opposite of a hop head. But this one delivers! Fantastic fresh citrusy hop aroma! Taste follows aroma, very bright, fresh hop flavor, with substantial but not overwhelming bitterness. Drinks light for an 8%. A phenomenal example of the style."
Consumed out the can 
16oz can into pint glass. 
"This brew is as good as everyone says it is. On a recent trip to Burlington, VT I spent a good hour in hopes of finding some. I was able to score a 4pack in store and a single can with dinner on Church Street. This beer is the standard which all other IPA's are judged against nowadays, and with good reason."
"Easy to see why this is the world's best IPA. Crisp, super hoppy, citrus and pine notes make for an interesting flavor profile. The aroma is out of this world. Traveling to Vermont for this beer makes for a truly unique experience. A must for any beer lover"
Perfection.
CAN
"Aroma: pineapple, citrus, pine, little bit of onion"
Top class. Time definitely changes the flavor profile. I prefer it fresher. The beautiful aroma always punches you in the nose when first opening.
If you can ever get your hands on one. Enjoy it. Cause they are so hard to find. Roumor has it people have sold one can of that wonderful bliss in DC for around $50. That's crazy. But I've payed $9-10 for one.
"Great smell and color, a must try for all beer enthusiasts. It says to drink out of the can, but i prefer in a glass."
"Truly world class. Super complex but so well balanced. Nothing overpowering. Citrus, grass, a little herbal, a little zing. Amazing."
"Very delicious beer, procured a can from a nice fellow I met while in Bruges, Belgium. All I can say is we need this in western Canada!"
Hard to live up to the hype but this was phenomenal. So glad I have 7 more. Flavor delivers with every sip. Smell is phenomenal.
Great beer
"With respect to John Kimmich, most of the time, I have drank this out of the can. However, for reviewing purposes, one must understand that as beer geeks we need to see this as it is."
The thing that makes this beer so prefect is the lack of imperfections. There is nothing wrong with it on any way and always a delight to have
"This beer is the best I have had the few times I have been (legally) drinking. After pouring a can (which I know you're not supposed to do), I believe that IT IS TRULY BETTER FROM THE CAN! This beer OUT OF CAN appearance is amber in color and slightly cloudy (similar to a micro-brew high ABV cider). However In the can it's one of the best IPA locally produced. "
"Drank from the can, smells very citrusy, has a hazy yellow color, tastes of citrus with a great malt balance. Excellent imperial pale ale would certainly recommend this if you love DIPA. "
"This was one of the best beers I have ever had and undoubtedly the best IPA. Very well balanced and complex the smell is much more different than the taste. The citrus and hop flavor cascades over your tongue and down your throat wonderfully, and has an indescribable complex flavor. Truely a beer lovers beer"
The best - bar none! This IPA lived up to its legend and exceeded my expectations. I would not have words to do it true justice. Also to note that I enjoyed this beer most when drinking it from the can for a little more of a fresh and piney hop quality.
"This beer is truly flawless. Unfortunately, I now compare every IPA/DIPA to this and none can replace it (although I've yet to try Focal Banger). I like it better than SOS, Pliny, Julius, Zombie Dust as well as any other beer I've ever had (although SOS is a close second). I'm not going to get technical on every aspect since there are plenty of those types of reviews. I will say that this beer smells amazing, has a fruity taste (grapefruity) and goes down smooth. I almost wish I never tasted this because now I am going obsess over acquiring as much as possible. Good luck! Cheers."
"Hand-picked from a market in Waterbury, VT I highly recommend this beer. Flying from CA to VT for a day to pick up fresh cans instead of trading for them is highly-recommended no matter the expense. Treat yourself to the experience."
All that and a bag of chips...
"Just got around to trying this beer from The Alchemist and it definitely lived up to its hype. Unfortunately I only had one during a bottle share but i hope to get my hands on more. I first poured a little to try it in a tulip but left some to compare because on the can it literally states in bold ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" and it honestly tasted way better from the can. "
Oh so close... Yet so far away. I miss it when I run out. One of the only beers I go out of my way for...
Not over hyped at all. And not my first time having this beer. I love it.
Finally got my hands on 4 cans. Thanks Mike and Mary. 
"Appearance - Nice golden orange color, good lacing, but has the clarity of Yak Wool. "
"Canning date unknown, but purchased on October 23rd, presumably from the 10/22 delivery day."
Just beautiful. Tasty with a PERFECT finish. How do they do that?
"Best beer ive ever drank,and was also a cool experience buying it up in Vermont waiting in line with 60 people at a gas station before the beer truck even showed up. Love everything about this beer, hoping to get a 1/6th keg for the kegerator!!"
"First time pouring it from the can. A very hazy, bright, golden yellow body with a snowy white head. The hops make themselves known the moment you crack the can. Lot of ripe citrus, lemon zest, tropical fruits, papaya, mango, a hint of melon, peach, and pine resin. There's an excellent underlying sweet maltiness to this beer that I suspect is partially thanks to the conan yeast strain. The mouth feel is very cream, medium-full, washed down by nice carbonation, followed by a pleasant sweet tropical lemon aftertaste. On the flavor, sweet lime, grapefruit bitterness, lemon candy, peach, pine sap, some grass, papaya, honey malt, and melon. "
"From the can, at the beerlin beer week. Wonderfull and powerfull hop aroma, Peach, papaya and ananas, little caramel, some dank nessuno presence and a little bit of Pine needless. Complex, sweet bready mlt with ananas, stone fruit, some citrus and piney. Imbelievable, wonderfull beer."
"pours a hazy yellow and the smell jumps right out. Drinks so amazingly smooth, really glad i had a chance to try this!"
Best beer I've ever had.
"It is great to have kids who live in Burlington VT, and take care of their Dads. I can never decide if I like this or SOS better. What a great beer!"
"Got this one from De Hopduvel in Ghent, BE. The next one I will drink from the can, but this one I had to dissect. No idea how fresh it is."
"The beer has a hazy orange color. The aroma is tropical fruits, resin, and light malt. The taste is creamy, medium bitterness, light malt, tropical fruits, and resin."
"Smells about the best ever! Full of flower notes. Super bitter, at first I thought it was kind of thin, but turns out it's complex as hell and moves around."
"Just barely beats out the Elder Pliny for both aroma/bouquet and overall taste... I loved both but head2head, I would choose the Heady over the Pliny. They were so close (different tastes and complexities of pretty equal yum) that in my uneducated mind all I could think was that the water used by Heady made the difference in the end... might be wrong but seemed logical at the time."
"Just got back from vacation and still had some Heady that I could review. Even as someone who lives close to the Heady delivery locations, this is unnecessarily difficult to get a hold of. Certainly a great beer, but I would recommend any of those dishearted to find this sold out to seek Lawson's Sip of Sunshine. It's just as good imho but much more available."
"Fresh Heady is amazing. Older Heady is better than no Heady, although it does drop off a bit as it sits around. Still a very sought after and highly drinkable DIPA. One of my favorites!"
"Exceptional double IPA. No debate, no discussion. This is not a review which argues that this beer is over hyped. I think Alchemist are doing it the way it should be done. Make an excellent product, sell it locally and don't expand. "
Best hands down
Lives up to the hype. Best Ipa ive ever had. Made a pilmrigage to vermont to track this down and came home with two cases. may need to go to Vermont every year. This beer is so juicy and so floral. The hop profile and flavors change throughout the drink and throughout the life of the beer. Every can pleased in a different way.
"After trying this beer I understand the hype. From the moment I started drinking it I could not stop taking sips. It tasted like a hop milkshake. So creamy and delicious, each sip built upon the previous with loads of grassy, piney, and tropical flavor bursts balanced perfectly with an amazing yeast/malt backbone. Poured half into my Spiegelau IPA glass and drank the other half from the can. This beer is heavenly. It is the most well balanced beer I've ever had. Well done Alchemist!"
Lives up to the hype. Thank heavens for this beer and the alchemist brewers. The only part of the beer that I felt didn't live up to the IIPA standard of greatness for me was the aroma. It was beautiful - but it was not as much of an explosion as Pliny or SoS. Otherwise - truly an experience of a beer.
"Maybe the best beer I have tasted. I had heard the hype and seen the rating. If you go to Vermont, you need to check out a local store and find out when their deliveries are. I was fortunate enough to score a case at a great spot on Route 7. Smooth, beautifully hopped, lightly malted, magnificently balanced, slightly sweet. Do drink it in the can. I resisted and tried a little bit in a glass first. It is better in the can. the Alchemist has mastered the ability to put a World Class Beer in a can. I'm enjoying one a night until they are gone and I look forward to another trip to Vermont. I will share with only my BEST friends."
"I consider myself a relative newcomer to the world of craft beer, having gotten into it rather late in life. However, I consider myself a quick learner. I have been rating and reviewing beers on BA for a little more than a year now. I feel that day by day I'm acquiring more beer tasting experience and that my reviews are getting better. As a result of an increasingly discerning and sophisticated palate, I find that my reviews while mostly positive, are becoming less effusive in praise. This past spring, my father, after a trip from San Francisco, brought me at my request a few bottles of Pliny the Elder. Long story short, I thought it was quite possibly the tastiest and most perfectly balanced IPA I had ever had. I had no choice but to give it a perfect 5."
"I have had this a couple times now....always fresh within 7 to 10 days from VT to my mouth. I did a blind tasting with heady, pliny the elder and sip of sunshine and heady and pliny were the top performers. All very strong beers....I have then done straight out of the can and as weird as it sounds it does add something. Are pliny or heady worth the effort.....if you love hops, and you want the experience....100% yes. If you love beer I think experiencing beers from those who love what you do is key....and The Alchemist love beer and what they do."
This is a great IPA for sure. Lots of pine and citrus up front. Smooth finish with nice balanced hops. Alcohol does get more pronounced after a few sips.
Thanks to Craig for giving my one of these. Check this one off the list. I was sharing this with my neighbor so it was not consumed from the can per the directions.
"This was for sure the best IPA I have ever had. Better than Pliny from the first sip to the last. Clean smell and taste, perfect balance. Carbonation was spot on. If you can get this, get it."
"Description: Golden slightly cloudy color with a white head and lacing. Aroma was a strong floral smell with some citrus, especially orange. Taste was similar with floral and citrus up front. There is some nice hoppy bitterness on the finish but it's not a hopbomb and is very well balanced. I thought I detected some earthy/umami flavors as well but they were pretty masked. The alcohol is present but like the bitterness is not overwhelming. Carbonation is light to medium."
"Hazy orange color, light fruity smell, very drinkable with a smooth feel. Although the can says ""drink from can"", it's basically the same poured into a glass. Overall this really was a good beer but not the one of the best on the East Coast in my opinion. They really need to start dating their cans to ensure that they are drank in a timely fashion."
"Very nice IPA, I enjoyed this more once I poured the last 1/4 into a glass, I'm going to try the next one in a glass from the get go. Heady had a very nice to it, the smell was not something I picked up well from the can, the taste seemed to be a little citrus with a very small bitter note from the can but was quite drinkable. Once it was in the glass it lost the very mild bitter taste I picked up and became a dipa I could crush!"
"Excellent beer. Recommened to drink out of the can instead pouring into a bottle. Wonderful fruity aroma and delicious hoppy tasta. The great think about this IPA is that it lacks the bitterness that non-hopheads hate. Overall, a great drink and one that is worth the hype."
Nearly perfect. This beautiful IPA actually lived up to the hype. Sampled two cans-- one straight from the can and one in a glass (to view). I can confirm that drinking it straight from the can is better... but just slightly. The smoothness and citrus fruit shines through beyond all else. Loved it.
"Pours a light cloudy orange with adequate frothy white head. Aroma of tropical fruit, pine, slight floral and herbal, pineapple, mango and melon with tropical fruit esters (pear/peach)from the yeast. Flavor matches the aroma and add a very slight malty sweetness that is just enough to play off of the perfect amount of bitterness in this beer. A touch of wheat also. Mouthfeel is light but with a slightly creamy fruit juice feel to it... Overall awesome DIPA."
Heaven in a can.
no copy cat will do
"Being raised in VT I had to give this a try albeit on accident. I drank it from the can therefore I could not see the beer but I am assuming it looks the part. I have never have been an IPA fan but the nose was dank, dank, pine and resin. The taste was not like anything I had tasted before, I assume people like the taste and this beer but it was a drain pour for me. Thankfully I had a friend that wanted and could not find it to buy and was very happy to get the remainder as a gift. I appreciate all different types of beer but I could not drink this. Judging from its reviews it is very popular and well liked I just could not get behind this."
L-A hazy golden peach color with a full inch of white fluffy head. Lacing clings to the sides in layers as I drink.
One of the best Imperial IPA's period.
"I drove ten hours from Toronto to Vermont, some of which was spent in total darkness through torrential rain, partly, just to try this beer. Once I arrived at the White Horse Inn in Waitsfield, I had my first taste."
"Tough to really add much that hasn't been said many times already below, but here goes. Poured out just a tiny bit to see what it looks like but otherwise almost every time I have drank it from the can as they emphasize. Delicious and great double IPA, with citrusy, piney hop taste. However, what many reviews fail to mention is that in my experience, Heady produces multiple waves of flavor that continue even after you have swallowed the beer. I guess the can says something about ""wave after wave of hoppy goodness"" and in my experience this isn't just marketing hype. That really is how it tastes, and the multiple waves of flavor is not something I have experienced with almost any other beer. Very interesting and my favorite part about this beer. Overall it's fantastic and definitely worth seeking out. However, it is NOT worth the degree of crazed hype associated with it. I can think of a dozen hoppy beers I have had this year that I'd rather have over Heady. In fact, it's not even the best DIPA made by the brewery (Focal Banger is outstanding). That doesn't mean I don't say yes any time very fresh Heady is offered to me as part of a trade...you should definitely try it at least once."
Had part out of the can and the rest in a glass. I prefer it out of a glass.
amazing! Don't really know what i was expecting when my brother in law presented this after several days of anticipation but i can say it was worth the wait. Possibly the best ipa/dipa i have ever sampled! Seriously contemplating the 3.5 hr drive+ 1hr wait in line for a case of this...
Love me some topper! excellent beer!
"One of my favorites. Just wish I could still get a cone of fries at The Alchemist, too."
"The hype is real. Took a few days to get used to the taste, but this is by far the best beer I've ever had. Tastes hoppy with a hint of pine. Perfect for a summer on Lake Champlain."
One of my all time favorites. I love this thing I drank this from the can. Fantastic beverage can't find too much that even taste like it but there are some that try. Hands down the best!!!
"Look: Poured into a glass, despite the suggestion of drinking from the can. (I was sharing it with two other people). A hazy yellow color with LOTS of fluffy head which lingers and leaves a nice lacing."
"The hype is real. Pine, grapefruit, earth, citrus zest all compete in a no holds bar cage fight in your mouth were the only winner is you. Like a synchronize swim team every flavor plays its roll and comes together in harmonious crescendo that leaves angels agape of the marvels they witness. Dry finish yet creamy mouthfeel. Hop bitterness to an extreme that somehow is as smooth as a freshly waxed Lamborghini. This beer is the quintessential definition of polar opposite. I don't care how it's done. Just keep doing it."
"No hype here as this is the real deal. My can was gifted from a regular trading buddy, so no clue of age. The small bit I poured had a straw yellow body with a touch of hazy. A bit more head would have been nice. The nose is best in class - straight citrus hop pine resin goodness. Perfect. The flavors match the nose with peppery grapefruit, grass, and hop resins with a perfectly planned background sweetness to manage some of the bitterness. Mouth feel is fresh, super peppery, and well carbonated. It meets the hype."
I don't know what the big talk was about this IPA. I finally found it in Vermont after a lot of searching but was not delighted with the taste.
"Tasted was Greatness. The after taste is literally thirst quenching, by far the best IPA ive ever had, and to top it off its a double IPA, Smell is floral with a solid hop aroma."
"Look - poured a little out to get look, then drank rest from can as instructed by the can. Pours a hazy orange."
"Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange with a big fluffy, ""heady"", white two finger head that has some great sticky staying power. Big aroma notes of orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and barky pine dance with that beautifully subtle, yet distinct Vermont yeast. Take a sip and perfectly soft, medium mouthfeel bring wave after wave of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine along with a touch of dank grassiness and a nice, gentle malt sweetness. It's so balanced. So intense, yet so delicate. The bitterness is there in amount enough to just perfectly support everything else that's going on. It lives up to the hype. So good."
Gets better as you drink it.
"Poured into a Duvel glass. The hype is real. Wish this was more readily available, but then again, good things are best enjoyed every once in awhile. What is in the water in Vermont ......."
"Possibly the only IPA I have ever truly enjoyed. They are not for me, but it is undeniable that Heady Topper is beautiful."
"The first one, it was truly worth my wait. Taste is superb."
"This beer isn't perfect, but it's damn near perfect. Smell is dank and tropical, but the taste is just remarkably better. Sweet mango, tropical fruits, followed by a pine dankness that's just amazing. A lingering amazing darkness that I've never really tasted like this before. The mouth feel is creamy and full, yet extremely drinkable still."
Very anxious to try this. Been trying to trade for it all summer. Canned Sept.7th
16oz can
"Pours an opaque straw color. Looks like grapefruit/pineapple juice. Big aroma of citrus and tropical fruit with slight addition of fresh cut grass. Taste is grapefruit, pineapple, mango, grape, and dank hops. Its not too sweet or too bitter. The bite from the hops is just enough to balance the juicy fruit flavor. Mouth feel is medium and very creamy with a dry finish. Definitely lived up to the hype. A very well crafted beer."
16 oz recent can release.
Drank from can. 
"Smells of pineapple, mild pine and mango rind. Tastes very similar to the aroma. Piney, bitter, resiny, no malt sweetness. Mouth feel was crisp, clean, light and smooth. Good stuff! Very dank. Bitter and resiny finish. I'm not going to say that this is the best DIPA in the market, as some would say, but it is very good. I'm glad to have tried it. Definitely buy it if you find it but don't go crazy looking for it or pay more than $10 for a can. CHEERS! "
"Firsttime reviewing heady! its more of a stupid list of simple opinions/ facts, cause like, its all been said. Here we go..."
"Received in a trade, poured half into a tulip and drank the other half straight from the can. Hazy gold/amber. Sweet juicy hop aroma. Very well balanced, just enough malt to really showcase the hops. The mouthfeel is better than any other ipa/dipa I've ever had! Lives up to the hype."
"Worth the trip! Enjoyed right from the can, perfectly balanced, prefer hop forward bitter iipa, this is the joe college of iipa style. It's really really good."
"Drank straight from the can. Pleasant hop aroma. Dank grassy flavors, creamy mouthfeel. Finish is slightly earthy. There is a touch of smoke in there as well. Overall, this is a tried and trued DIPA."
"pours out a hazy golden orange with bright white head that leaves some nice lacing. aromas of herbs and pine, bubblegum, honey, apricots & peach, orange, grapefruit, grassy hops. on palate is peach, orange, grapefruit, honey soaked mango, sweet bready malts, gummy sweetness, matched by resinous pine, earthy dankness and green herbal notes. mouthfeel is medium bodied with some nice fluff. "
Broke the rules and poured it out of the can into a chalice. This beer was canned three weeks ago.
A beautiful beer with subtle citrus notes. Smooth and easy drinking. Hops are solid but not overpowering. One could sit and drink a lot of this in one sitting.
"This looked a bit more viscous than most IPA's. It smelled light, and refreshing, with the slightest amount of citrus, to intrigue. The taste was far more full than I had anticipated, with what seemed like many hop varieties joining together to make for a wonderful experience. The best part for me was the mouthfeel, as I think it had almost a nitro smoothness, as it was creamy and heavy. Overall, I wish I had more than three cans..!"
I wanted to love this beer considering everyone else does but unfortunately I did not. I drank it from the can as it suggests and I think it suffered from not being poured. I'm willing to try it again.
"Best IPA I've tried to date. Great beer, wish I could find it on the west coast."
Finally! 
"Poured a little into a glass and color is a cloudy golden orange. Deep hop aroma, lots of pine, resin & citrus. I drank the rest from the can. Flavor is huge resin and pine. You get citrus, a touch of sweetness. The flavor continues to develop with a bubbly crispness. The finish is smooth and leaves a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. This beer is definitely better out of the can and overall I can't find any issue. This is a perfect beer. Maybe not the best I've ever had but still a perfect beer"
"This is the real deal. Best IPA in the country hands down IMHO . New England births the best, especially Northern VT."
"Brother brought home a few cans for Thanksgiving when he was a student at UVM. He said it was the best double IPA he had ever had. I was intrigued. The admonition to drink it from the can is one that should be heeded for the best experience of the brew, To pour it into a glass would be a discredit. For one thing, the beer is unfiltered. By pouring it onto a glass, you would see all the detritus from the hops and yeast floating around. if poured from the can into a glass, you also lose the best way to experience all the aromatic hops. Do yourself a solid, and drink it from the can. "
"They manage to shove an EXTREME amount of hoppy flavor without the aftertaste of licking a bail of hay that most extreme IPA's give. It is good, but I just can't force myself to join the extreme IPA crowd. If that is your thing, drink this beer."
This is the best IPA ive ever had the pleasure of drinking. Has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. Really surprised I have yet to rate it until now.
"I was lucky enough to get some Heady Topper last week on a trip up to VT. I stood in line for two hours total at a couple of different places in Burlington and ended up with a little over a case, it was completely worth the wait. It is the most drinkable IPA I've ever tasted, very smooth, and as the can says it leaves you with ""wave after wave of hoppy goodness!"" Not to mention at 8% ABV one or two of these bad boys will leave feeling nice and hopped up. I only wish they would make more so more people could try this amazing beer!"
"Not perfect, but the most drinkable DIPA I've had. Beautiful beer with a huge aroma that fills a room, the taste does not quite follow the aroma (which may make it more drinkable) and the feel is a bit thinner than I'd like for a DIPA (also, making it more drinkable). Could crush these all day if Vermonter's weren't so selfish!"
had a friend of a friend ship a few cans of heady out to chicago. 
"I was lucky enough to have this in the same flight as Pliny the Younger. It held up too. Nice taste and nose, but after a long day of tasting, I couldn't quite put my finger on the aftertaste that I was getting. I think it was the combo of pine and orange."
"Wow lives up to the hype, just a delicious beer straight from the can, doesn't get better had this fresh like 3 days fresh and honestly I can see how this beer redefines DIPA's there is nothing else like this."
"Finally, getting to try the legendary Heady Topper. Sent to me by BigStein here on BA. Thanks!"
"Absolutely amazing...up until now Pliny the Elder was my fave ever...recently a friend and his wife were passing thru Vermont at the right time and I got 36 of these bad boys...opened my first yesterday...just a beautiful beverage. Hoppy, smooth and with an incredible nose, lots of pine and nice lingering hoppy flavour with just a touch of bitterness out the back. I followed the rules and drank from the can...but the next one will be in a glass..."
Still the best IPA out there. It is the all IPA's are judged against and for a good reason.
"Great beer. Shame its so hard to get. Aroma is fruity with resin and pine goodness. The flavor is more pine to me and I think the label is spot on here with....""dense hoppy finish in your mouth. I think that dense and oily mouth feel is the best I've ever had! One of the smoothest and easy drinking IPAs I've had. I'm drinking this side by side with Todd the Axeman and I'm not ashamed to say I prefer the aroma and taste of Todd but the feel of Heady a bit more. I wouldn't turn down either tho."
"gold standard for any beer. Excellent hoppy characteristic, perfectly balanced, perfect taste and feel. This beer changed by drinking preference from Scotch/wine to beer"
"Such an amazing beer! It's so hard for a beer like this to stand up to the hype, but it does."
Glad I was able to enjoy this great beer. Pours great and has a wonderful cloudy orange color. Has a nice juicy pop up front with a smooth creamy finish. Can't wait to get it again.
"Made the trip up to VT to snag a case of this, and it was worth the drive time. I understand how this beer has stayed on the top of the charts for so long. Great orange color, with citrus not only in the smell but throughout the taste. Definitely a world-class beer"
Sublime. .
A beer well worth the pursuit
"Had this a few times, solid brew but a little bit inconsistent (tasted slightly different each time). Would love to go up to VT and get it fresh within hours of it being canned (most of what my beer group brings down to PA is around a week old."
"The myth, the legend, the Heady Topper. Finally got to try some and I can see the mass appeal."
"I have had this beer too many times to count, and it never fails to disappoint. To consistently brew something this flavorful is crazy. The beer is hazy golden, with nary a floatie in it. The taste explodes with tropical and citrus, but enough hop bitterness to keep it from being a juice bomb. A fantastic beer that everyone should try at least once."
Floral burst as soon as you open the can. Piney taste is forward. A youch of citrus follows. Slo-fade bitterness through the finish. It is a classic that is consistent from can to can.
"A- straw nyellow, hints of gold "
"Delicious beer. Part of the fun of this is how hard it is to get. I lucked out when we happened to be in Stowe, VT on the day they get their shipment. While it was one of the best double IPA's I've had, I can't call it the best beer in the world as some do. In my humble opinion, I'd put Pliny neck & neck. Cheers."
Great beer just difficult to get
Great clean flavor.
Completely lived up to its expectations
"Appearance: pours a pale straw yellow color, which is interesting because my friend, another drink it from the can rule breaker said his poured almost orange. A very fine bubbled head that dissipates quickly to a thin line where beer meets glass. "
"One of the most beautiful looking beers I've ever poured. Cloudy golden orange color with a bright white head. Nose is very fruity with loads of hop. Flavor was not what I expected. I didn't expect as much pine flavor as I got, especially given the citrusy nose. I got more fruit flavor as it wamed though. Feel was spot on. Great carbonation almost champagne like. Good beer but not sure it lived up to the hype."
"Looks beautiful. Hazy Orange smells just like pulped Orange Juice. High amounts of grapefruit and grapefruit bitterness. Excellent beer, best double ipa? Doubtful"
From the can (this gimmick annoys me but for brewer suggestion I will comply)
"While drinking a lovely IPA from ""Fiddlehead,"" the waiter presented an ice cold can (I'd never seen) and instructed, ""If you think that was good, try this."" With the latency of lightning came a surprise the likes of which I had never before experienced and have yet to duplicate since. Like the picture on the can, simply mind blowing. For a hop loving homo sapient such as myself, there is no beer I would rather have in hand, no commercial graphic that signals ultimate gustatory pleasure is imminent. Across look, smell, taste, and feel, as Billy Crystal might say, ""Simply mahvelous, darling."" I'd give it a 6, if I could."
Wonderful!!! Dankness
Best ever.
Poured into a glass:
Pours hazy gold with a nice frothy white head with great retention (though it does fade) and some nice sticky lacing.
"Finally reviewing Heady Topper. The beer we are asked to drink from the can. It is a very nice can, but I pour just a small amount of it into a glass to see the hazy straw, pale lemon yellow body with very little head to speak of. But since the beer's appearance is not supposed to be a part of the experience, I won't grade harshly on that. "
"Happiness lives up to the hype! Rose early for a rural, winding trek to a small grocer on The Alchemist's delivery route during my first trip to the Green Mountain State. Scored a case (cans only) which makes the trip worth all the effort! Pours a rich, moderately cloudy golden orange, like fresh nectar, with a medium head and tight lacing. Notes of mango and citrus reach out and smack the nose hairs immediately. Taste is powerfully citrus, cream and pine with a semi-sweetish flowery, tropical tenor; hoppiness finishes fast with no lingering bitterness. Careful - it begs to be gulped, but this should be savored. Bring your stopwatch. I have a case though, so perhaps a grandfather clock ;)"
BEST IPA on the market (if you can find that market)
"Words are barely adequate to describe the range of this beer. Pours a golden orange color. Cloudy but the brewery advises you to drink from the can so you don't have the sediment in the glass. If you drink from the can you miss all the citrus at the nose. This is a perfectly balanced DIPA that is crisp, drinkable and balanced in hops and bitterness."
As if anyone needs another review of this beer. Stood in line for 3 hours in Winooski VT to get this.
Well after many years and having tried over 300 IPA's i finally got my hands on a can of Heady Topper.
"16 oz. can. Pours cloudy yellow, thick white head. Fruity bready aroma. Grapefruit and earthy hops throughout the sip, super juicy and perfect balance. Creamy soft mouth. Dry finish with clean crisp sweetness. Overall this one deserves the high ratings, phenomenal."
"Purchased 4-pk of 16oz cans at bottle shop in Winooski, VT in mid-October 2014...delivered that day from the brewery. "
unfiltered
"It has been a while since I had this one, A good friend brought some up from Vermont when I lived in Quebec, and it didn't dissapoint, it might be overhyped, but credit is due for an exceptional balance to a insane tropical fruit hop blast that is refreshing, and not lingering or vegital."
"Pours almost orange with a bit of haze. The aroma is amazing. I get lots of pine from it. At first sip you get pine quickly followed by tropical fruit. So balanced, so drinkable. You honestly don't realize it's 8%."
L - Orange with edges fading to yellow. Cloudy but not overly. I see why they say drink from the can.
Doesn't really get much better. Consistency is important and that's what you get with this beer.
"I was never a fan of IPAs before I had heady and now I can't get enough hops. Great crisp double IPA, tons of floral hops, great mouth feel and finish."
"Rating is based on drinking from the can (with the look rating from an earlier can I poured into a glass). Smell is heavily floral, citrus, pine, onion, and just a hint of malt sweetness. Taste is tropical fruit mixed with pine, floral almost lavender-like taste, and a clean hop bitterness. Some double IPAs leave an increasingly bitter aftertaste with each sip, but Heady feels fresh every sip. Taste is extremely balanced, making the beer exceptionally drinkable. Mouthfeel is interesting, with an almost creamy feel. One of the only beers I've ever had that completely lives up to the hype. Wish I had regular access to it!"
"Finally got to try some. Drank out of the can, as per instructions. Big smell of pine. Very easy drinking for a double Ipa. All around a delicious beer. Probably not the best beer in the world though."
"I've had to drink a few cans of this (yeah, I got a case!) before I felt like I was ready to write a review. After all, this is the legendary Heady. I didn't go gaga over it at first sip so I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my palate. Maybe I was missing something. Or maybe it is all just hype. I've decided it's probably a combination of the two. It's not my favorite style of beer, but it is admittedly one of the most interesting examples of the DIPA style I've had."
Finally got my hands on this beer. Wow is it good. Was expecting a bit more wow from all the hype but didn't get it. Pliny blew me away but heady just delivered. But by no means am I disappointed. Cannot wait to get more of this.
Can. Vermont trip. 8 bought
Totally worth the 2 Sip O Sunshine that I had to trade to get it! It definitely lives up to the hype. What a wonderful flavor!
Heady-Topper is best in Class period - enough said!
This beer is a perfect example of an east coast DIPA. So incredibly smooth yet the amazing hop bitterness is still there. The smell is that of citrus goodness and the carbonation is spot on perfect.
"Amazing east coast IPA. Perfectly balanced beer with piney, citrusy notes and strong hop profile. Really smooth despite the bitterness. Great beer...perfect opposite to Pliny -- a premier east coast IPA opposite of Pliny being the premier west coast IPA."
My buddy brought me back 8 from Vermont. Very hop to the hoppy!!
Thanks Adam for the can!
"This is the Apple of DIPAs. It will be the one that people compare the ""best beer"" to for the foreseeable future. It is my favorite beer at the moment and is well worth the trip to VT"
Gold standard for hoppy beer.
"Not sure of some the the recent low 4 ratings, almost like there is a pushback against being the ""cool kid"" for too long. Unless some were given a random can not kept cold for the trip to whatever state they came across one in. Nonetheless this beer is truly amazing. And all the beers I've been lucky enough to have in say the top 20 on this board, it really is like splitting hairs of subjectivity. This is a big beer that can really showcase a dipa to people who think they don't like them. Extremely drinkable. Clean. Fresh. Personally I enjoy it better out of can as directed. But have had multiple times and poured in a glass as well to get a look and release a wonderful bouqet. Many master reviewers here have already described it so well in great detail. All I can say is ""agreed!"" I suspect the ones that demerit it have some sort of ulterior motive in trying to unseat the multi-year King. Oh well. Doesn't change the experience. And I'm sure the alchemist crew could care less what the rating is. They know they are doing a truly wonderful job. It is a bit of a circus obtaining at times, but hey, adds to the thrill of the chase. Ps. Focal banger is every bit as good."
"Let's start off by saying that I am not an IPA fan or a Double IPA fan. This beer however, changed my view of this particular style of beer. The first thing you notice is the fresh citrusy smell of the hops followed by the smell of pine. The beer starts off with a very hop forward taste and finishes with the customary hoppy IPA finish. I must say that this beer is unbelievably drinkable and is overall pleasing to the palate. A pleasant surprise since beers with this high of an IBU tend to be overly bitter and very hard to drink. Finally a beer worthy of its ranking."
Taste of the beer one of the best IPA on the market 
"Poured it into a glass, color wise pretty lack luster. Definitely a unique style of IPA I hadn't really had before. Sort of a cross between classic hoppy, bitter west cost and malt forward east coast styles. Great aroma, very balanced bitterness but for me - didn't quite live up to the incredible hype. Delicious beer, absolutely but left me wanting a little more."
"Poured into a glass! Screw following the can, I need to see the beer."
"First time with Heady. Have to say that the stand out part of it is the smoothness. I've had other IPA's with more flavor, other's with more happiness, but never any so smooth that goes down that easy. Truly a great IPA."
I have no idea what it looks like because I was told to Drink From The Can!
Can. Excellent ALE. Full bodied with an excellent taste. Smooth going down and a good smell. Yes this is worth all the hype. Can only purchase in VT and you are very limited. I had a friend give me 1 can.
Retouching this review for a 3rd time. What once was an amazing beer saw a couple years that seemed to left me wondering what happened to that amazing beer I had. Got my hands on one of the recent runs from the new brewery and I'm happy to say it was right back to the original beer I feel in love with. Big pine and soft peaches in perfect harmony with an earthy malt body. Exstatic to see all systems go for these guys
Dated 7/13/15; drank in tulip glass on 7/27/15
"Outstanding aroma, balance, flavors and finish."
I followed the can's directions so not sure how it looks but everything else is brilliant! A pure champion. Might have to take a road trip just to get some more. I'm hoping the name is a nod to Topper Headon!
"I'm not sure how old the can I drank was at time of consumption. I gave ""smell"" a 4.25 however I have to believe a beer this big has a big aroma when fresh. With that said, please take the 4.25 aroma as suspect. Taste and Feel live up to the hype for sure!"
"I can see how people think of this as a trophy brew. It's very good,huge citrus smack. Like drinking a glass (yep,didn't read the instructions) of grapefruit juice. Had a slight,bitter (lemon) aftertaste. Overall,a wonderful brew."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Nose is of huge grapefruit and grapes, absolutely fantastic. Taste was not as good, but tons of piny and citrus bitterness. Is an upper tier upper, top 5%, but not the best, the new wave of east coast ipa's are crushing it, would take numerous ipa's from Other Half & Trillium instead, and they are easier to obtain than Heady."
The best there is.
"Purchased in Montpelier, VT on July 20, 2015 (the same day that it came off the delivery truck) and consumed with notes taken the following day. In other words, this baby was fresh."
"One of the few Double IPA'S that deserves the hype it gets and definitely the one that set the bar. Yes, there is Treehouse and Hillfarmstead but heady in my opinion paved the way for other great New England Ipa's."
I'm going to go similar to Blackboard on this review...
"I don't throw around high scores on beers but this one totally deserves it. This does not taste like any other Double IPA I have tried before. Even with its 100 IBUs, the first thnig that washs over your palate is not 'bitter' but 'fresh'. Like drinking a newly mown lawn fresh. And smooth. It's hard to describe. The only knock is on the look which is pale and slightly cloudy but maybe that's why they encourage drinking from the can :-). Drove 900 miles from Virginia and waited in line for 90 minutes at Winooski Beverage to get my hands on a case to bring back to share with friends."
"This is one of those beers that I've had on multiple occasions at multiple different freshness dates. It's fantastic don't get me wrong, but I've never had a can (even one that was canned less than 5 days old) where I was absolutely dumbfounded how good it is."
Best IPA I have ever had. Most amazing aroma off of a beer. Lots of juiciness in the taste with citrus and pine dominating. Taste lingers with a great bitter finish.
"Well, here it goes. The number 1 (now 2) beer in the world. Pours a gorgeous hazy orange. Smells of citrus, pine and hoppy goodness. Tastes follows through. Awesome creamy mouthfeel. I can definitely see why this is the top beer. It's amazing, if just a hair under focal banger, due to a bit too much bitterness on the backend for my taste (but I'm just splitting hairs). Amazing stuff!"
I never get tired of drinking this. Drinking this against most other popular IPA's and Double IPA's will make them taste too harsh or malty or grassy.
Really well made brew. Definitely worth the hype.
Fortunate enough to have been drinking this for years. Still top-notch and consistent as ever.
"Oh, What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz. Special beer, from a special place. Truly not much more needs to be said. Drink it from the can and drink it in Vermont."
Tasted many times first can to the head. Such an easy drinking yet complex ipa.
I was extremely lucky to be given a can recently. This is definitely an excellent DIPA and the best I've ever had. I drank half from the can as it recommends and half from an IPA glass. Honestly it was better from the glass but to each their own.
anyone want to trade for some breakfast stout from last year?
"Classic double IPA. One of the best around- can't beat this beer fresh, might be the best IPA in the world. The most balanced of the style ever."
Perfect. Lives up to the hype. Even better with good friends.
"Drank most from the can but the appearance from what I did pour in the glass was beautiful. So smooth with tons of Tropical fruit upfront, balanced resin finish. In the top 10 for sure."
"Not the best IPA I've ever had, but it's something every beer fanatic should try. It revolutionized the beer game and for that I am thankful. An excellent beer"
"Exceptional IPA, the hype for this beer is defiantly where it should be."
"Really excellent IPA,. Tons of grapefruit on the nose and palate. Very balanced for the high level of bitterness. An all-around excellent beer."
"Just a solid DIPA, but there's nothing to rave about here."
"I feel like trying this beer is a craft beer lovers rite of passage and I was finally able to cross this one odd my list. I really enjoyed it and found it to be extremely drinkable and not overly hoppy for a DIPA. At the same time I can't say it was the cathartic experience I was hoping for, but rather just a very good beer. Will habe again if given the opportunity, but this will probably be my last time hunting it down"
"It is the best beer I have tasted. It has a very smooth inviting aroma, great body, and what I personally like best, a great after taste. It literally lingers in my mouth for a couple hours after I finished the beer."
The Best of the Rest
"Wow - given 100 score on BA was expecting so much more, just an avg+ 2×IPA for me. Will try again, certainly not bad though."
this beer is hop heaven and perfectly balanced
"I had this brew for the first time the other night. I work at a homebrew supply shop in Southern PA and a customer was kind enough to get some cans for us. It is a fantastic brew, but certainly not the best I've had -- but it's all subjective! I compare this to Lawson's Sip of Sunshine, and I have to say that Lawson's beer wins this one for me. Nevertheless, if you get a chance the try this beer, do it! You certainly won't regret it."
"Just an all around show stopping beer. Lots of tropical fruit that comes in wave after delicious wave with a touch of a lemon grass in there. Bitterness not overwhelming, but a nice balance . A truly great beer."
What more can be said...a truly great beer.
"I was hooked at first sip. After lusting after this beer for years I finally got to try it several times recently, thanks to friends, and I have to say it really lived up to the hype. I can't think of a beer I've heard more about and the whole experience still managed to live up. I can understand know how this beer really broke the way for others like it that have come since. Also more good beer like this needs to be put into cans."
Highly drinkable citrusy goodness. 
"Pours golden orange and hazy and chalky. Smells like fruit with some hops and sweet malts. Taste is like a breath of fresh air. Bitter and crisp, with citrus and dry bready finish. Fantastic malt flavor, heavily hopped but it retains balanced. Great flavor and drinkability from start to finish. This beer can be on the inconsistent side. My first review of this beer was a 4.78/5... but after having had multiple since then, I figured it needed a new review. Still delicious, but it can be the victim of inconsistency."
"I've been looking forward to trying this for years now. Living in NJ I can't tell you how many times I've had friends or co workers promise they would bring back some from a trip to VT or "" my buddy/cousin/whoever lives up there, I'll get them to bring it down "" but all fell through. I finally decided to take a road trip. I planned it well and did the round trip in a day, came back w 2 cases plus some other VT beers. Successful trip I'd say. Anyway, with all the hype and what I had to go through to get some Heady I was finally ready to see for myself. Well - I can see why this beer gets all the talk. This isn't even my favorite style, I'm a BBA Stout guy but I must say this is a fantastic brew. Outrageous flavor that just keeps getting better. No question Heady is deserving of its # 1 status. Long live the king !!"
A friend brought me a can from his VT trip. WOW! Nice aroma. Well-balanced. I like the use of malt that allows you to enjoy the hops and not be overrun by them. Heady has now moved into a first place tie with Bell's Hopslam as my ATF. Problem is now I want another one and I'm not planning any trips to VT in the near future!
"I was given a can by an extremely generous BA on here, this was my white whale and I have now slayed it and it was worth every ounce of hype. I took the first sip and it was great, maybe not the best beer I've ever had but it was up there. The more it warmed up it got better with every sip until I could literally think of nothing I would change about the beer. A steady supply of this would be dangerous, and IIPA's aren't even my favorite style of beer but this is my favorite beer I have tried yet in my short time diving in to craft beer. Side note, I drank about half from a glass and half from the can, and maybe it's just in my head because they tell you to on the can, but I think I liked straight from the can a little better."
Great IPA. No bad after taste juat delicious light and easy to drink. Def recommend if you can get your hands on it
"Well.. it wasn't MIND BLOWING... but it was a perfectly balanced IPA... not my favorite, but I'd get it again."
"I'm not going to do the typical L S T F O stuff that is on this site for this beer. I have frequented the site for years and years and this is the beer that made me have to do a review. I was skeptical when I obtained this beer. It can't be worth the hype. It can't be as good as this website says it is. I'm here to write that it is, without a doubt, the most incredible DIPA I have ever had. Not too strong, yet still flavorful. Still aromatic. I drank it form the can so I can't comment on the look but I don't care. This is a beer that is extremely hard for me to obtain in the area I am. I never thought I would get this beer. And now that I have, every IPA I have ever had fails in comparison. It was perfect."
"A - The beauty here is in seeing what is coming, but the golden orange body, opaque, and moderate thin white head, are not stunning. The can art is great, and it is not a bad looking beer, but it is not exceptionally good looking."
Great beer. Solved the problem with the supply of Heady Topper. I just brewed a clone version and was virtually identical.
"Don't know how it looks, following the directions and drinking from the can! Smells of hops, pine, grapefruit, kind of muted coming from the can. Taste is as advertised, wave after wave of hops, juicy citrus and some resinous pine but just enough malt to keep it balanced. Moderately carbed and medium body keeps this pretty easy drinking. Overall, good IPA, still not sure it deserves all the hype, a lot of others out there that are just as good."
"This is a great beer. I think the exclusivity feeds the hype a bit. Its hype creates a few more naysayers among the people ive talked to about it. Nonetheless, its at the top of the list for a reason. Great taste, packs a punch, drink it in the can like it says, i do notice a difference. Its got that murky unfiltered look anyway so the glass wont do much for you. I cant tell yet if i like this or Lawsons sip o' sunshine better. But i do know i wish both companies expanded their distribution to other areas than vermont."
I could drink this all day long. Superb!
"Got one can given to me by a customer at my job in buffalo new york, and it was absolute perfection to my taste buds. I would recommend this masterpiece to anyone. My only disappointment is that the brewery is 7 hours from my house, and it's nearly impossible to obtain even a can around here."
Finally got my hands on a couple cans of it and it didn't dissapoint. Poured the last of my can into a pint glass just to get a look at it. One of the few beers that lives up to the hype! A crushable dipa for sure.
"Astounding. Perfect on every level. With each sip, the full hop flavor comes through just as much, if not more, than the first sip."
Awesome beer. I was fortunate enough to try this from a friend who brought a couple cans home with him to NJ. It's definitely one of my favorites.
"pours a a hazed golden yellow with a white head nice retention/lacing,smell was floral and tropical but not overly so,taste fantastic array of citrus,floral,tropical taste with just a kiss of sweet malts -superb,mouth feel was medium carbonation with very little bitterness, supreme 2ipa here easy to drink with a great hop profile ABV well hidden"
"Heady is my favorite IPA so far, although IPA is not my favorite style. For me, an IPA needs to have something to set it apart, as a lot of hoppy beers taste the same to me. Heady has a really nice pine scent and taste that I have not seen duplicated elsewhere. It really just tastes like Vermont; you can almost imagine that there are pine needles floating in the beer. However, I wouldn't go to the lengths that some people do to get it, especially since there's a VERY limited window where Heady is at its peak freshness."
G_d bless the alchemist.
"I do not think this is the best in the world at all, unless you like your DIPA very sweet."
"All the hype is annoying, but unlike most highly hyped things, Heady Topper deserves every bit of the praise. Excellent DIPA, sets the bar high."
OVERRATED!!! Not even in my top 10 IPA's.
Very enjoyable. Great hop flavor and aroma.
"Almost all 5's across the board. Bright, juicy hop flavor. If I could get my hands on this one all the time it would be in my fridge for sure. Do I think it deserves the #1 spot? Probably not... But it's for sure up there with some of the best of the style I have had (perhaps top 3 or so). Very tasty beer, well made."
Almost untouchable in every facet. 
"Four pack from a trade. Amazingly balanced, neck and neck with Keene Idea and Pliny as my fav IPA..."
"Great floral taste and smell. Beautiful bitter, hoppy-ness without being overpowering. Extremely smooth."
"Citrusy and piney. Not quite as malty as some other IPAs that I've had, but probably one of the best IPAs I've ever enjoyed. Would love to taste blind next to Pliny."
Three week old can and poured into a long stemmed tulip glass.
Good as always. Worth the effort
I couldn't score the look a 5. It's in a can.
A blast of flavor. Great hop forward taste. Lived up to hype
Decent beer. I'm on the westcoast and know PtE and HT to hand for hand but after finally trying it'll be trading identical beers. HT has more floral on the nose than PtE's nutty aroma. HT was more Hoppy than PtE IMO but not more harsh on the swallow. Overall I like PtE slightly better
"As soon as I poured it, the aroma was intense. Hops, some tropical notes, some pine. Nice mouthfeel and intense flavor. Happy to say it lived up to my high expectations."
"This beer is absolutely delicious, and the smell is unreal. Very difficult to acquire but isn't too expensive if you can find it, and well worth the attempt if you find yourself in the area!"
"Pours opaque in its cloudiness. Bright amber with a small head. The smell will punch you in the face with hops. You KNOW it's a good beer when you open the can and the aroma begins to fill the room. The taste is absurdly hoppy. It's literal hop juice. So many levels at once: juicy, bitter, piney, grassy, dank. It's all there. This is a raw and unabated DIPA. A once in a lifetime experience for folks outside of New England. Try it and you will understand its love. Good luck topping the Topper."
"No date of freshness on the can, approximately it was canned two month ago. "
Appearance - hazy golden liquid with white head
"Had this beer at a restaurant in Stowe, VT on a recommendation from the server. Thought it was one of the best IPA's I had ever tasted. The hop flavor hits you in waves as you drink the beer, very flavorful."
Really great ipa very well rounded with a unique finish that disappears of the ol taste buds
So flavorful it satisfied a hop head llike me. So well rounded and balanced it's pleasing to a weakling like my wife.
"L: Can't get much better than an unfiltered, filthy looking IPA. "
incredible smell with an even better taste
"A friend brought back two cans from Vermont a couple weeks ago. Drank some from the can and it wasn't doing it for me. Poured the rest in the glass. Nice hazy amber. Aroma and mouthfeel were nicer from a glass. Very drinkable. Not one of those beers that I say, ""Whoa! Now that's good."" After drinking, I came to believe that these reviews may be somewhat skewed by the beer's high alcohol content. I liked it better at the end when I was buzzed."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color. The nose contains citrus fruits, pine and some breadiness. The taste is really well balanced and juicy. A really soft bitterness fades quickly on the dry finish."
"Had this at a small pub in Stowe last summer on vacation. Didn't go looking for it, just fell in to my lap. Best I ever drank. Incredibly smooth. Rated the look only because its mandatory. This went right from the can to my mouth so I never really got a look at it."
"Gold in color, hazy, clingy white head sticks to the glass."
"Great beer. There are some other beers out there that I enjoy a little more, but this is definitely worth drinking if you are afforded the opportunity."
Definitely lives up to the hype
"Look - Light and inviting, golden yellow with a slight amount of murkiness"
"First tried this last summer, dutifully out of the can. This time, I poured it. It pours a very, and surprisingly, murky yellowish-orange hue. Plenty of pine and floral scents in the aroma. If chilled before drinking, which this can was, there seems to be a slight carbonated bite to the initial feel, which is at first, and to the last, solid-bodied. Taste is nice and piney, with a tinge of bitterness and an even slighter near white wine tang at the end. I poured this into a pint glass, and this settled into itself two-thirds of the way through--good head and a nice syrupy taste developed. I enjoyed the overall drink. It didn't quite measure up to the intense hype, but still an enjoyable brew."
Poured from the can (against instruction!) Into a wine glass.
"I had this at least a couple of weeks old, would love to give a few day old a shot. Unlike other epic DIPAs, this had a more grassy dankness rather than a juicy one. It almost felt like the taste profile is grassy/earthy based (in a good way) rather than juicy/citrusy/fruity based like Maine Dinner or Carton 077xx. "
What is there to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. The smell is tropical citrus goodness. Could drink this beer all day long. Absolutely world class.
"A very nice DIPA, though not mind-blowing like the rumor mill would suggest. I think it's particularly popular because it doesn't blow your mouth's sides out with hops - this is more influenced by English-style beers, and it shows. Very well done."
"Enjoyed mostly from the can, but with some poured into a 4oz Sierra Nevada tulip pint style tasting glass"
this is a great beer that i tasted while visiting Boston area in dec.14... it could be the number one beer but i am waiting to give it a taste test with Santa Fe Pivitol ipa (two hoppers in my ref.)
Hype worthy! Will stay on my wants list.
Very tasty layered IPA. Hard to get here in SD but I was able to trade for it. Piny floral notes up front with a nice smooth cirus finish.
"I live close enough in MA to have had this beer a little over 100 times now. Each time it does not disappoint. Smell, flavor, just the right amount of bite. The DIPA all others are compared to for good reason."
"Creamy, balanced....easy drinkin' IPA"
"Drank from the can as advised, to say the least this was a phenomenal DIPA. And to be honest it was exactly what I expected it to be. Wether or not it belongs at the number 1 spot is not for me to decide but it is a great beer defiantly worth a try! Cheers!"
"Traveled 200+ miles to buy this beer even before tasting it. Once the first sip touched my lips and trickled down my throat i knew what i had just tasted was greatness. The after taste is literally thirst quenching, by far the best IPA ive ever had, and to top it off its a double IPA! yet soo smooth. Anyways, the fruity smell and perfect amount of hoppy taste followed by a smooth after taste is next to none. Highly recommend this beer!"
An absolutely amazing beer. The Double IPA on this beer tastes like no other. I am in NY and my friend brought me back a can from Vermont. All I can say is you really need to try this brew because it is completely unique and tastes like none other.
Straight from the can. Purchased today in Burlington.
"I had two of these within 3 days. I drank from the can as recommended(therefore the color is rated lower). However it is a strange recommendation as it limits the possibility to smell the beer. It is a very hoppy beer with a strong citrus feel. It is slightly too high in alcohol as you can feel it almost immediately but I guess it is normal for a double IPA. Cannot see the date on the cans but bought one from Skinny Pancake in Montpelier and the other from the farmhouse tap and grill in Burlington, which I strongly recommend for their beer selection and food."
"Hadn't had Heady in about year and a half. Since then I have tried a plethora of new amazing beers from up and coming breweries, like TreeHouse and Trillium, which made me wonder if I still liked Heady just as much as I used to. I was able to score a can last week and had it yesterday for my birthday. To my surprise, it still lives up to its hype! It might not be my favorite DIPA anymore, but it is definitely up there in the top 5."
"Only beer ever that made my whole body tingle after a few sips. Somehow hits you on the chin, although not extremely strong, but at the same time has a long lasting, complex feel. I'm not articulate in the sommelier language, more like ""this be real good, gotta stock cave"" kinda guy: in my way I recommend it without hesitation. Travelling to Vermont over the Memorial Day weekend I planned on buying it because of the hype (I live in Massachusetts where it's not available) and stood in a line for nearly 3 hours to get a 24-can case. Time well spent."
Such a great tasting beer
"Let me start out by saying I'm not a lover of very hoppy beers - so going into this was interesting as I knew it would be high on hops -- but there is also the whole ""trying to even get your hands on this"" mystique that made me need to try it?!"
"Hard to believe that it was five years ago this week that I graduated from Columbia. It was not easy for me while I was there and the time since could have been kinder to me as well. I got to march earlier this week with the other alums and since I didn't want (or get) any gifts for graduation, a can of this that I traded for up at the Cloverleaf was all I wanted as a gift. Never before was I so excited to have a beer given the lofty ranking of this on here and even though it wasn't quite a ""5"" in my book, I can easily see why so many people on here enjoy this!"
"Plenty of hoppy goodness. Drank from the can as instructed, but had to get a look at this beauty so I poured a little in a glass. It was cloudy and the mouthfeel was defintely not thin. Very impressed, the aroma was amazing."
"Had to try it being a local of the area and having easy access to the brewery. I don't believe I am personally experienced enough to fully appreciate/enjoy this beer but It wasn't terrible. Looks and smells FANTASTIC!!!! There were too many flavors hitting me all at once for me to really enjoy it but after the tour, I saw how much thought and effort goes into making it. Definitely one of the best beers out there it was just hard for me to enjoy personally. I highly recommend for the experienced beer drinkers :D"
"Awesome beer, but not balanced enough."
"Super hoppy, super good. Part of the fun is the adventure up to VT and how hard it is to get your paws on it - but gotta love that this is always soo worth it."
Just ok...possible I got an older can. No date listed anywhere I could see.
This beer lived up to its reputation for me. It was the perfect compliment to the meal.
Could be the perfect beer. String hops and grapefruit tones. Amazing smell and a strong finish.
"Not a big IPA fan in general but a friend happened to bring some to a party. Very citrusy aroma. For taste the bitterness was not overpowering which I expected (not being an experienced IPA DIPA drinker) . I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the pine and citrus together. I will begin to try more IPAs because of this but from the few I've had, this is easily the best tasting and most enjoyable."
First time having this beer in three years. Found one for trade that I am sure is fresh. 
"In all honesty this beer is #1 for a reason, hype alone it's still the most complex beer that i've ever had. In one sip it goes from citrus bomb to dank, back to citrus and then finishes dry with pine like hops. So many flavors and the hop aroma smell should be a scented candle! The only beer to come close, complex wise is ""SWISH"" by Bissell Brothers!"
"I live in Bridlington vt and would call this brew no more than a fad. I've had people I don't even know (friend of a friend) hit me up just to help them get an extra case to bring home wIth them to New York. It's good, yeah, perhaps my pallet is discerning, but I'd love to see something new from the alchemist or hill farmstead uproot this silly phase"
Damn good. Pulls it all off despite Everest expectations.
"Solid beer, but the best? I think others are better. That said, I won't turn these down."
I had a few cans recently and the quality of this beer went down. Last year's production was delicious and hoppy. This year tasted like a unfresh malt bomb.
"Pours an opaque lemon yellow color with a huge fluffy bright white head. Lemon, celery and cucumber with a bit of pine on the nose. Taste is bright and lemony up front with a juniper hop bitterness on the back."
Wow. As good as ranked and expected
"Mouthfuls of fluffy hoppiness. Super smooth and delicious. It's more hoppy than words can describe, and yet, not too much so. Worth drinking every chance you can get your hands on it."
wave after wave of hops! i drove 200 miles for this beer. it did not disappoint.
Good to have a Vermont connection.
unbelievable. it met all expectations however inflated I thought they might be!
"After hearing the hype surrounding this beer, I went on an adventure to obtain it in upstate Vermont. After taking off a day from work, I traveled almost 4 hours to hop in the lines at the venues where this was being delivered that Thursday. I was accompanied by a whole bunch of craft beer lovers. Without disappointment, I was able to obtain several cases of this elusive gem! Following directions, I drank this straight from the can and what a surprise it was... by far one of the best double IPAs in the country. I can realistically see why this beer is so sought after. If you haven't already, do your best to obtain a fresh can of this beer... it will change your thoughts about craft beer. Cheers!"
"Delicious. If I fall into some more I will happily drink it, but probably not differentiated enough from readily available double IPAs to make the hassle worth it."
"This beer changed my life. It changed what I thought about beer and what a hoppy beer could be. There are several other great DIPAs that rival it (Second Fiddle, Dbl Sunshine, Pliny, ...) but Heady has a special place in my heart."
"Nice orange juice flavor, balanced sweetness and bitterness."
"I was honestly hoping that this beer was too hyped, but boy was I wrong!"
"Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. No canned on date, but picked this up recently in a trade and was told it's ""as fresh as can be"", so I'm assuming no more than 2-3 weeks old at this point. "
"Admittedly, I'm not a huge DIPA guy, but I don't get it. Cloudy and not as smooth as I thought it would be. Aftertaste lingers forever. Not horrible but I expected much more."
The beer I judge all by.
Good but wasn't blown away
Just untouchable. Must be the water in Vermont.
"Drove up to Barre, VT to pick up a case to bring to my Dad in Mississippi--retiring after 39 years teaching. And this beer is as good as they say."
"First, thanks to the nameless one in Vista for the can I got to share with my girlfriend, I got to try Heady without having to either trade for it or go to Vermont. :) I have had so many wonderful DIPAs that I knew right from the first sip that nothing would shock me with greatness ever again; but drinking this beer, I could definitely understand why it's (currently) the top rated beer. "
Lives up to the hype...excellent DIPA
"Let me begin with a precursor: I've had Heady on several occasions, my first being almost four years ago. I'm writing this review because this batch from early February when I purchased a case is simply a shell of its former self and must have something wrong with it (and not because it's been 3 months since it was canned; because it tasted the same right after I bought it and it's been refrigerated ever since and should still be plenty drinkable at this stage). Cracking a can brings an overwhelming smell and subsequent taste of peanut butter, peanut oil and peanuts. As I am not a homebrewer, though I work in beer retail, I do not know how to pinpoint this off-flavor/smell (i.e. diacetyl), but it is certainly not the Heady that blew my mind when I first had it four years ago. My main motivation in writing this review is to alert others to the possibility that clearly not all batches of Heady are created equal now. If this can be chalked up to mishandling (exposure to heat), and is not a fault of The Alchemist, I would certainly understand. But as I purchased this case in the midst of a bone-chilling winter, I find that possibility not very plausible. And don't get me wrong; this is not intended to throw The Alchemist, John and Jen or their staff under the bus. They are working tirelessly to bring this beer to the masses of VT, the U.S., and now--yes--the world. Hopefully this is simply an anomaly and their quality control only improves with further batches, yet now with their increased production and the new Stowe facility, this may only become more difficult in the future. As a die-hard craft drinker and one who knows where Heady belongs in the upper echelon of DIPAs, I hope this does not prove to be the case."
Absolutely delicious IPA. Incredibly well balanced while still juicy (lots of tropical notes) and a great hoppy finish that lingers w a citric bitterness. Love this beer.
I make trips frequently to northern Vermont and I always search for this beautiful creation in a can. I'm very happy about the breweries newest adventure with their beer room facilities opening soon.
16oz can poured into a stemless Heady Topper glass
"Picked up case max last Tuesday while looking for Sip Of Sunshine. Great drinkability and balance. As I have heard, the flavor does change as you move through the layers. Hop flavor and bitterness come at you from all different angles."
"Hard to find, but definitely worth the wait. Nothing but greatness!"
This was such a let down. I've had almost every beer on the top 250 list and I can name 10 beers that are better than this one. Womp.
"Dry, bitter, slightly sticky. Definitely good but definitely not worth freaking out over."
I never get tired of this beer. It's one of the fluffiest DIPAs ever with such a wonderful punch of hops that linger. The finish is super clean and leaves you dying for another sip. Too bad it's such a pain to get :)
Revived a 4 pack from a trade. 
"5's all across the board. Best smelling, tasting and finishing beer. I have ever had."
Can poured into glass I'm almost positive that they tell you to drink it in the can because In a glass it does not look so great but in this case looks are definitely deceiving nice tropical fruit aromas that also come through in the flavor with a nice bitter hoppy finish outstanding ipa that lives up to the hype
"Can't find flaws in this one, or too many better double IPAs for that matter. There are better, but they are few and far between. There's really nothing negative to say - the look, smell, taste, feel, and whatever else you care about are damn near perfect. It's not the best beer I have ever had but it's pretty damn close"
"I finally got to try this thanks to a coworker who got some in a trade. I drank it from the can as directed. It was very good, however, I feel this beer should not still be at #1. I had Pliny the Elder a week ago and liked it a lot more. But, fwiw, I think I like FW Double Jack more than this, so do what you will with this review."
"What can I say, awesome piny hop nose, just keeps coming at you. sweet malty start then just a dank hop explosion on the tongue. Outstanding beer."
"At this point, reviewing Heady Topper is analogous to rating the character of Derek Jeter. Everything great has been said, everything said has been great, and that standard is not going away. So, we are no longer worthy of trying to compare this IPA to anything else on the market. A reviewer below writes that although Heady is ""an incredible IPA, there are others equally as good."" I think they are claiming that there is no better beer being brewed in the world right now, than what is being produced here in the US. I almost completely agree. The only exception is maybe Belgium, and their exotic ales, however, Brewery Ommegang has made the gap very small these days. Anyway, USA is killing it, and the beer buffet out there has something great for everyone. The only criticism of the referenced blog below would be that a reader could get the impression that they were placing Heady head-to-head with the likes of Rogue Dead Guy Ale. That would be like comparing an 18 year aged cheddar to light orange ballpark nacho melt. Not that there is anything wrong with either. We all have our favorites, and it's nice that the writer below is proud and loyal to the other great beers out there, and publishes their support. This makes the world go round, and keeps all of these committed brewers thriving. I enjoy them all too."
The benchmark everything else. Truly in a class of it's own.
"Quick review. There's nothing I can say here that hasn't already been said. This brew is a classic for a reason, one of the very best IPA offerings that I've tasted."
"Simply the greatest IPA on the market. Only bummer is that even though I live in West Rutland, VT, I have drive north to find it as well as making sure I hit the store at the right time. All in all, it's worth the drive and the wait. This beer is definitely worth the top of the list rating it enjoys."
"This is an incredible IPA. I am not sure it's worth the hype. There are others that are just as good. Dogfish Head 90 Minute, Wachusetts Larry, Bells Two Hearted, Rogue Dead Guy Ale, ADK Super Dort and Foley Brothers Fair Maiden are all equally good. Hard to tell for certain which is best. They are all good in there own right."
Not really an IPA guy but it was by far the best IPA I have had. Great hoppy taste at beginning with a smoothe finish.
"My buddy gave me this beer when I got back form Texas back in November 2014. This is an amazing DIPA. Amazing crisp taste with hints of citrus, orange, and grapefruit. Left me wanting more! I need to visit Vermont and grab me some Heady!"
Not as good as i was expecting. Could use a bit more balance on the back end. Overall a juicy thick great beer.
Ahhmazing. Used to live in Mass and made a trade with a friend from VT for Pliny the Elder
This is an exceptional beer. Even friends who are not big fans of IPAs respect this beer for its nuance and complexity. This is really an outstanding achievement in beer making and a beer that I will enjoy at any opportunity. I've already done the road trip to norther Vermont a few times now and will do again.
"This beer is perfection in a can. From the initial hoppy ""kick"" to the face. The taste slowly mellows out as the can empties. At the end you feel very very satisfied and slightly buzzed from the 8%."
2 words to describe this one.......none better!
This beer is like no other.
Great balanced DIPA! It is certainly better in the can. I will definitely try to find more.
"Great smell of pine and grassy hops. Actually does taste better from the can! Great fresh bitter taste, citrus, exotic fruits, drank it when it was only 2 weeks old, probably the freshest I can get here in the Netherlands."
Probably the greatest beer I've ever had the privilege of drinking
"Another personal favorite, can't get enough of this beer"
I'm 14 oz. into my first Heady Topper.
Palate-pleasing. Received as a gift for its difficulty to obtain. Now I know why.
Flawless. I don't buy into hype. I didn't buy the hype on this. Heady might be the perfect beer. Looking forward to a future road trip to Vermont to scope some out!!!
"Wow, definitely lived up to the hype for me. Bold hoppiness but with a citrus and almost pineapple fresh flavor complexity that was truly delicious."
"A very well balanced IPA. Drink fresh and enjoy it, if you can find it."
"Sorry guys, the smell was good but I just do not like IPAs. I need some other flavor and after taste besides bitter hops. It wasnt smooth at all. ABV isnt noticeable though."
"World class DIPA. Undoubtedly. Citrus, crisp, bitter, smooth. The aroma is right on par with the unreal taste - it's a blast of citrus, pine and pith that hovers around the can. I'm a fan of drinking straight from the can but no harm is wrought if it's poured into a glass. So many in-depth reviews on here so I'll be brief - big body with a soft mouthfeel supplemented by an entirely unique cascade of citrus, pine and bitter-hop flavors. The bouquet of apricot, orange rind, lemon, grapefruit, crackery malt, tobacco and tea hits hard up front then proceeds to coat the mouth and linger for a few seconds after the sip. Gorgeous. Nothing like it."
One of the most complex flavors I've ever had. I get something different with every taste. High alcohol content goes almost unnoticed. No beer I've ever had is anything like this.
So crisp and fresh for an IPA
Great beer. Lived up to the hype for me.
"Definitely lived up to the hype. Mouthfeel wasn't quite as crisp as I like, but just my personal preference. Excellent beer."
"This beer pours a hazy bright yellow golden color with a huge, frothy bright white head. Retention is excellent with a one finger cap lasting the entire beer and many chunky hanging sheets of lacing. Smell is a citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, and a slight bit of dankness pine are all present. Taste is the same with just moderate amount of bitterness. Feel is very soft at first with a prickly bitterness on the back end. Overall a very good beer."
One of the best doubles. Complex. Enjoy every sip
"Single best nose ever for me. Worthy of all the Hype. Had it fresh side by side with Zombie Dust - different style but still a top 10 beer for me, and Heady killed it. Just super impressive."
An amazing double ipa can't get much better than this
Not even the best beer in Vermont.
Look: Poured the can into a tulip glass. Fluffy head with a lot of bubbles. Gold and murky.
"After all the hype, I expected more....too much? Pretty much like drinking grapefruit juice. I also question the instructions to drink from the can, a good beer should be able to be appreciated from a glass."
"I never heard of this beer until someone plopped a fresh cold unopened can down in front of me. My first thought was I love the graphics and the name. But i was a little apprehensive to drinking it from the can. But holy hell were the contents of that can just marvelous. My favorite thing was the aftertaste. Savoring each moment between sips, I found myself sipping just to recharge that taste. Man, this beer was just AMAZING. If you can someway get your hands on it. Drink the living shit out of it."
Vey complex flavors. Goes down smooth for a 2X IPA. Can't have enough when I have it once a year.
"Was lucky enough to try fresh Heady. Perhaps its all the talk or maybe it is all the beer that is available now, but I like others much better. This is a great beer just not one I would search out. I am very glad I had the chance to try it and would encourage others to do so as the beauty of beer is everyone has a different palate and even that changes over time."
"Great smell. Lots of citrus, some pepper and lots of hops! Very enjoyable!"
It's a beautiful beer. Amazing
Is it a very good beer? 100% yes. 
"super crushable yet complex, will see out more in the future. How does such a small state have such incredible breweries I ask?"
I'm a Vermonter. I love Vermont and the beer we have to offer. I would share this beer with whoever would like a taste of what we have to offer as a small state with some of the best breweries in the country.
"Wow, simply amazing. It is insane how easy this is to consume for being a DIPA."
How many hops can you cram into a can yet still make it well balanced and insanely crushable? Pretty much the gold standard of ipas. I've tried it in every kind of glassware imaginable but enjoy heady so much more right out of the can.
Amazing beer. Lucky to have someone next to the brewery.. Haha fresh heady all the time
Hands down the Best Beer I've ever drank
Look: The can looks awesome when you can see it. Unfortunately every time I go to Vermont I see an empty space where this beer is supposed to be. Why does everyone want this stuff so bad? Let me explain.
Amazing beer. Hops for days. Drink it from the can! 99/100
Had it many times still my all time favorite....
"If you're into IPAs, this is the beer for you. Drink from the can, as soon as you open the smell hits hard; Intense hops. Taste is just like the smell, punches you in the face with the hops. With the high IBU rating it's not a surprise. Easy to drink, but stay away from too many as you'll get numb from the flavor."
"This is an exceptional beer. As instructed on the can, I drank it out of the can. It was delicious. For my second one, I opted to drink it out the glass. I would recommend the glass."
Lives up to the hype pretty well!
"I am sorry!!! the Beer is cloudy as hell and better in the can. However, i came from around the world and have been Homebrewing for 8 years; just to drive countless hours and wait in line; only to take a sip of the worlds finest! Yes, it lives to its standards! I e-mailed the company and all the stores to assure myself and acquire some of this brew! I got turned down by both saying to follow the truck and wait in line. I did and popped my first can at Route 7 in Shelburne VT at 945 in the morning to find the LOve of my IPA's!! A very balanced and strong double IPA leaving resigns of pine flavor in my mouth many minutes after drinking. 5 out of 5 for sure and still to this day worth the wait as i did on 30-March-2015 at Route 7 in Shelburne VT. Thank you, I will do this again just to get a case. Chris"
The best beer in existence.
Pretty much the perfect beer! Hops are slammed into this can and the smoothness is undeniable. Wish I could get it more but am so grateful to those kind enough to let me try it. Cheers!
A treat every time I get to have one.
One of the best beers I've ever had!
As good ad advertised. Poured out of the can into glasses because I wanted to see what a legend looks like. Really excellent. We are living in the golden age of brewing. Enjoy.
Fantastic IPA. Totally solid. Hype-worthy.
Exceptional dgipa from the alchemist.
"I obeyed and drank straight from the can. spritzy, splash of citrus. hoppy and toppy. T slight grapefruit. F all other beers. Overall ... As good as people said I think it should taste. I love what reviews tell me to love and this is DEFINATELY one the worst spellings of definitely out there. I believe Heady Topper is not alone at the top though as, in my opinion, other people have told me that other beers compete."
"I disobeyed and poured into glass. L golden and hazy. S piney and hoppy. T slight citrus and sweet. F smooth and balanced. Overall ... As good as advertised. I love DIPA's and this is DEFINATELY one of the best. I believe Heady Topper is not alone at the top though as, in my opinion, Gandhi Bot and Sip of Sunshine are also in the same class."
Was very happy to grab a few when i could. Sadly it didnt live up to what i was expecting. i guess it's all the hype on it being so limited in availability. Overall its a solid IPA just not the BEST AROUND... in my opinion.
A friend from Vermont hooked it up and brought a few cans over.
Just got back from Vermont on a one day beercation. Got a case of topper at the beverage baron. 2 four packs at another store down the street and two more 4 packs in Burlington. Nice dank aroma. Hop forward with tropical hints. Very smooth mouth feel.
Over ten thousand beer geeks have rated Heady # 1 for the past 2 yrs. strong. Cheers to us!
One of the best IPA's (imo). I had to pour a little in a glass just to look at the color and it's a beautiful looking beer as well. I will always get a trade together to get a hold of some of this. Cheers.
Drank straight from can so I assume it looks as good as it tastes. Very hoppy with full pine/resin hop flavor. Good malt backbone which makes the flavor even more complex. Taste is best as the can warms slightly. Amazing beer
"16oz can. No canning date, but reportedly fresh. I don't do well at following instructions so I poured it into a tulip"
"It was great, but not my favorite ever..."
"Going in depth on this beer doesn't feel necessary, suffice to say it is after several years of narrowing down the IPA field, it is my favorite DIPA and favorite beer. I'm a native vermonter who doesn't have regular access to this anymore, so perhaps I will do a full detailed review when I next have a fresh can."
"Had a Heady Topper. It was the best Hoppy beer I have ever had. I water picked, flossed, and brushed my teeth. I went to bed. I burped in my sleep. I awoke to Christmas in my mouth. It left a lasting impression. I'd love another Heady and will seek one out!"
"With all the hype, I was skeptical. It really measured up. Unfiltered golden color. Volumes of citrusy hop flavor. Long, rich finish. Despite an abv 8% it hours it well. Great beer, no other words for it."
Amazing!!! Want more...but only available in vt!!! The anticipation makes it better
The Elusive Heady Topper... The beer no one can get unless you have knowledge from the locals. This winter I trekked up to Waterbury VT to do some skiing with my gf in nearby Stowe. We knew about this beer prior to the trip but didn't realize just how rare and difficult it was to track down. Shops in Waterbury who stock the brew have special stickers on their doors that designate them as authorized retailers. Can you believe that? It's like an Apple product!
Can drank from can with 2 oz poured into snifter for appearance rating
"I first had this 3/22/15 and rated it a 4.85. If you rated this while drinking it from a glass, I think it would be a 4.25 at best. I don't think I've ever had a beer that changed as much when you took it from the intended vessel to a different one. It really thins out when you put it in a glass. Looks great-cloudy, foamy, some floaties, but it feels weird to rate a beer on appearance when you shouldn't be looking at it. Smell is absolute pure dark hops. It's what a double IPA should smell like. The taste is amazing. It's bold, it's bitter, it's got a mild juiciness and I'd swear there is a light sweetness underneath it. Feel is also amazing – I just want to keep drinking it, as it is smooth and very clean and crisp and the alcohol is strong, but not overpowering. I got two cans of this recently, and I'm regretting promising one of them to a coworker. This is the highest rated beer on the website that I have had, and I would be surprised if the two in front of it were better. A true classic, maybe the best beer I have ever had."
"Was a solid beer that I could drink again, but certainly isn't one of the top beers I've had."
I got two cans via recent IP trade and my understanding is that they were roughly one month old. The first can I opened was not good at all. The second can was like night and day! Really enjoyed the citrusy hops smell. Just not sure this is the #1 beer in the world IMO. If anything I'd like to try some really fresh stuff and see how it compares.
Good good god good good
"great can, smell off the charts, taste is a never ending hop bomb and feel lasts forever. Overall it is worth the hype"
"The hype is real. It's like a hop stew, coating your mouth and leaving an amazing, sticky, resinous, thick hop afterbuzz. I always enjoy from a glass, and it never dissapoints."
Good taste. Strong to strong.
A - More yellow-gold than other DIPAs. Not too much of a head. Nice lacing.
Bought a 4 pack while driving through Vermont. Solid IPA but certainly not the best beer in the world. I don't get the hype.
If you ever have a chance to have this....DO!
Nothing less than excellent. My #2 overall beverage.
"Pours a hazy bright orange with a thick soapy white head. The smell hits with a floral quality but you will get some tropical fruit notes if you really dig your nose in; pineapple, mango, melon, a bit of juicey orange, and a touch of sweetness. That sweetness comes through even more on the taste, almost honey or brown sugar-like, not really your typical malt sweetness. There is some mild fruitiness again, I'd say the best descriptor is ripe cantaloupe but there is some melon, guava, and papaya in there as well. Mouthfeel is soft and sticky, not too much bitterness, the sweetness lingers. Definitely hides the 8% ABV well."
"Drank this beer straight from the can. Aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruit, pomegranate, mango, kiwi, oranges, pine. Taste is wave after wave of hops. Tropical fruits upfront followed by a piney resinous bitterness on the back. Medium body, carbonation is moderate, extremely refreshing at 8.0% abv. "
I love a good hoppy beer and this one is delicious.
seriously the best tasting beer i've ever had
"Straight up hops mishmash, not much more going on - certainly not what I would call a balanced brew. Artificial rarity factor keeps prices high. I've had plenty of DIPA""s that I liked better than this one. Not to say it's not good, but the price is insane. Aroma: hops, hops and more hops. Taste: Hops, hops and more hops."
"Before I go further with this review let me make two caveats: First, the three times I received a can of this brew was from people who traveled to get it, so I don't know how it was kept for the days or weeks before it got to me. Second, I'm not trying to topple a giant, Just trying to give an honest review while trying to follow BJCP guidelines and not let public hype influence my observations... Anywho, let's drink some Heady Topper!!! "
Heady Topper is absolutely lives up to the hype is is one of the world class IPAs without question. Fresh resinous hops with tons of flavor. What is not to love. Cheers!
NOT the best Vermont double IPA.
"Unequivocal, exceptional, renowned, incomparable, in league of its own"
"For me, it lived up to the hype! Juicy hop layers accentuated by strong malt backbone. Deliciousness, straight from the can!"
"This beer recently came through Philly and caused a sensation ! Hope to see more of it. Recommend drinking it straight from the can, as the owner suggests in his video clip. Many thanks to Vermont for an excellent American Double/ Imperial IPA."
"A gift from regular customers, sweeeeeet."
Good brew but a little overrated
"This is my first BA review, but it's definitely not my first beer. I got lucky and went to Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia in search of Pliny the Elder and found out that they were serving Heady Topper. The line for the beer went out the door. It lived up to the hype in a big way. Everything about this beer was phenomenal. The first sip was almost magical. Like the beer was massaging my tongue. Every sip after that got better and better. The only disappointment was when I realized my can was empty. Perfect beer."
"This beer is great... but a little too much hop/bitterness on the finish. Have drank out of can, tulip, and wide mouth. Great smell and look... but not as smooth as I hoped. A bit overrated with the new era of imperials... there are a lot out there that are going to give HT a run for the top spot in the next 12-18 months if production from these micros can get up to speed with demand."
"A few sips in a tulip, majority from the can. Color is slightly opaque gold. It really is very smooth for a double IPA. Nice hoppiness without just being punch-you-in-the-face bitter. Mouthfeel is really nice; creamy foam, not too carbonated. "
Not that great. With exclusivity comes high ratings
"Honestly, I have either received two of the worst cans in the history of mankind, possibly infected, who knows but let's be honest, I tried this once before Sip of Sunshine and Once the following day after drinking Sip of Sunshine. The absolute worst double IPA I have ever had, and this is my favorite style!"
Had a can today at City Tap House (Logan Sq). Drank most of it from the can. Poured off about 4 oz into a taster glass.
Can served directly at a release (I assume quite fresh). 
"Anything in a can gets a Look 5. Philly Welcome Gig at Monk's. Two cans (just to be sure). John was here, but appeared to be busy. I've said ""get some"" before, but this may be the first time for a brew. Get some."
"Definitely lives up to the hype. From the first sip, I noticed some very subtle pine and citrus, which developed into this beautiful buttery-toffee finish. It has sort of an organic mouthfeel which I really dig; could be the fact that it is unpasteurized and unfiltered. Just the right about of bitterness and unique hop flavor to make this extremely satisfying. Killer IPA."
Hop-Dayum!!!!! This beer is the Bees-Knees.
"Poured half into a snifter to get a good look at it, left the other half to be consumed from the can as is suggested by The Alchemist."
Nice. I wouldn't drink from the can. It has some herbal borderline soupy qualities not fond of. Thick and very full bodied. Lacks citrus. Very crushable but this just lacks all the hoppy fruity qualities I want in a double IPA. It's a good beer but I guess I'm spoiled with west coast ipas. I don't get the hype.
A good beer but definitely overrated
"Outstanding beer overall. I enjoy it every time I have it, but it is exceedingly hard to get. I liked it better when I could pick up a four pack or two at the brewery. Alas! No longer!"
Wanted my 50th rating to be a good one. Had a good amount of this brew last year but only shared one since. Hard not to rate it as a 5 across the board. Ridiculously drinkable. An honor to partake!
16oz can poured into Speigelau glass
"Best I've ever tasted. The hops are incredible, but it finishes superbly with no harshness."
"There is a reason this is #1. What an epic DIPA. Worth the trip, the cost, the everything. Still, remember it is just beer. Some people hype it up to be god in a can. Too much hype can be a bad thing. Still, what an amazing brew. Cheers to The Alchemist!"
Poured into a glass.
Flavor seems to change as you get through the can.
"As advertised, one of the greatest beers known to mankind. It was indeed worth all the trouble and cost it took to get my hands on Heady."
"Combination of two separate drinkings. Once from the can, once from a snifter on two separate days."
"This was my first double IPA ever, and it's still the best I've ever had. Can't wait to try it again."
"I find it very unique. The only other DIPA similar that I have had that I can think of was Mastermind. Very cloudy. Not overly hoppy or bitter. Somewhat subtle in the flavor department for what I expected, but very good. Orange, tropical fruits, herbs, earthy, wine like alcohol. Very crisp bite to it. Similar to Hill Farmstead beers in mouthfeel, soft and kind of fluffy. Goes down real easy for an 8% beer"
Amazing drink! Tried it with my brother in San Diego. He was able to get from a coworker that has family in Vermont. Definitely lived up to the hype. 
"Unbelievable balance. My first thoughts were that it's a fantastic beer with incredible hop flavor, but probably not the best beer in the world. However, now when I drink an IPA I realize everything the Topper was and everything the beer I'm drinking isn't."
Soooo damn good. So happy I was able to try it!
Was able to try after a friend visited Vermont. A beautiful beer visually (I cheated and poured into a Spieglau IPA glass.) 
As good as it gets.
"Was lucky enough to have this one at Sam Horne's Hop Rodeo. The only bad thing was, this was the ""mystery beer"" and it was consumed after Pliny The Younger. While it was a very good beer, I believe it's slightly over-hyped. I'm a West Coast IPA guy, so that might also be why. This was good, not great. Both Plinys blow this beer out of the water. But, hey, I got to cross this one off my bucket list. Never thought I'd get this on the West Coast, and glad I did."
"UMMMMMM HEADY.....UMMMMMMM....Give me more. Daddy likes... The only bad thing is that it comes in a can. Otherwise, it would be the perfect 5....Just reflecting on my personal biases"
"The best beer I ever had. Great taste, great buzz."
"Incredible nose and drinks so smooth. The numbness on my tongue after lingered a little more than I wanted, but either way this is a truly incredible beer."
"Not sure if Im just jaded by all of these wonderful west coast ipas at my disposal, or if this just doesnt live up to the hype. Either way, it was just ok imo."
"Amazing beer, but I believe there are many that rival it's flavor, and are much easier to get your hands on."
Gives me a reason to travel to northern Vermont or beg some buddies too. Just can't beat heady!
My 600th Beer Advocate review. Enjoyed on my birthday 02/21/15.
"Unassuming, tasty, a true treat on the palate. Better get in line early if you want some. Many thanks to my great friends who allowed me to indulge in this fantastic offering."
hoppy but not too hoppy bitter but not too bitter ..hands down the best beer I've ever had
Amazing. The best DIPA I have ever tasted. Even better than Pliny the Elder on tap (but not by much).
"Pours a very hazy, cloudy and just plan murky. the color is burnish orange. The head produced was tall with sticky froth that leave plenty of lacing in my glass."
"Murky golden beer with small head. Huge burst of hops flavors, lemon zest, pine in extreme amounts. Aggressive and yet highly drinkable. Lived up to the hype."
"Had out of a can. Drank partially from can and partially from glass. More bite out of the can, but great taste either way. Everything you'd expect an ipa to be....straight fire!"
amazing beer !! must drink from the can
"Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of white head. Big aroma of pineapple, mango, and dank floral notes. Tastes of grapefruit, sweet tropical fruits and then finishes with piney bitterness. Medium mouth with some carbonation. This is such a well-made DIPA."
"Poured from a can, in spite of instructions. Hazy orange, thin head, great aroma. Big, balanced, hoppy. A lovely beer, maybe not the best ever."
"Drank about a third of the beer from the can as recommended. Appearance, from what I saw from the others who poured theirs into cups, was orange-copper in color and topped with a huge head. The aroma was outstanding, citrus and tropical fruits, lots of pine, a little faint malt. Taste is slightly sweet with orange, pineapple, mango flavors. The bitterness comes mid palate featuring pine, citrus peel, and resin. Medium body, thick texture, moderate carbonation, dry bitter finish. Is it worth the Herculean measures to obtain? Maybe not, but a world-class DIPA."
"Lived up to the hype and then some. Best dipa I've had which includes PLE, Hopslam, etc."
This beer reminds me of fresca for some reason. It smells great and has a strong citrus taste and a perfect amount of bitterness to it. 
"This is a perfect example of why I don't like to include ""look"" in a rating. They tell you to drink this from the can for a reason."
Very smooth and well balanced. Definitely a great beer!
"I don't think I have rated anything as high as this one. I honestly looked for defects in this as to not let the legacy of the beer sway my review and suck all objectivity out but damn, it really is worth every penny of hype it receives. What I look for in an IPA is balance. Typically when I get into DIPAs, I tend to relax my search for balance as it is typically replaced by too much sweetness or a touch too much heat (and that's in the best DIPAs I've had) The reason I believe that Heady deserves the critical acclaim is that it has re-written the rules so to speak, for me in approaching the DIPA. Yes, it CAN be well balanced and brilliant within the style. This one opens up with a great nose full of citrus AND pine somehow, without overwhelming on either. Taste follows identically until the sweetness in perfect harmony with the perfectly balanced malt backbone join in and combine every sensation together for one, again, very well balanced taste that finished with just a tiny touch of heat that reminds you that it is a DIPA. Full bodied, well balanced, pretty much every superlative that you can find in describing a great experience in drinking a beer belong here."
"Get my hands on this 1x a month. It's a blessing, this is one great beer, so smoothe and flavors just pop in your mouth. It deserves all of the acclaim, great beer."
"As close to a perfect IIPA as it gets....had the opportunity to have a couple at a restaurant in Burlington, and they delivered on the hype. Everything that can be said about the aroma, taste, and overall experience of this beer has already been said, but needless to say, it comes through. Its ""world-class"" rating is justified."
"I am spoiled to live in Vermont and have ready access to Heady. I think, these days, people hear 'Best in the World' and expect an out of body experience or something. This experience is entirely in the can. I'm sure there are other beers that are objectively as good. I doubt there are any better. This beer won't fix our national deficit, make dogs love cats, or bring back Jimi Hendrix. It will, however dance across the palate in an entertaining way. My advice is to open one and enjoy slowly from the can. The entire flavor profile changes as it warms. I am sure many people have tried Heady that was shipped to them. Getting this beer warm is like feeding a wet Mogwai after midnight. I shipped some to myself when I was on assignment in Texas. It was sent on a Saturday and I got it Monday. Was not the same beer I sent when it arrived. For anyone who has had it this way and reviewed it, I really don't think you got it the way it should be. Oh, and about the can vs glass debate... if you drink it slowly the later complexity is seriously diminished when its been poured into a glass."
Hard to live up to the hype but still great. 
The hype is real.
"It's been said time and time again that this beer is either the best that's ever been had or exceptionally overrated. I suppose the only way to rate it is to hearken back to my initial thought when I took my first sip-- ""how did they fit all of my favorite flavors in this can?"" It really is great. There are many either great beers that measure up, for sure. However, the more popular it becomes the harsher the ratings get. It is what it is, and that's an amazing beer to be enjoyed, not exalted or compared. It's in good company with many other greats that this country is producing. Cheers!"
Great beer but this is a litle over hyped.
"This can may have been old, but I was expecting a lot more."
"Worth the hype. Doesn't have a floral aroma of some other whalez, mouth feel is nothing special, but the taste is as good as it gets."
"This beer is quite easy to get in Vermont with some planning and patience. This would fall within my top three DIPA's I have tasted. Has a great smell, color and taste and awesome finish. Not so sure about drinking it out of the can! I just prefer a snifter style glass versus the can. Only thing better than this beer is Patriots winning the Super Bowl!"
"I broke the rules poured from the can into a pint glass, oh no. First of all this is a really good IPA and I'm glad I drove to Vermont for it. Wonderful piney hop character and solid ABV at 8%. Very smooth too with great aromas and golden color. However I'm not so sure this is really the best IPA in the country. While it's certainly no run of the mill IPA I've had numerous IPAs that would compare to it or even be better. I'll agree with my man coffdaddy in his review, Jai Alai by Cigar City kicks its butt. And the directions were a bit excessive although I've had it from the can as well as a sniffer."
"I've had 3 cases of this stuff to myself now. It is very good. Being from CA, my comparison point is Pliny. They're next to identical in every way, except appearance. Great beer, better out of the can than in it. If you were blindfolded, it'd be hard to tell the difference between the two. As a person that has been fortunate to acquire so much and share it friends, trust me...it's overrated."
"Okay, I've had a bunch of Heady since my initial review here. Since that one was less than 150 characters, let's do one tonight that counts. Can is roughly 2 weeks old. Thanks, Theresa! :)"
I did the half can/half glass experiment and the can was triumphant per my expectations.
"I will admit that I consumed this prior to knowing it was rated #1 in the country, and it definitely was the best I've ever had. I caught a nice buzz that sent the endorphins in high gear from head to toe..need to find more of this."
what an amazing beer starts off with flavors of pine very very piney and then out of nowhere comes a huge grapefruit presence and is very smooth such a great great beer Thank You alchemist you are amazing
"its good, its hoppy but has less of a harsh hop finish. typical grapefruity hop profile but nicer finish. i like ipa's but don't love them. higher carbonation which i believe is increased because you have to drink from the can...so i poured half of it into a glass. i like it better since it's easier to drink. i got to say, for me its a 4.5 out of 5. (maybe less but i think i will be thrown out of any bar if i say that)"
This is a fantastic double IPA. I just wish it was easier to find ... just had another and think it was even more delicious that the last one!
The best of the best. Puts all other beer to shame
Great citrus and floral hops up front. It has enough of a malt backbone to sustain it. Definitely lives up to the hype.
My first 5; I feel justified in the rating. Everything is firing on all cylinders.
"It backs all the hype, best DIPA I have ever had."
"Lives up to all the hype. Wonderful aroma with notes of florals and citrus, and goes down incredibly smoothly. The extremely limited distribution and difficulty of acquisition of this beer certainly adds to the mystique/reputation. But the beer does stand on its own merits."
Best IPA beer in VT. Had it while I was on vacation there and it's really hard to get. Can't wait to visit the brewery in 2016.
Very smooth and well balanced but complex
The greatest beer in the USA hands down
Been fortunate to have access to this beer over the past few years....still amazes me...continues to be the best.
"I actually liked this better from a glass than the can. Furthermore it apparently no longer has the disturbing pulpy appearance of years past, and looks pretty good. Just a cloudy orange color, nice foamy head and all that. Definitely lives up to its reputation but I have to say if you don't have access to this, New Glarus Scream is pretty darn similar in taste."
"Thank you to my friend Matt for bringing this down to nyc. What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is one of the best beers I've ever had and clearly it's one of the best ever made. Mine was 6 days old. Sensational hoppy taste with some fruity notes, strong but drinks very easily. I poured a tiny smidge into a glass just to see the golden/amber beer- but of course drank the rest from the can. Can't wait to drink another"
"Lives up to the hype. Great dipa. Hazy golden. 2 fingers of head, lacing sticks forever. Spicy fruit, loads of hops. It's a world class beer. Glad to have tried it"
"Enjoying the last Heady of my 4-pack tonight... from the can, obviously. This is easily one of my top 2 favorite beers. The hoppy, citrus flavor makes this beer incredibly easy-drinking. Its a game-changer. Can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"I was lucky enough to trade for some of these fine IPAs with a friend and colleague on the east coast (Canada, no less). "
Tried this once and it was delicious. Would love to get my hands on more.
Gotta start with gratitude. Much love and big thanks to @Roguer for sending this one along in the BIF box I received. Awesome.
One of the top rated beers ever and I finally go my hands on some thanks to Drizzew5! I wanted to truly see this beer so I did pour it; sorry Alchemist.
for not being an IPA guy this definitely hit the top of my list of favorite IPAs. it's lived up to the hype in my mind. I haven't tried the infamous Maine Lunch. But it's solid....
I've been lucky enough to have a few of these. I'll need a few more.
"Tried for the can and poured into a pint glass. Just OK, PtE beats it every day."
"Though I don't follow the IPA craze, this beer, especially fresh, is the best balanced use of heavy hops I've ever encountered. It deserves it's high place"
"Out of all the IPAs I have tasted, which is my favorite style of beer, this is a close second to Maine Beer Lunch. Just to add, honestly, drink it from the can! This beer starts, well sits on the palate well and finishes well; wish it was easier to find, it would be THEE go-to for me."
I wish my farts didn't smell so bad after drinking this gift from the gods
I drank some from the can and poured the rest to see it. 
"L - nice can, yellowish orange body, opaque, two finger head fades slowly"
"I've never actually seen it, as I ""followed the rules"" on the few instances I've had the pleasure, so this is based on what I assume it must look like."
"Been wanting to try this for a while, boy did it not disappoint. Had a family friend bring home a case from Vermont. By far the best DIPA I have ever had."
Best beer in all America! Perhaps in all the world!
Pours a clear golden color with some head that disappears rather quickly.
"Poured a little into a sample glass for smell and color, hazy light straw color. Smooth hop scent. "
"Sad that I tried this, because I know I will never have again. Is it the best beer in the world I did not think so but it was a GREAT beer and deserves to be thought of as one of the best."
"Great beer, but recently moving from the west coast to the east coast, I felt it was too hyped up. 3-way from a group of oregon breweries, brother from Fremont, and top cutter from bale breaker from Washington state were just as good in their own ways. West coast IPA vs East/English coast IPA I guess. Still would drink it over most beers of offered."
Always ready for a Heady.
One of the best beers consumed by me in 2014.
Was skeptical of how good this could really be AND wow....Heady Topper lived up to the hype. Pretty much ruined every other beer I had the rest of the night.
"Given the new rating system, I felt compelled to add a review to my score, even though this beer speaks for itself by now."
Believe the hype. This is the truth.
i drank it straight from the can as i was told to do. this beer was really hoppy and delicious. i have one more can and i'm going to drink it ASAP.
"Can got provided by Steve, thank you very much!"
"Without question the best beer I've ever tasted. Look, smell, taste all equate to perfection. Heady is Legend!"
"L: a semi bright yellow/orange, some floating sediment, and a nice bright white head"
This is one of those beers that lives up to the hype. The smell is similar to other DIPA's but the taste is fantastic. The smooth citrusy hops stand out on their own and is something I will compare all other's in this category.
"Smell smells like a medicinal weed shop. First sip was from the can. Really dank hoppy taste. Really hoppy and no malts. Rest of the beer was poured into a glass. The pour was perfect. I didn't even need to aggressively pour into the glass. From the glass, the beautiful smell goes away but the taste of the beer is still the same. Still tastes hoppy but I wish it was alittle more sweeter. It is like a less malty pure hoppiness from alpine beer company. Only two problems, one is that the carbonation goes away fast, second is that the finish falls flat. I think pure hoppiness is a lot better than this"
"Heady is a great beer, completely different from the west coast IPAs. Hazy, yellow color, great hop aroma, nice malt balance. Not my favorite Vermont IPA, though. (Double Sunshine)."
"16oz can purchased on 7/20 and poured (yeah, yeah, yeah) into a Spiegelau glass. Pours a beautiful hazy, orange color with about a finger of head dissipating to a nice ring. Smell is citrusy grapefruit and the taste does not disappoint. Near perfect mouthfeel and finish. Definitely this hop lover's favorite DIPA."
"From the reviews I read, I was a little disappointed. Maybe my tastebuds were dulled from an evening of enjoyment."
Appearance: pours a light honey color. a small half-finger to finger of a foamy white head with good retention and a solid lacing. completely hazy and opaque.
"To me, this lives up to the hype. Obviously some of the built-in hype is due to this beer's exclusivity to the VT region but I still think its fantastic. Its one of the most refreshing DIPA's I have ever tasted, I could easily sit back and have a couple of these on a hot summer afternoon. Fantastic brew."
Too over hyped. I think people rate this beer to high
"Very good double IPA, not quite at the top echelon of the style but very close. The appearance of the beer is extremely cloudy, bordering on chunky. Aroma is amazing with dank, piney, and fruity hops all interplaying with the yeast esters. The flavor is a little bit coarse and unrefined, but super hoppy and delicious. Body is fairly dry, appropriate to the style. Overall, this is like a hoppy punch to the face!"
"Finally got a can, thanks Jim. Took the first sip from the can, as directed, but had to pour into a pint glass to rate. Poured a hazy medium straw color. Overwhelmingly wonderful aroma. The taste was nice at first, maybe felt a little thin on the palate, but each sip got better. Small head with minimal retention, light lacing. This beer is all about the aroma and flavor. Piney earthy aromas and flavors. Very much a New England example of an American DIPA, in the same ballpark of the Gandhi Bot. Goes down very easy for an 8% beer. If I could get this beer regularly, I would have it prominently featured in the regular rotation."
Hoppy beer tasty Nice local Vermont beer
I can say this beer has won hands down
Still my favorite. Even with all the hype.
"Fuzzy, juicy, incredibly aromatic, delicious stuff."
"A complete, we'll rounded, hopped up mofo...I wish I could use a better adjective than superlative and enjoyed as directed from the can."
Best beer I've ever had. Amazing. Must have. Very hard to find.
Not sure how fresh this can I got from a friend who got from a friend but Im extremely glad I finally got to try this beer. Stamp for manu date didnt make sense. 
My favorite beer of all time. Looking for a challenger
"Was a skeptic until I had one. I remember thinking ""why can't they all taste like this"" Unreal."
great beer! wish I could find it here in CT. gonna have to go to Vermont soon!
"Best IPA I've tried, by far. Sculpin by Ballast Point was comparable, but Heady Topper had the most fragrant nose and ever-changing taste I have had the chance to experience. Worth the two and a half hour drive (one-way), for sure. Drinking out of the can, as recommended, I only noted its light, creamy yellow color towards the end. Very smooth, and definitely not the most bitter IPA (as they admitted on the can), but I would have to agree with the brewer; ""sometimes I wish I could crawl into the can."""
It's like drinking from a pine tree.
A: Cool can art. Now that's a hophead. For the sake of this review I am disregarding the drink from can directions and inserting in glass.
Awesome. It's up there as the best DIPA I have ever had.
Got to have it fresh.
Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing
"Phenomenal beer, even my dog enjoys it!"
"Smells like a edible bouquet of beer sunflowers that are grown by nude supermodels, potted in pots of water and wads of freshly printed cash , watered with Chuck Norris's sweat and bathed in moonbeams relfected off of a golden unicorn. "
"Very good IPA, had along side a Pliny Elder and both stood up strong. Color slightly hazy, smell not very strong, but great taste."
"Drank one a year ago without knowing all the hype about it (hotel bar). Found it good the first time, better the second. Incredible taste."
Every mouthful was different...I am really going to need to try another just to analyze the different hop tastes. Probably the most complex beer I've ever had. It was a truly amazing experience.
"I have been a big fan of IPA beers for over a year and have sampled at least 15 of the top IPAs. I finally made it up to Stowe for skiing and got a chance to try the famous Heady Topper. I could not have have been more disappointed. There is nothing extraordinary about this IPA whether you drink from the can or pour in a glass. Stone Enjoy By is by far much better than HT. If you have gotten hands on that one, not need to hunt down HT at least in my opinion."
I finally had the legendary IPA Heady Topper it meet all the expectations I had going into it.
Worth the hype? Oh yeah! This is probably the best smelling and best tasting beer in its class I have ever had. 
"This is currently, my all-time favorite Imperial IPA. Thank goodness for a very generous brother-in-law who travels to Vermont! Cheers!"
Delightful fresh IPA. I got a case and followed the instructions.... mostly... I poured one into a pint glass. Nice smooth head. It has a bright aroma and a smooth mouth feel. I will buy and drink another case when I get the chance. 
"Tough call on this beer. I received two fresh cans overnight that were both kept cold the entire time. One can tasted awesome, but the second had a smoky almost burnt flavor to it. I've talked to a friend that had a similar experience. My rating would be much higher if both cans had tasted the same."
A: very cloudy pale. Nice white head but very minimal lacing
"This review is based on a couple of years of consuming heady on a fairly regular basis. When I first tried heady I was blown away at the freshness of the beer and the overall package the beer brought. There have been a couple of times that I had heady and it was not what it had been or what I was expecting, consistently good but never mind blowing as it once was."
"Poured half the can into an ipa glass and savored the rest in the can. Beautiful looking beer with a great pillow-cap fluffy head that seemed to last quite awhile. The aroma of lemony tangerines and grapefruit is delightful. Real easy to drink, the 8% not noticeable, and the smoothness is ridiculous! Tastes like the aroma but probably even better! Also I enjoyed the lack of a bitter aftertaste. To summarize; Heady Topper was the most wonderful and amazing IPA I have had to opportunity to try. The hype is well deserved and all my expectations were met! Well done indeed."
"Drink out of a can, do not pour :) SO delicious!"
perfection in an IPA2. Not like anything else. Not bitter. Fruit forward but not fruity. Amazing.
"Outstanding and lives up to the hype. Good luck finding it, they closed the brewery to tours due to traffic backing up the exit ramp."
Followed the instructions given…drank from the can and recycled.
One of the things that upset me the most about leaving Vermont and moving to Massachusetts... Now I have to drive 3 hours to search it out... But well worth the drive....
Lived up to the hype!
"Ok being an IPA lover for many years Iv wanted to try this for ever! my amazing girlfriend just got 2 4packs for me for christmas,I got it 2 days early! :)"
"The most perfectly balanced IPA I have ever had. Pours pretty thick with a strong head. Smells very earthy with nice hop aromas. Waves of flavors from sweet to citrus with a crisp dry finish and never wrecks your palette. I went out of may way to tried not to buy into the hype. But in the end it won me over, best beer I have ever tasted."
"A brilliant, complex, and stunning DIPA on all accounts. Strong scent of pine, earth, floral aromas, and fragrant, fresh hops. The taste slams your palate against a hop wall that gives way to citrus, pine, peach, and genius hop flavor. These multiple flavors surf across the palate to settle into a lovely, magnificent finish. I'd compare the taste to a crashing hop wave that opens the palate with its startling, ingenious complexity. "
"It's amazing beer advocate changed the rating system. Now, only ratings That come with a review of 150 characters will count. They've now just discounted thousands of ratings just because they want ""quality"". Well guess what, you now have a smaller sample size and beers with only 159 ratings are cracking the top 20. So stupid. It's 2015, people are busy. I don't want to spend 10 minutes describing my feelings about every beer I drink!"
"Friend of mine turned me on to this beer and I absolutely love it, brought it to me young and it was a super refreshing flavorful beer."
"This is hands down my favorite beer. My buddy often works in Vermont and we are always requesting Heady Topper. It can make a bad day awesome, an awesome day awesomer. It is just a great thing to look forward to."
"Received as an extra, (thanks Buford), and was excited as I was looking for this beer."
Tastes amazing an lives up to the hype. Sometimes hype can ruin something...it doesn't ruin this.
This is the best overall beer I have ever have. More than lives up to the hype. 3 weeks old. Just unreal
Poured it (I know) into a Parish mini snifter
"Drank from the can as requested by The Alchemist. The anticipation of getting this beer lead to a little bit of an expectation that I didn't necessarily get from drinking this; however, I still think this is a stellar beer and will never turn it down!"
Poured into a Duvel tulip from a can. (yes it says drink from can and I will with my next one and post it in this review also)
What more can I say about Heady Topper that hasn't been said before? Amazing tropical hoppy flavors that just explode from the can. Amazing!
"After all the newfangled juice bombs coming out of VT/NE these days, I'll be darned if Heady still ain't king. You want to know why? Because it tastes and smells like a fucking IPA. It doesn't taste like a glass of orange juice. It doesn't smell like a Bath and Body Works display counter. I repeat: It tastes and smells like a fucking IPA. Sure, there are some really nice mango notes in the nose, a touch of dankness too. Sure, the palate has some tropical fruits, some clean, well-done malt, and an excellent level of bitterness to ground the brew. But this is a sum of all parts beer -- all the pieces work together to create, well, an IPA. Heavy is the Heady that wears the crown, but it's still the jewel of the NE."
"Great beer. Super hoppy, but a great drinker."
Brother bought me a case for my fiftieth birthday. He drove up three hours one way to a store in Northern Vermont as the truck was arriving. They had sold out before he left with his share. 
"I truly believe this is and always will be the best beer available. If you love a perfect IPA, this is it. It's a perfect balance of hops, bitterness, and malt. There's a crisp-ness in the mouthfeel that I've never been able to find in any other IPA. All I can do is hope John Kimmich at Alchemist produces more. I work all year to trade and acquire Heady. It's perfect."
Pours a sunshine yellow with a very subtle orange/yellow hue. Medium-heavy carbonation and a rich lathery head of foam.
"Still remains my favorite beer out there since the time I've had it four years ago. Absolutely no way to be mad at this beer. If you don't like IPA's, I urge someone to take a step outside their box and have a HT. Drink this beer out of the can, very few places will tap this beer. ""Don't be a DB."" Try it."
Absolutely delicious. Tastes great with anything. Seriously. I now take the 2 hour drive twice a year to stock up.
I get all the hype. It is a delicious beer. Part of the mystique is due to limited distribution though. I get it a few times per season. Best for a crisp winter day during a pond hockey set break.
Happy to try this for a second time - many thanks to a generous colleague. 
"I hate to be cliche, but this is definitely my new favorite IPA. The flavor was incredible, and the aftertaste is just perfect. This is the perfect beer for me."
An absolute favorite.
"Best. Beer. Ever. This beer, right in the first sip, is like fireworks in your mouth. And each subsequent sip is simply better than the last."
More hype than taste for me.
Just joined BA so I rating all the beers I love.
Just a world class IPA. great flavors that really bring out the different hops used. I;d get a 2nd.
its a perfect beer. really is has everything you want from an iipa. drove 8hrs round trip to get a case and ready to do it again asap!
Enough hop and alcohol which makes it my best double ipa.
Excellent. Both nose and taste hits you like no other
5/5 
This is a work of art. Big thanks to metsfan1 for the trade. this is now the standard bearer for me for any ipa from the east coast. Or damn near anywhere for that matter. Believe the hype.
"November 29, 2014"
"From the can in Burlington Vt. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, mango, peach. Flavors come through like the nose. Pretty epic. Taste follows the nose to a T. It's an explosion of hops, starting sweet and fruity and slowly building bitterness the more you drink it. Worth the hype? I think so. Is it the best beer in the world I ever had? I don't know, but its right up there and damn close. Glad I got my hands on it."
"My only gripe is the whole drink from a can...I'm not buying that. However, this is by far and above my favorite beer to date. The perfect balance of hops and malt for my palate. Although hop forward, there isn't that strange aftertaste associated with some overtly hoppy beers. The alcohol seems non-existent. Notes and tastes of citrus (grapefruit in particular) meet a creamy and well-rounded pine."
"Just like everyone else says... It's awesome... Best straight from the can like it says... Best fresh as well, even though it's still delicious after a couple of weeks.. Definitely a beer you must try at least once.."
Dank tasty brewski
"Better from the tap than the can, but still the kitty's titties all around."
"Dank and piney, with a little citrus in the background. Well balanced and very drinkable. Drunk half in the can and half in the glass. I prefer the glass. Delicious."
"This was honestly fantastic beer (better than I anticipated, I thought it would be over rated). Best in the world?... to hard to quantify but this beer pushes perfection. I will say, I had two cans shipped to me, had the first out of a can and the second out of a glass (because I like to look my beer in the eyes while I sip it) it was better out of the can, though I also had it 3 weeks fresher from the can. Somehow this beer manages to have a serious hop punch that still feels balanced."
Very citrusy on the nose. Pours a cloudy light orange. Very very light with a nice citrus hop bite. Really refreshing for a DIPA
"Heady topper pours a hazy golden orange (I prefer it from the glass, despite what is written on the can). Smell and taste are citrus and some bitterness, less tropical fruit than other New England style ipas. Mouth fee is spot on. Overall, deserving of its high ratings."
Amazing! Had it in Boston from a local mom and pop beer store! Amazing Aroma full flavor! Will buy/trade for again!
"This is a tremendous double IPA, but I don't put it on the same level with some other Vermont hoppy offerings, such Focal Banger, Sip of Sunshine, and Abner. Heady is a touch too malty and sweet for me, but still a wonderful brew."
Phenomenal hoppy finish
Smooth one of the best IPA I've had.
"Are you kidding? This is the nectar of the beer Gods. The hype is real, my expectations have been met and exceeded. If you want a breakdown of the subtle nuances, look at all the other reviews. This was 6 or 7 day old beer, and if you are lucky like me and get 4 of them, by all means drink it from the can as recommend, when poured into a glass the flavor seemed diminished. Enjoyed!!"
"Would I stand for several hours in line hoping to grab a case of the highly sought after The Alchemist#HeadyTopper... No! However, this imperial IPA may be one of the best IPAs I have tried from the Northeast. The aroma reminds me of fresh squeezed orange juice & the palate is an assassination of hops! Grapefruit, orange, mango, lemongrass & fresh resinous marijuana. This IPA's personality is vibrant, flavorful, assertive and bone dry. But somehow, the danky aroma & the aggressive bitterness find a way to coexist as one. If a friend or someone offers one up.. Take it because it worth trying and experiencing. #craftbeer"
Poured a little of this out into a snifter just to see color and get some smells. The rest will be drank from the can as demanded.
The ultimate IPA
"Its the complete package. Had my first can last night at One Mile House which they were serving for their anniversary. Actually ordered a Maine Lunch first upon seeing it on their extensive beer list. They have it on tap. After taking my first sip I noticed the guy next to me drinking a Heady Topper out of the unmistakable can. I was shocked and immediately order one - now double fisting a heady topper and a main lunch. The rest is between me and my taste buds, but all of the accolades here are spot on."
The best beer by far ever brewed.
Type: 16-oz. can
Was lucky enough to take a trip up to Stowe and Burlington last weekend. As a non-hophead this is incredibly drinkable. The bitterness does not destroy your tastebuds like most DIPAs and the taste is fantastic. I came across it in a liquor store later in the day and bought the limit for an individual.
Well this beer was everything i hoped for and more. Definitely lives up to all of the hype. Perfect balance of fruit and bitterness from the hops and the malt profile balances them out perfectly. don't know if there will ever be a more balanced beer then this. its everything i wish for in an IPA
When Fresh (within 10 days) best IPA ever!
"Pours a hazy honey orange with 2 finger white head. Smells floral, orange/grapefruit. Tastes of sweet orange blossom,grapefruit, sweet malt and pine. Silky medium/full body with medium carbonation. Leaves a great hop resin in mouth and lips and back of throat. Incredible beer."
Not sure how my prior rating was at 4.75. This beer was easily one of the best I have had to date.
The last of days arrived.
Love this beer. Great citrus hop one of the best beers ever
"Worth the wait, meets the hype"
Never did I think something so amazing could come from a can. I love this beer.
"This smells fantastic, very hoppy and aromatic, but I find it a bit too bitter for my tastes."
Had in glass and from can. Better from can (that is a minus).
A true double IPA. Hard to get unless you wait in line for around an hour or better during the week. Smooth from start to finish and be sure to listen to the can and drink from it
"Got this on trade. I know it says drink from the can, but I poured it slowly into a glass. Looks like grapefruit juice. Big resin, grapefruit, and tropical fruit aroma. Very tasty. Lots of grapefruit taste. Good bitter punch. So juicy. Hints of orange and other citrus taste. Totally amazing beer."
Perfect example of an ipa. So much aroma and citrus flavors especially grapefruit up front. No lingering bitterness. So drinkable i drank 10 in one night. One of the few beers that lives up to the hype
"Quite simply, the gold standard of IPA. Intensely hoppy, yet effortlessly drinkable. Pure balance. The more double IPA's I try, the more I appreciate Heady."
Surprisingly clean finish without sacrificing flavor. Pleasant IPA. Hoppy & creamy.
Hard to live up to the hype but this beer came through in a big way. Couldnt ask for a better beer
Quit reading reviews and just find this beer the best you can. It is hop heaven in a can!
Slightly overrated but not by much! I'm more of a citra/citrus light bodied ipa guy though. Still a FANTASTIC beer!
Just bad ass.....was able try a few this year (friends that built a home up in VT) It was all that was promised. Won't disappoint.... Unless you're not an IPA guy.....but don't even waste it on those folks ;)
"Had on tap at Alchemist and from can, prefer the can due to hop aroma being more pronounced. "
Don't see the big deal here. Very similar to many other citrusy DIPA's with a little creaminess to it.
Amazing hop nose and surprisingly smooth drinking. Grapefruit throughout with a dry finish. The abv hides behind how tasty it is and then it punches you in the face after your second.
Good but highly overrated beer.
Poured with Jake_ramrod on Halloween. Thanks for the scary share.
the beer by which i judge all beer
"Acquired in trade. Extremely easy drinking brew that packs quite the punch of flavor at the front of the tongue. Booze is well hidden. It is crazy how easy drinking this beer is. World class, but falls a close 2nd to Pliny."
"The best IPA, EVER. Worth the 2 1/2 hour wait. I recommend all Hop heads to try this if they can get their hands on some. This brewery knows what supply & demand is all about. Two thumbs up!"
Glowing hazy yellow with a thick head. 
Not much more to say than what's been said. Stands tall in the world of DIPA's and is amazing on tap and excellent in the can. Not my favorite DIPA but in the top 10.
"I finally got the chance to experience the best. The beer was really good but not my favorite. I finally have accepted that cans are good for beer but I still enjoy them in an appropriate glass. I did as told and enjoyed this one straight from the can. Other getting to show off my prize, I did not care for the can experience. "
"After all the trouble of getting it, I fully intended to pace my way through the case. Somehow though, I can't usually bring myself to drink something else when there's a cold Heady in the fridge."
"Out of the can as instructed. Great, consistent hoppy flavor. Terrific enhancer of sharp cheddar resting on tongue. Makes cheese pop and the finish of this ADIPA holds up. Very drinkable."
Absolutely everything you'd expect
"For me this is my favorite DIPA, It was my first experience with a DIPA and the one I compare others to."
The best beer I ever had. Simply wonderful.
Let me start this review by saying: it's been a long time coming and much anticipated to finally get my hands on this gem!!!! 
"one of the best beers in a can, hands down."
I need more!
16 oz can purchased at Craft Beer Cellar in Waterbury. Drank the first can in my hotel room and poured the second into a snifter just to see the color.
Pours a glowing orange somewhat hazy tint. One of the brightest beers I've ever seen in the glass. Smell is unlimited sweet citrusy hops. So incredibly sweet on the nose. Like hoppy candy. The taste is awesome. Great bursts of citrusy west coast hops but also a good bit of pine. Surprisingly balanced in terms of hop profile. Mouthfeel is pretty standard of a DIPA. Smooth and well carbonated. Overall this is such a great beer. Maybe not the greatest beer of all time but defimtiely something I wish I could keep in my fridge at all times.
"Huge beer with an enticing nose and massive, complex flavor. Ignoring the print around the top of the can, ""Drink From the Can,"" I poured this into my usual tasting glass and enjoyed the soft aromas of bitter orange, sweet malt and citrus, with spicy and earthy notes. The flavor was intriguing and seemed perfectly balanced."
Simply the standard for a DIPA.
"Everybody wants to make the next heady topper. Or the heady killer. And nobody can because the alchemist made the prototype east coast IPA before anyone else could beat them to it. Massive juicy citrus hops all up in your face. Hazy and beautifully bright golden in appearance. Mouthfeel is superb, very soft but still really well carbonated. Lacks the bitter dank finish of west coast styles but that's why people love it. Get your hands on a heady and your taste buds will be rewarded."
Had Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder side by side... Both are equally awesome
"Pint can poured into a pint glass (because I wanted to look at it). No date that I can see -- but purchased a week ago today, and flown home in a friend's luggage. Another gift from him that elicited a nerdy gasp of delight when I found it on my desk."
"After driving all day through winding Vermont by-roads with my wife (she wasn't a problem, but endless construction was) and waiting in a long-ass line at Beverage Baron, you bet I was going to pour this into a glass. I could smell tangy hops as soon as I cracked the can, which was a good sign."
"Had this a few years back and did a 5 rating, back when you could just scroll an select a single rating. Got a 4-pack via trade. Gotta say, the 5 stands. This beer is soooo good. Immediately after finishing the last one, I was scheming on how I could get some more. The beer is very hazy in color, golden almost. Smells like a helicopter crashed in a gigantic field of hops and the blades spun around for 10 minutes. Taste is so unique: You do, as the can says, get wave after wave of hop flavor washing over your palate. Man, it is so delish. Feel is also fantastic. I can't wait to get me some more of this."
"I really am not a fan of this new ""ratings"" system. However if the only way for my rating to count is to review, so be it. This is what the gold standard should be for a DIPA. Magnificent in every way."
Skunky before you even taste it olfactory is in overdrive.
"16 oz can... 1/2 drank from can (as directed), 1/2 from tulip"
"Well.... i live here in the great state of vermont. And i can get heady topper pretty much whene ever i want (im a chef, always have the stuff). This is a good IPA. I like it for its culture shock and I respect its cult folowing, however i actually do not like the beer. Its unbalanced, and dry hopped way to long for my taste. As a chef im always looking for balence and this just does not have it. But i do understand why hop heads around the country flock for it."
Awesome do have 12 fresh ones for trade
Smuggled some Cans down to my surf lodge in Nicaragua. YEAH BUDDY!
"Amazing brew. I've had around 12, and only drank one out of the can. Shun me!"
So glad to have gotten ahold of some of this beer. It's the perfect DIPA
What can be said that has not already been said... just get your hands on one
"On a trip up north to Vermont I realized I was in Heady topper country. I honestly wanted not to like this beer based on the fact everybody likes it. I thought the limited access was the majority of the reason it was so desirable. Expecting a normal IPA with some deviations I can say I was dead wrong. It was like nothing else I've had before but so familiar to my favorite hoppy IPA style. I was a little unsettled about drinking it out if the can but got used to it after the third one. The first thing I did was smell the hoppy aroma which was great. The beer was excellent, a dank, hoppy, piney, citrusy IPA with a more heavy mouthfeel. Very complex If I could buy this I would always have a 4 pack in my fridge. But I'm from NY and the beer doesn't travel far. I tried 5 or 6 different stores the alchemist website states it delivers to and all the stores sell out in hours to a single day. A bartender hooked me up with two cans after a couple of hours of drinking and chatting. It's not easy to obtain this brew making me want it more. The two in my fridge are killing me right now I'll be sure to give one to a real beer guy friend who knows his hops and has been around the beer isles. This will not be wasted on a bud light drinker I promise"
"Tap and 16 oz can. Very good IPA, especially when had fresh from the tap at the brewery. Delightful citrus/hop flavor that isn't overpowering. Get this if you can."
16oz Can.
"Well I finally had a chance to try the infamous Heady Topper. A friend was working in Vermont and came across a 4 pak at, of all places, a gas station convenience store. Well, with great anticipation, we sat down at my home bar, popped the top on a can and away we went. First thing to hit you was the aroma. Piney, hoppy. And that's where it ended for me. This beer is better suited to be an air freshener than a drink. I was sitting there tasting what in my opinion is way over the top flavor finished with bitterness. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. With all of the thousands of beers in the world this is the # 1? Not a chance. In the end I felt like a kid who got a beautifully wrapped gift only to discover a bag of sox or underwear inside. What a bummer."
This beer is so unique and exceptional that it's hard for me to figure out how it was concocted.
Deserves it's number one rating. This is one of the great beers of all times. It redefines the IPA category. Very juicy and aromatic. The alcohol is well hidden.
"It really is unique and fabulous. I've had a ton, and it does vary in quality from time to time, but has never been anything lower than ""great"". Seriously, the worst I've had is still very delicious. I've had hundreds of cans, had many a sampler from the brewery when it was open and also had on draft several times. All good stuff."
Yeah. I could drink this all day. And night. And day again...
A quick review as I didn't take tasting notes and had a few days ago. Drank from a 16 ounce can poured into a pint beer glass and drank with friends after a 10K race.
"I was fortunate to try this beer twice thanks to a good friend. Once when it was ranked #3 back in 2011 or 2012 when I was still a novice beer drinker and had no idea what dIPA beer was or how it was suppose to taste. Now after trying over 200+ beers I would say my taste for beer has developed alot more esp. enjoying Sours, IPAS, and any stouts barrel aged I cam to appreciate this beer much more. Loved the aromas and taste of all the hops and flavors delivered from "
"When the can says to not use a glass you gotta wonder. Having tried it both ways, the can is right. This is a perfectly balanced DIPA. Layers and waves of hops. Strong malty backbone. Spot on carbonation and weight. A huge thanks to my great beer buddy Chris Brady for the four pack of this exceptional beer. I could drink this all day. No trace of the abv, sneaky drinkability. WOW."
"Appearance: I drank most from the can, as directed, but did cheat and poured into a glass."
"Heady is delicious - no doubt about it. I wouldn't say it lives up to the hype like Double Sunshine or Abner, but it's definitely not a disappointment either. I'm drinking my 8th can as I type this FYI."
"I can see why they only made this for a while. One of the best beers for sure. I had it on draft a couple times in VT and it lives up to the pretty much lives up to the hype. Hazy and orange in the glass. Odor of citrus, pine and tropical fruit. Taste follows odor with a great balance of hops throughout. Never over powering, well balanced. Ends nice and dry. Overall, an excellent ipa and an outstanding beer."
"Perfect combination of bread sweetness, Citrusy hops and sweet alcohol. The greatest dip around"
Worth the hype and the flavor and aroma makes this one of the best DIPA's ever made.
BEST BEER I've ever had
Perfection in a can.
"At the time of this review, Heady topper is ranked on Beer Advocate as the best beer in the world. I was up at Stowe in Vermont for a british car show and found a bar that served this infamous beer on tap. Overall, if I didn't know this beer was so highly ranked, I would have thought Its alright, but not memorable in the least. If anything, all the flavors are very well balanced. The only decreeable flavor i could pick out was mandarin orange. I think this would be a nice session beer, but this is absolutely not a memorable beer. For all the hype, this was a letdown as there's nothing memorable, special or unique about it. FWIW, I'm also not really an IPA guy."
"One does not simply quaff Heady Topper. It needs to be enjoyed with complete awareness and yet total relaxation, in the fullness of time, each sip a journey to an exotic Roger Dean-esque alien landscape, where you sit beneath a strangely geometric tree, listening to the far-off flesh-eating birds chirping, and think, ""This couldn't get any weirder. Well, maybe if I were tripping, too."""
"What is most striking to me about Heady Topper is the smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The hop aroma and flavor are fresh, bright and juicy. The bitterness is about perfect. But to me it's that mouthfeel that is most distinctive. Well, that and the large amount of beautiful yeast sediment that you can culture from any can."
Solid. Not cool I have to drive 3 hours to get!
This beer changed my life.
One of my favorite Double IPA's!
One of the best DIPA's I've ever had the privilege of drinking. For a DIPA to have so many aromas and tastes mingle so well with no one of them overpowering the others is a testament to the brewers. Tough to get but worth the effort.
"A review is meaningless, there's nothing to complain about unless you haven't had it before, in which case you are most definitely doing something wrong. So dank, so heady. "
"First sampled Sept 2014 at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT as part of an epic flight* (Heady, Edward, Sip of Sunshine, and Conehead); revisited today (April 3 2015) courtesy of a trade with one of our local ski club members who had the presence of mind to buy a CASE while he was up that way."
"A good but overrated DIPA. Good hops profile and a solid malt backbone but nothing about it was overly impressive. As has been said in many other BA reviews before, I've had better IPAs and DIPAs. Maybe the cans I have aren't the freshest? Honestly, if it had a wide distribution I believe this beer would drop out of the top 10 on the BA 250. Does anybody remember Westy 12 being #1 a couple years ago? After their 12/12/12 release in the US that beer has steadily moved down to #12. I certainly won't seek out Heady again unless it's straight from the brewery."
best dipa there is going
This is a perfect IPA. World Class!
"If the color and head are not impressive enough, the taste is dazzling. Grapefruity, hoppy, raw, full, malty, bitter, smooth are some of the many descriptions that come to kind. A great and complex drink. I am usually jot an IPA fan, but thia beer is in a class of its own."
"I still prefer Pliny, but this IPA still blows me away. It is better straight from the can, but I usually like getting the aroma from a beer while drinking it."
World class. Finding one can be a bit tricky though. My friend got me one at a phish concert but I was left with a feeling of disappointment. I think they had allowed it to get warm which affected the taste. I then took a trip to Vermont and headed straight for Waterbury. I thought it would be easy to find once I got to the home town but I may as well have been in California. I struck gold at the best Western hotel I stayed at because their cafe had some in stock. I did end up finding some to bring home after following multiple leeds taking me to multiple towns.
"Had half from the can, half poured in a glass, just couldn't resist."
Had this twice! Soo soo good! I wish it wasn't so hard to get a hold of in California. Where all my beer geeks at?? I need this in California!
"Purchased on 8/21 and 8/22. Some of the cans tasted amazing and others not that remarkable. In the cans that were less than remarkable, I observed what I think is an usual amount of air space between the top of the can and the top of the beer inside the can. In terms of volume, it was approximately a 1 ounce void in a 16 ounce can. In these cans the bottom of the tab, once opened, barely touched the top of the beer. I found myself wondering if this air space contributed to off flavors, mainly because the cans I thought tasted amazing were full of beer - no air void in the can. It's a solid beer and it's fun to stand in line for it, but each time I head to VT I find myself more impressed with other VT offerings and less impressed with Heady."
"Very nice, dank and piney aroma and taste. Very balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Only downside for me is the lack of some tropical fruit and the alcohol being just a bit too present."
"I'll preface this by saying I was incredibly skeptical of this beer. I was in Vermont and couldn't pass it up. Everyone kept telling me it was the greatest thing ever, all I could think was ""yeah right don't buy the hype."" Now I know that no amount of hype can do justice to this beer."
"I tried a few ounces in a tulip, and the rest out of the can. I have to say I enjoyed the tulip better as I consumed it as the bouquet was opening. In the end, it was simply a delicious beer."
Consumed in both the Can and out of a glass. Can is a bit better.
Very good.
Best double IPA
"Everytime, I drink this beer. It's like my first time. "
poured a orange/yellowish color with a bubbly white head. smells like like grapefruit and earthy pine. taste was almost so grapefruity it was tart and sour. amazingly smooth and each sip grew with more hops. Texture was kind of thick. Def overrated in my eyes for a double ipa but I would say this is top 15 dipas in my book
I dont understand why I am not giving this a 5. Its one of my all time favorite beers.
Love the hoppy goodness
WOW Fantastic.
"Case purchased 8/8/14 at Hunger Mountain Co-Op. Gave away half, drank half. Not much variation between cans, which is what they strive for."
"Got to try a sample of this beer. Pretty damn good IPA. It reminds me of a really good, unfiltered homebrewed IPA that is bombed with hops."
"By far, the nicest look and feel of a bottled/canned IIPA. Big fluffy white head and oodles of glass sticking lace. Low-medium carbonation give it a very soft and creamy feel, particularly when pared with the medium+ body. Aroma and flavor are as good as you could want for the style. Lots of pine and a long lasting bitter finish. Residual sugars lean it a click toward the sweet side and there's a touch of alcohol in the finish. Big thanks to Chuk for securing this one for me."
"Straw colored DIPA, with great head. The beer is incredible, so aromatic and floral. The hop profile is incredible but the beer is also very well balanced."
I thank my best friend for introducing me to craft beer and...heady topper. I now hate my best friend as I am now addicted and have to drive to Vermont and wait in line to buy heady topper!!
"Heady is so aromatic. Lots of citrus including Juicy grapefruit, tangerine and dank hops. Very slight hints of hay as it warms."
"First and foremost, gotta give a BIG thanks to DCLAguy11 for hooking me up with this brew I've been wanting to quaff for over a year. Seriously, thank you. I was really excited to try this. Re-he-he-heally excited."
"Overall: Fukin' Heady... ""That's all I have to say about that"", for now, haha... So good"
Just had my first of the mythical heady topper this evening!
"Finally got to have one of these last night! To me, this beer is perfect."
"Look, I'm not going to add a whole lot to the conversation here, but I've got to write something - I'm tearing up as I type... I've had this 4 times now. 1st at a party in Somerville, and I was half in the bag already. 2nd time it was warm. 3rd time was a tip from a guy at the bar I work at 2 a.m. And I'm having one now. All have been memorable. It is a remarkable experience."
I've had a few of these and hands down it's the best beer out there with outstanding flavors!
"This is a beautiful IPA that holds back on the bitterness that can *sometimes* overpower the delicate flavors in hops. While I love bitter beers that push the IBUs like Stone's 'Ruination,' Heady Topper takes the opposite approach while still maintaining a well-balanced malt character. The waves of hops wash over your palate and after you swallow you're left with that biscuity aftertaste from the lighter malts. "
Had never heard of this before but my local place got it on tap and wow it was excellent with a bit heavy on the froth but still a great pour. Not in your face like many imperials but smooth with a ton of hops and flavor. Didn't realize it was 8% until it started to hit me as I finished it as I hadn't eaten yet.
The best IPA I've ever had. Huge difference between drinking it from the can vs. pouring it. Do what the can says and drink it from the can.
First beer I had in my trip to Vermont. From very recent notes.
"As instructed, drank from the can. "
Smooth IPA for 8%
"To be fair, my buddy and I drove up to VT to get our hands on this beer that is in high demand and only sold in VT."
"A: Golden, Hazy, Very Cloudy, Two-Finger White Head, Medium/High Carbonation, Decent Lacing."
It meets the hype
exceptional IPA
"For my tastes, this beer is the perfect IPA. "
"Long time awaiting this masterpiece -- was the fortunate recipient of this tremendous beer from a fellow patriot and beer guy from Vermont that hand carried it back to Germany from the Northeast Craft Beer Mecca! Poured into and enjoyed from a Spiegelau IPA glass – sorry, John, I just can’t drink this White Whale from the can. "
"worth the hype. hard to see it being toppered, but so hard to obtain"
"What now, Pliny? ALL HAIL NORTHERN VT!!!"
"Really enjoyed this but I do think it is slightly overrated. The initial burst of hop flavor is something I will always remember. But the thrill only seemed to last halfway through the can, or my palate just got used to it. Its an aggressive beer for sure and really well crafted."
Broke the can's rules to properly review. Pale cloudy orange juice. 1 finger soft head but a light film sticks. Good lacing. I don't know what's in here but smells fantastic. Beautiful bouquet of hops. Great balance of citrus and bitterness. Strong carbonation but smooth and yet great mouthfeel. Like a 5 gum commercial. Can't go wrong with this beer.
Reviewed from notes. Sixteen ounce can shared by Dan - thanks.
The Benchmark!
"As good as it gets. Tastes like you are drinking a double IPA flavored creamsicle. Super smooth feel, citrusy aroma. Love drinking it out of the can but will occasionally pour it into a glass to see that beautiful orangey, hazy color."
"Consumed directly out of the can as directed on the labeling. No canned on or best by date present. Purchased at Bueno Y Sano (Burlington, VT). "
Amazing beer just not the best Beer or IPA out there. 
I love this beer.
With such a quick turn around the beer is always fresh and delicious.
Can never go wrong
"I have been waiting a year to grab this beer. Even though I hate IPAs, I wanted to see if this beer is worth the hype. I wasn't disappointed, an IPA I actually didn't mind drinking, which is the ultimate sign of respect from anti-IPA drinker. I can see why you ""hop heads"" dream over it"
"Brilliantly subtle. Hop flavor is strong, but not overpowering at all. The finish is somehow simultaneously light yet dense. Very balanced and amazingly drinkable. A remarkable beverage."
Great Hop Profile / Subtle Aroma / three sips in and you realize why it's #1 / Can drink this for days!
Delicious. I love the smell of smarties.
"Amazing Aroma. Had from Can as well as Glass. And man o Man, THis shit is bANging. Very nice lush mouthfeel, smooth drinking, and just overall balanced and well madE."
"When you get the right batch, there is no beer better than Heady Topper. "
"Damn, finally my excessive beer drinking has paid off and I have been granted the opportunity to at last taste the topper. Served in a can as the label so duly instructs, I did pour a smidge into a snifter for the sole purpose of being able to rate the appearance. And so here it goes..."
Just was not as special as when I first tasted Pliny the Elder
"This beer is a stable and outstanding brew. There is nothing to negatively state about it. The only reason I give it a 4.5 is because there is something that I taste in Pliny, Fat heads Hop JuJu and Three Floyds Permanent Funeral that just amazes me. I believe its the fruity aroma matched with the spectrum of flavors that hit me from those beers over Heady. Can't go wrong with heady though, its outstanding."
Delicious
"Purchased 2 cases in barre,vt on 08/11/14 "
"What better way to break in my brand new snifter than with a can of Heady Topper, the #1 rated beer on Beer Advocate."
I had this the first time I thought it wasn't impressive. I had it the next time side by side with pliny and I was blown away.Great beer with such a smooth taste and finish. Tons of fruit on the tongue and the finish was silky smooth.For a DIPA this is very drinkable. Can't wait to get some more.
"The hype is real. Tried my first heady last weekend. There is not much I can say that has not already been said. So, I will say that you have not tried an IPA until you drink one of these bad boys. I was in heaven from the start with the amazing floral smell. The taste is perfect it's crazy. I thought all the hype would ruin it. But no way...Like I said in the beginning the hype is real."
"I don't get it. Maybe I'm daft but the reasons for the over-the-top love for this beer elude me. It's a very nice, refreshing, not terribly complex brew. Good quaffer on a hot summer day, with a light grapefruity bitterness and a clean finish. It's fine. It's nice. I'll drink it again for $4 a can, but I won't drive to Vermont to get it or pay a scalper $14 for it. If I don't see it again, no big deal, there are hundreds of equally good, similar brews out there. "
"Pours a cloudy, unfiltered burnt orange color with a white soapy head. Pillowy foam.The aroma, well it is quite hoppy with floral, pine and citrus notes. Hints of honey and citrus oil."
"Heady Topper is not overrated. My first taste tonight (technically 4th) of this fine, superfine IPA , and I was not disappointed. West Coast style, in my opinion, and a beautiful cloudy hoppy dirty brew. If you pour it in a glass. Which is NOT recommended, so says the can. Well, some like it in the can, and I tried it, then poured it into a pint glass. "
Poured into Dogfish IPA glass
One of the greatest of all times. Well worth the trip to Vermont to get it.
Poured out a bit but kept most in the can. Definitely not as ugly as I was expecting. It's just a bit hazy. Golden body and good looking white head. 
"Best DIPA in the world. Feel like the ABV % is much higher than stated, which is a bonus. "
"I am looking at all of these reviews from people all around the country,getting this beer shiped or allowed warm at any time, the taste seems to get compromised and you dont get to enjoy the full experience. If your in Vermont, waiting every Wednesday at 10 am outside of the store for the truck to arrive, hoping you'll get a 4 pack or 2, when it's as fresh as ever. "
"I thought maybe the hype was too much for this beer, but god damn! This is amazing! The appearance is a dark golden hue with a nice head that lasts and then trails down the glass. The smell is full of citrus and baked bread. The taste is crazy complex with different sensations of hops coming through all through out the taste. Love this one, maybe a new favorite."
I was lucky enough to try my first Heady thanks to a very generous fellow BA(mojosly!!)
"I was able to get a can of the Heady Topper through a new acquaintance out of J'Town, PA. I traded Two Bros Night Cat and Side Kick for it. The beer poured a hazy straw color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is mostly sweet malt....and I was hoping for more pine and citrus. The taste was a good balance between sweeter malt and bitter hops there is presence of some pine and a touch of apricot like citrus all bolstered by an oily resiny base. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer....but not the best IPA I've had (IMO). It's great...don't get me wrong...but the original Zombie Dust before is was massed produced was better."
"Hard-to-find, but when I did I drink it straight from the can. Overall a good IPA but not the best I've ever had. I busted two cans in my luggage flying back from Vermont. So please protect it better than I did. Hoppy yes, but not too hoppy. Good balance."
"Received as an extra in a trade with malfunxion. First time trying this - and as advised from The Alchemist, I drank it straight from the can. The artwork on the can draws you in to that first sip. Taste is a perfect blend of hops with very little bitterness; delicious. Well done, but best beer in the world? No way."
So I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it packs a deceiving kick. Though I do think this is a great beer for hop heads and I do enjoy massive doses of that piny spicy flower I am not sure I could give this a 100. Great yes but a 100 no. The best beer not to me.
"Appearance- Hazy darkish yellow coloration. Strong white foamy head, but dissipates quickly."
"Appearance - Even though you are supposed to drink from the can i poured a little bit out just to get a look at it. Pours a very light orange, with almost no head. "
Yup. The hype gets so intense that there is often a rogue wave of backlash to counter its momentum. It was in this mind frame of slightly lowered expectations that I had my first sip of this admittedly outstanding beverage.
"Had this in a can (well, a couple of cans) in Burlington, VT. Stores all around were completely sold out but there were a few pubs on Church Street that still had them in stock. "
This beer is all hype. Most of the people that love this beer don't live in VT. This is not even they best IPA or DIPA in VT.
"I drank from the can so it's hard to judge appearance, but the can looks super sexy. "
Brew: The Alchemist Heady Topper
"Solid, really, really solid. Great beer. Lots of citrus and piney hops bursting through the can. Extremely smooth and delicious going down. Smooth, really smooth."
"A: (Sure, Alchemist tells you to drink straight from the can, but how can you review appearance when you do that? I'm a f**king rebel. I drink it from my IPA glassware) If kept in proper temp, this should look translucent and dark orange to you. No suspension, no settlement (if you see protein settlement, you kept it for too long!)"
What can you really say now? The only thing that the nose isn't as floral as some other IPA'S and doubles I have had.
"Hmmm, what can I say? It's one of the best beers I have had the joy of drinking. Everything from the presentation of the can, the four pack little plastic holder thingy, to the fact that it's a pounder can, just makes it that much more special."
I have had this beer multiple times and I just can't get enough. 
"DRINK FROM THE CAN! All caps, all bold, and topped off with an exclamation point. How does one disregard such a declaration? Furthermore, how do you rate appearance on a beer you can't see? Well, I cheated and poured some out. Nice, rich orange body, not too much head. But since it's the can that's truly making the appearance, let's talk about the can. The can is awesome. The dude with the outburst of hops from his cranium: terrific. And I'm partial to the message on the back: ""Don't Be A D-Bag, Recycle This Can."" "
"Had to pour out a little from the can despite the warning just to see the color. Carmel/amber in color. The nose is so fresh, full of citrus fruits and piney hops! No surprise here, that's pretty much the taste on the palate also. Quite a hop punch to this DIPA, excellent balance and acidity, alcohol masked well. Unbelievably drinkable and just so damn fresh. It's like I'm chewing on a hop cone. They say it's the water that makes this special but whatever it is, keep doing it. I hope they begin to distribute because getting a can of this in NYC was hard. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop head. It's a tough call, but I think this might top the all mighty Pliney!"
"Perfection. The best. Anyone who likes beer must drink this before at least once. I am lucky enough to have family near Waterbury, Vermont. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this is certainly the best beer you will ever hope to try. I especially love that it is only in cans."
"Drank from the can as instructed, but I prefer it from a glass. The nose is fantastic and the tastes lines up with you smell. Hoppy, tropical and smooth."
"A - hazy yellow sunshine, moderate to heavy lacing, inch of froth"
A - Really nice can - catchy but not flashy. Beer itself is a rich tan color - looks scrumptious. Perfect head. 
16 oz can poured into...wait...not pouring it anywhere. 
Brought all the way to Montana from Vermont... extremely excited to try this.
My first BA review... here goes..
"Finally got my hands on a can after all this time. Poured into my SN Liettich Balloon glass despite the ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" text on the can. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head. This is exactly what a DIPA should look like. Smell is of citrus and mango. The smell out of the can is just amazing. Best part of this beer. Taste follows the nose. Just in-your-face juicy hops. Fruity, citrusy, a little pine. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, which makes for a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA. Mouthfeel is great. I always say with a juicy IPA you need a fuller mouthfeel and this is exactly what I mean. Overall, a great DIPA, one of the best. Would I go way out of my way to get it again? Probably not but it's something everyone needs to try at least once."
"Amazing beer, I have about two 4 packs left over from my trip to Burlington left over. I don't have enough time on this site to post a trade, but am willing to do so. The beer is as good as claimed and I have enjoyed them since returning home to Toledo, OH where these beers are not available."
"Perfect gold color (though you're not supposed to pour it out of the can), extremely aromatic, very strong, rich, robust flavor - even with the 6 hops, the taste is not overpoweringly bitter as some traditional IPAs, but is extremely smooth and refreshing."
"An amazing IPA. Quite bitter, but a really nice balance of hop profiles between resinous, citrusy, and fruity. Consumed out of the can and out of the glass, no substantial difference."
"Incredible, re-visiting this one and there is not much here to dislike. "
"definitely worth the hype, if you can get it. Only sold near the brewery in VT. The aromas flowing out of this beer are tremendous. You won't be disappointed. I have only tried a few of them, but will definitely be searching for more. Good alcohol level. Go find it and try it!"
A big thank you to markgugs for this one! Looks like this was canned 4-29-14
"Ok there really isn't much I can add the the rep of this beer but rather than just ticking for the sake of ticking, I'll leave a comment. "
"2nd time trying this one and even better than I remember. The balance is amazing. Was fortunate enough to try a couple PTE's last year as well, but Heady beats it no contest. Can't wait to get back East in the spring and hopefully track some more down!"
Drank in the can.
it doesn't take alot of words to describe this beer because it's near perfect.
A: The website made me categorize this even though it tells you to drink from the can. The can's art is kinda nice...
"A: A very light orange, almost yellow, and quite cloudy."
"Dear beer drinking community,"
Purchased during almost monthly trips to Vermont. Drink out of can and out of tulip and occasionally from tap.
Acquired via trade at DLD. Shared witha buddy.
Can from HopSynonymous.
This heady topper is about 3 weeks old which is about the peak in my opinion. The very fresh stuff is a little off to me. 
"It's hard to be number one, and only be sold in Vermont...thanks again to cwelsh55 for the beer trade. Stand up dude, who drove 7 hours each way from outside of Philly to track down this highly sought after beer. Looks great in a glass took sip from the can but didn't think it would do the beer justice after that first sip. "
Serving Type - Can
"Finally got to try the #1 beer so thought I would write a review! Appearance is great, unfiltered and good yello/gold color. Smell is amazing with great hops coming through. Taste is where I am disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's good but not as hoppy as I was expecting. Can't tell but missing something. And mouthful was just alright. Overall a good beer but feel like I've had better IPAs out there."
Huge thanks to Dr. DmanGTR for this brew!!!! 
"Ok, I have been waiting to taste this one for a long time now. One of customers, who has in in depth knowledge of all sorts of beers, brought one 4 pack in for me to try. He was heading up to Vermont, so he was going to buy some more."
"Appearance: cloudy, pale, golden straw color."
"Drinking straight from the can, as instructed."
"Love it so much. Wave after wave indeed, it doesn't stop being good and filling your mouth. "
A: it pours a straw color with an orangy tan head.
"I won't make this a complicated review. I will tell you that his beer lived up to the hype for me. We all have different palates so I'm not going to try and tell you what I smell and taste other than the fact that this beer, to my palate was ridiculously smooth, incredibly drinkable, and had a great finish. Continue your mission to find it. You won't be disappointed."
"Poured half into a tulip glass to compare can vs glass, beer is a light yellowish gold, quite cloudy and hazy with a good white head and lacing. Looks fantastic."
"This is a great huge balanced IPA. Does not have the drinkaablity of Pliny but if you are loking for a wham in your face IPA with some malt backbone this is the best. Huge citrus and pine flavors very overhemling. medium to medium high mouthfeel. Not a hot weather IPA, would go great and standup with very spicy foods. Love the can and artwork."
"I know I'm supposed to drink from the can, but I just can't bring myself to do it. Heady pours a hazy light copper with a fluffy head that lingers as beautiful lacing on the glass. Pine, citrus and fresh cut grass fill the aroma. Especially when fresh, this beer is the closest thing to sticking your nose into a handful of hops. Thick, resiny hops fill the flavor, but there is almost more sweetness than bitterness upfront. Delicious light malt rounds out the intense, fruity, citrusy hops. The resiny, piney character lingers on the tongue in the after taste, and begs me to take another sip. "
Thanks Dan (CaptCleveland) for including this as an extra. Only bosses do that. 
Drank from the can
"Must admit, lives up to the hype. Best canned beer I've had. Poured in a pint glass. Great lacing! Full bodied beer with an upfront intense hoppiness. Just the right balance of pine and citrus. Soft on the palate with a hint of caramel for finish. Liquid GOLD!"
Lives up to the hype. Had it in can as instructed. Also worth trying in an IPA glass if you have enough of them to experiment. High alcohol content without losing its smoothness is one of its many impressive traits. Listen to the advice to drink asap. I had one several months old and the decline was noticeable. Enjoy.
A- amazing honey color hazy with a tinge of orange very little head little glass lacing one of the prettiest beers ive ever looked at
"so I have to pour it into a glass to see its appearance... right? first drink is out of the can, as recommended, and very nice. first drink is also just after the Pliny, for comparison purposes... hazy and unfiltered, my brain is saying ""hefe!"" dark, hazy yellow, some head from a soft pour. fragrant. some lemon. as someone else said, ""rich, creamy citrus nose..."" perfect description. and I liked this description also: ""silkier and thicker unfiltered mouthfeel..."" this is very good; I can see why it is compared to Pliny. both are very legendary brews.... I cant say one is better, it always fits your mood at the time, right? a little sweet, a little biscuit, very very beautiful... i'm happy to have tried this. I wonder how it tastes fresh?"
"Can to snifter, although just out the can is great."
"appearance: poured a bit into a glass to get a look and drinking the rest from the can as advised. Cloudy medium gold. Nice enough white head, messy lacing that doesn't stick around long. Pretty enough though I guess looks aren't what this guy is all about."
"The hype is real and so is the beer. I was lucky enough to get my hands on two cases at two seperate times and the biggest concern was drinking it and not having any left, but I didnt want it to sit around! "
"I was lucky enough to visit the cannery before it was closed to the public and have been able to get a few cans of Heady from various friends since then. Every time I have one, it's a borderline religious experience."
"So this is my first review as I am new to BA. I have been drinking this beer for sometime. My profile picture is off my trunk leaving Waterbury VT, I found a place that didn't have a case limit (like most do) so my trip was very productive."
"I should have reviewed this beer by now, but these reviews are hard to write while you've been imbibing."
"Long-awaited taste of this beer was well-worth the wait. To put it simply: This is an awesome brew! It is much hoppier than I expected, but this was a pleasant surprise to be sure. It was a great overall experience right from the can. I highly recommend this one, along with virtually everyone else who has had the benefit of enjoying it."
The hype is well deserved! I love Heady Topper so much that I feel the need to drive 18 hours to get more.
"Heady Topper....one of my beer drinking milestones....i've wanted to try this beer for a while,and it finally came available in my area....Poured from the can inyo an IPA glass....Absolutely lives up to the hype"
Had to drink a quarter from the can... Poured the rest gently into a glass.
"It says drink from the can but I poured it anyway for appearence reasons. Very west coast style, up there with the best of IPA's I have had. Wonderfully juicy and very refreshing, if it weren't 8% I could easily drink a sixer of it. Only had once since I am living in PA but will search out again"
"I am not, I repeat NOT, a hop head. This was the beer that changed my opinion of IPA's. So I guess it's fair to say I wasn't a hop head. The aroma is what first got me. Like a bowl of freshly cut tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is down right dairy-like. Creamy and not too thin. There is a perfect balance of bitterness and malty undertones. I live 5 hours (10 round trip) from the nearest retailer and I regularly make the trip to obtain HT. If you get the chance, don't pass it up."
This has been on my wants list for almost 2 years. I am going to try to be as open minded. If you would have told me 5 years ago that the #1 beer in the world would be from a can I would have said you were crazy. Lets see.
Heady topper is an ipa perfected. The hop profile imparts a perfect flavor without being overly bitter. The alchemist does a phenomenal job crating a perfect ipa for us hop heads that love the flavor of hops but may not care for the bitterness all the time.
A friend brought this to me on a recent trip to Vermont.
"The one definitely lived up to the hype. Tried it on a ""can-share"" with some friends. Nose was incredible, despite my initial distaste for IPA's. This helped me cross over to the hop side because the taste was not overwhelmingly bitter, but rather pleasant with pine and citrus flavors. A beer I hope to have another opportunity to sip on soon!"
2 months old
Drank this in the recommended can so it's difficult to rate the appearance. I gave it a 4 knowing that it's unfiltered.
This beer is fantastic! Every time I have it I am amazed at how smooth it is for the it's ABV. The taste is extremely complex and refreshing. I can't help but feel like I'm pouring an IPA through a bouquet of fresh hops directly into my mouth. Hands down a beer to get your hands on if you happen to come by it.
The is an outstanding DIPA. I could drink this all day everyday. A perfect DIPA for the novice as well and the Beer Geek
"A - When I did pour this one into a glass, I was surprised at how good it looked. I'd heard it was scary to view in a glass. It is a fine looking brew...but not as deep golden as other DIPAs."
L: What a beautiful can!
Had this tonight on tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury and can at my B&B in Stowe (the owner gets free misprints and gives them to guests on arrival if they're beer geeks)
It's Heady . . . what else can I say ?
Got this beer from a friend in New Hampshire.
"I've had this a few times. This is the most bitter thing I have tasted, but surprisingly you quickly get accustomed to it, and actually enjoy it. "
4/2/14 – consumed 5/5/14. Thanks to Scalawags for this awesome beer.
Can to glass
"Based on the last few cans of Heady Topper that I've had I have to down grade the rating a bit. I wish there was a better way of distinguishing which year or version of Heady Topper this is because it's not the same as it once was. Having said that, I did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper."
X x x x x x
"I finally found a hookup that could get me these on a regular basis. Man, it was worth the effort. The Alchemist seriously nailed it. This beer is damn near the perfect IPA. For this big of an IPA the bitterness, or lack thereof is notable. The hops just keep coming. I read that there was some oatmeal added for mouthfeel. I get it. Perfect. Seriously, it's oneof the best IPA's I've ever had."
"Cant believe i havent reviewed this before. Half way through a can, nows the time..."
"Poured into an IPA glass. Directly contrary to what the can says, I know, but it would be a shame not to see this beer. Super hazy pale orange color, with tons of bubbles rising up through the liquid, and a super thick off-white head that blankets the glass in lace as it slowly fades."
"Big, fresh hop aromas right out of the can - tons of pine and some nice citrus. Flavor is quite bitter, yet beautifully balanced, managing to be easy drinking while still full-bodied and packing a huge hoppy punch. Great mouthfeel, nicely complex, very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyable."
Drank it straight out of the can!
"Not 100% sure of the age, but my trader (TPSReport...big thanks) says it is about 3-4 weeks old. "
The pine hoppy smell and taste just makes you want more after every sip. Just make sure you're home or have a dd as this also gives a happy glow buzz. 
"Had to revisit this beer as all my previous examples were gifted to me, and never completely fresh. So, took a trip to VT, and grabbed myself a fresh case. So I'm re-reviewing. "
Purchased 2.22.14 from the Montpelier Discount Beverage and Redemption Center.
Poured from a can into a pub glass.
"I had one of these in Burlington, Vermont at a bar straight from the can."
"Although residing in the west coast, I've had the pleasure of trying this beer multiple times due to awesome friends. The first time I had this beer it was split three-ways, poured into glasses. At that time i felt that this beer was overhyped and couldn't stand up to the likes of PtE. However upon having a can to myself, straight from the can, I can definitely see why HT is so highly regarded."
"Did it live up to the hype? No, nothing ever does. Was it good? Hell yeah! I actually enjoyed my second one more as I knew what to expect. This was was more of a hop juice than something like a west coast IPA. I personally liked this with a couple of months on it more than fresh."
"Lucky enough to find a local shop that gets it shipped by a Vermont local. This beer is amazing a few weeks old, I can only imagine how good it tastes fresh! Even though it says to enjoy out of the can I prefer it poured into a glass. Helps me capture the amazing aroma."
"Poured into a glass yesterday at the Farmhouse Taphouse in Burlington yesterday. $8.00 to taste what is now a cult followed beer. I enjoyed enough to skip over to 240 Pearl Street and buy a case of 24 for roughly $88 USD. In case anybody wants to load up, delivery for Heady Topper is on Tuesday, so make sure you go when a delivery is imminent or shortly thereafter. Sitting around today and on my third can right now, and each one sheds more light on why this beer is so popular. It tastes light...fresh...and just bottom line - a real nice IPA."
"What can I say about this beer, it is everything people say it is and the hype is spot on. Although, the level if IBU's have been consistent at times I can have one where the hoppiness really comes through while other times it is more gradual and the notes are released with perfection. I know that the brewery has other brews that it releases in limited quantities, but I hope they can try and produce the other options with a bit more releases then they currently offer. But no complaints they are staying true to their brew and ""Heady Topper"" is always on my list of brews that I would have on any given day."
"This is an extremely, well-crafted beer. It is wonderfully balanced and well-hopped. Truly made by an Alchemist, or the devil himself."
"I drank Heady Topper a couple times from cans only, never on tap. I thought it was a great beer but not the best in the world. If I went out to a pub and they had HT , I would order and drink it over probably others because it's so hard to get anywhere outside Vermont."
I have to say this is a really good beer. I also have to say it doesn't live up to the hype of being the best beer ever. With all these hyped beers I have noticed a trend:
"Although I've had this beer a few times, I figured it warranted a proper review. I can't do one of those, so I'll just write some words. Unfortunately, I think this can is 6 or 7 weeks old now. So not the best version of itself. "
"Drank this right from the can as I was instructed. The nose smells like beer candy and the beer is creamy and hoppily delicious. This beer just does everything right, and honestly gets better with every sip. While it's not my favorite IPA I've ever had (Double Citra from Hill Farmstead currently wears that crown), this is absolutely wonderful and I would drink this every night if I could."
A - pours a cloudy burnt orange with a finger of off white foamy head. Foamy spotty clings to the glass after each sip. 
What's not to love about this beer? There are no compromises and makes no apologies. 
"Appearance: amber or even an off gold colored, not really cloudy, just opaque enough not to be able to see through. "
"Heady Topper. Yes, the 'holy grail.'"
Enjoyed from a 16 oz can as instructed.
First off a big thank you to my friend Jim for this beer! I live in San Diego so this is really hard to find.
"Simply the best beer made. This beer astounds the senses. The aroma teases one with the layers of flavors to follow. Those flavors swarm the tongue with complexity-floral, tropical, juicy hops carried upon a perfectly balanced malt kiss of love."
"I went into my first Heady Topper with great expectations. My friend, whose beer opinion I've trusted since the 7th grade, really talked great things about this beer. It really intrigued me about how good he said it was. So I decided to get my Google on and do some research. Every rating site I found gave it tremendous reviews. Thousands of reviews and all of them were extremely high ratings. I found myself determined to track this brew down!"
"I love this freakin beer. Unlike some of the heavier/boozier top beers, this not only goes hand in hand with Pliny for best in class, but is a daily drinking beer too. Just wish it was more readily available so I could have it daily. If you ain't had it, get you some."
"Am very lucky to have a steady supply due to my proximity to Waterbury. Due to that I am always looking forward to cracking the next heady that brings that delicious hoppy not to citrusy ipa smell to your nostrils. The taste is the most memorable i've ever had with the perfect bite to accompany it's 8% abv, making it impossible to not savor the last taste. Believe the hype."
A. Not sure I followed directions and drank it strait
Poured a tiny bit into a glass just to get a look at it. Its unfiltered so it is meant to be cloudy and not too clean.
"A fantastic Double IPA. It does however have a very sweet after taste. The reason this beer is rated so well is the genius marketing from the Alchemist Team. Cheers to you for that John! I am drinking this beer out of a glass right now, and I do have to say that they are deadly serious about it being better in the Can."
"Taste and mouthfeel were spectacular. Hits your nose like a hammer straight to your olfactory senses. Do NOT pour this beer into a glass as it is to be enjoyed fresh from the can, doing so will result in little white specs in your beer leaving it to seem much less appealing."
Poured into a tulip glass. Thanks to Elkevo for this!
The best what else can u say but it is the BEST!!!
Poured from 500ml can into a stemmed tulip glass (beer was 6 days old)
"S: My god, crack a can and you can smell it across the room. Immediate grapefruit, then pine, I can't detect the alcohol"
Citrus hits you hard when you crack open a can. The juicy hop flavors are layered in an interesting way so as to get something a bit different with every sip.
Typical Double IPA. Had a great crisp citrus taste to it. It was not as smooth as I thought it was going to be. Notice the hops more on the after tastes. cloudy appearance. In my opinion not worth all the hype. I can easily say there are so many better IPA's out on the market.
"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Best beer in the Country. Often imitated, never fkn duplicated. I've had all the ""best"" x times and none of them are the Topper. This beer leaves you feeling like you just ate a fresh grapefruit. It leaves you wanting to crack another. I've had it out the can and out of a Tulip, and its just as good either way! GOD BLESS THE ALCHEMIST! You want the beer You're drinking now to be like this but just admit it... It's not!"
"A: Pours a cloudy orange/yellow color with a half finger white head that dissipates to a light film, light lacing. "
"been a member for a while now and visit the site frequently but have never written a review so i figured why not start here, after finally getting my hands on this gem. "
"A long time coming for this review. Two of my great friends brought back 2 cases. I went into this the same way it sounds like a lot of people do. very excited BUT somewhat skeptical. How can everyone agree that this is one of the best beers no matter what your personal preference in style is? Well...just because it is. Luckily my favorite beers are imperial IPA's. The can says Heady Topper, but I almost instantly nick named it 'rolling thunder' for two reasons. 1. Its got a high ABV in a 16 oz serving. 2. because its rolling waves of super deep hop, after hop, after hop. Each wave releases a different flavor that ignites your mouth with an assertive force and refuses to leave after you're done drinking it. It takes about 5-10 minutes for it linger away. My favorite part of this wonder is the very middle. There becomes a blast of grapefruit dryness in the middle that is incredibly apparent. You might say its sweet because its a very bright flavor but its not sweet in any sugary artificial way. I think the moment when the middle grapefruit blast hits is the best because of the waves of pine and floral hops that come on the front, and back ends before you reach that middle peak explosion. It has an awesome body that you can really feel on your palate, and has an aromatic smell that you can not ignore."
"I was expecting a party in my mouth when I had this beer. All I ended up with was just some good beer, no GREAT beer. I think the hype of this beer hurt the chances. I prefer a nice florally west coast IPA over this one note beer."
"Ok so the beer is perfect. I have been drinking it for a while and it never disappoints nor does it become old. the flavors are always fresh tasting and always exciting. the first time I drank it it I poured it into a glass because I thought the ""Drink out of the can"" was hype. Incredible as the taste out of the glass was, it was otherworldly out of the can. The initial whiff of the hops when you pop it open is Ecstasy. The promise of a great beer to come delivers on your first sip and then the magic happens as each sip brings out different flavors from bitter to sweet back to bitter all in different stages. "
"I do not like to ""believe the hype"" but Heady Topper did not disappoint. Did not drink out of the can. The color when poured in a glass is beautiful. The smell is very unique and the flavor holds true. One of my most important factors in tasting beers is the after taste. Heady just keeps going and going. Fantastic beer."
"Received a 4-pack in a trade. Served chilled in the can, as per the manufactures instructions. "
The smoothest and easiest to drink 8%+ abv beer I've ever had. A magical experience - the pungent bitter hop flavor lingered long after finishing. There's a nice subtle grapefruit presence on the back end as well. Lucky me I have 12 more of these!
Yellow/orange body with a fluffy white head.
"I've been lucky enough to have this a few times and it's consistently one of the best IIPA's I've had. It's not some revelatory flavor that doesn't exist in any other beers, it's the combination of those flavors and how everything is perfectly balanced. It's the Goldilocks soup of beers, just right. "
A: pours an orangeish hazy color with a finger high head that leaves great lacing
"First of all, and I certainly won't be the first to say this, but I HATE drinking beer in cans. You do not see, you cannot smell correctly and it looks cheap! Anyway, I did obey what the can says and I did drink it out of the can. "
I don't know how beer can taste any better than this. I thought there was no way this could live up to the hype. Wrong.
"A- although I drank this gorgeous elixir from the can, I watched as it was carefully poured into a tulip. Perfect orange-salmon haze with a prominent head and steady lacing."
"A - pours beautiful hazy orange (I've poured it out and drank from that can, as advised). Amazing two finger head with slight lacing around the glass. A real work of art."
One of the best Double IPAs I've ever tasted. 
"I'd forgotten about the ranty feeling-sorry-for-myself review from last August (Reposted below.) But I am here to report I finally hit Heady paydirt. That is, my friend BigStein88 gave me two precious cans. "
What is there to say about this beer that hasn't already said a million times?
"When you go against the advice on the can, it pours a hazy orange and has a bright white creamy head."
"Thanks has to go to nedvalton, a most generous BA'er for hooking me up with my first Heady Topper. As soon as I popped the top on that shiny silver and black can I got blasted with the dankest, hoppiest, fruitiest, hop bombiest goodness I have ever experienced. There's just so much going on with the smell, that I am having a hard time nailing it down. Here goes nothing, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, Bubblegum surf wax, I swear I'm getting that. This stuff smells exactly like I imagined it would after reading so many of the reviews on here, an absolute delight. I poured about half into a tulip glass so that I could get a good look at it. Pours a super hazy and resinous golden orange hue, minimal head and lacing. It smelled amazing in the can, but the complex aroma really opened up once poured, now I'm even more intrigued. My first sip and all I can say is, YES! Worth all the hype, 100 percent! I've had a few other beers that come real close to this, but the mouthfeel and balance along with the juicy aftertaste make this an absolute work of art in a can! With each sip it gets better and better, the bitterness isn't overwhelming at all, and couple that with the citrusy/fruity/floral undertones that coat your tongue, it's easy to forget that theres alcohol in there. Just like it says on the can ""so drinkable, it's scary"" Overall I can see why this beer is ranked #1, because it just became my #1 as well. Thank you nedvalton, and thank you Alchemist!"
"Good head but quick dissipation, mild lacing. Cloudy and golden in appearance. Nose is mild-moderate in strength, fruity with no hint of dank-type hop aromas. Taste is very smooth, silky mouthfeel, with moderate-strong but not overwhelming hop profile. It's all peach and grapefruit with no dank character at all, more intense and complex as the beer warms. Only a mild suggestion of the heat in the finish. This is a great beer but perhaps not as world-class a beer as Pliny, in my humble opinion."
"My can was said to be super fresh… poured into a New Belgium goblet the hazy and yeast debris was quite heavy. Otherwise, tawny-amber in hue with a sticky white head and plenty of subsequent lacing. "
"Heady Topper is by far one of my favorite beers ever sampled. I've had it probably over 20 times, very hard to get, but they always happen to show up at our beer tastings. I'm not a huge fan of the amount of yeast/sediment in the bottom, but if you pour it just right into a pint glass you can avoid most of the sludge. Very hoppy and very flavorful."
Had drank from can except for a little bit to get appearance 
"This is easily the best DIPA or IPA that has ever come across my palette. Not being a fan of particularly hoppy beer, I was hesitant that this would be too much for me. I'm pleased that I gave it the chance it deserved. I've now opened up to these complex and floral offerings. Heady Topper is the gold standard. The pure evergreen-ness of this beer perfectly conveys the woods where it is brewed. Well done Alchemist."
16oz can. Drank it straight from the can. I did pour just a tiny bit in a small glass to get the appearance.
"My first post on BA. While a seasoned IPA drinker, this beer is simply the best. I have recently had FRESH GROWLERS OF firestone union jack, sierra nevvada torpedo, nugget necctar, Hop Stupid, Hop Nosh, etc... it had been 2 months since my last heady topper. Very Lucky to have a friend pick me up 12 of these unreal IPA's . while I like hoppy beers I like balanced IPA's not overly bitter. . This beer is perfect. Drinkability is unreal for an 8% IPA. Flavor is fruity but not overly so, hoppy, but not overly so, simply the best. No contest."
Pours a beautiful hazy and golden light orange. The nose jumps out of the can as soon as you crack it open. A bouquet of hops tickle your nose hairs. Wave after wave of hops delicately balanced with malts overtake your palate. Drinks really easily for 8% and has a fantastic finish.
"Easily the best beer I have had the good fortune to taste, so it is appropriate that it be my first review on BA. Living in NH, my close proximity has allowed me to enjoy it fairly regularly. A wonderful smelling beer that when fresh can literally fill a room with a floral citrus hop aroma. It pours with a nice head, and has a typical cloudy appearance in the glass for the style. The alcohol is well masked. This beer has a nice balance of heavy citrus hops and bitterness. My only wish is that the alchohol content were a little less so I could enjoy more than one in an evening. However, it is the kind of beer you can drink slowly and savor each sip. If you have not had it, make a trade to get it, as it deserves the #1 rating it currently holds."
If you are a person who likes hops this is a beer for you. This beer is a nicely brewed DIPA which explodes your palate. a well balanced floral/fruit aroma and hoppiness flavor and a citrus bite to it. overall this was a great beer. if you can get your hands on this beer you'll be in heaven.
"Outstanding. This beer was a about a month and a half old, but was still extremely hoppy and fragrant. I can only imagine how much better it would have been if it were fresher. Nevertheless, this was a great beer. Kudos Alchemist Brewery, ku-fucking-dos."
"Heady topper has all that a hop lover would appreciate and more. The unfiltered, strong flavor of the hops overpowers the flavor of the alcohol. This beer recommends that you drink it from the can to allow unfiltered parts at the bottom to remain. The most flavorful and delicious beer of this type that I have had."
"Top beer. Although it says drink from the can, I enjoy it from a glass much better. Full grapefruit smell. High hop taste. Mouthfeel is OK. Little to no bitter aftertaste. Ages ok, but best fresh. Got mine from the brewery before they closed the retail shop."
"A- Cloudy, golden, 1/2 inch collar of foam"
I'm honestly not sure what all the hype is about. I think the fact that it's hard to get and really hoppy makes it a winner in most people's books. For me though it had a weird background taste every sip that I wasn't really used to I guess. After about the 3rd or 4th can though I started to like the beer a lot more.
Drank from the can.
Serving: Out of the can as instructed by Alchemist Brewery
Served cold from a 16 oz can into a 7 oz taster. This is contrary to instruction from the brewer to drink straight from the can.
Is there really a perfect beer? Absolutely!! This was well worth the wait. I got my hands on 2 4-packs and opened one as soon as I got home. 
"Finally had a chance to get my hands on a can of HT. Poured into a glass, even though it says to drink from the can. The aroma of this beer is fantastic. Very floral and pleasant. First sip was no different. It's a very unique Imperial IPA. Not over bearing with the hops but you know they're there. Very smooth and easy to drink, which is dangerous for an Imperial IPA. I wish this stuff wasn't so hard to get because I'd have a fridge full of it right now. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Thanks to the DreamWeaver. Word on the street is this can is approximately 3 weeks old. Not ideal, but I'm not complaining (too much.)"
"As close to a perfect beer as you can get. It lives up to the hype. You can drink it ice cold, even warm and it will still tastes great. The first thing I noticed was the excellent aroma. This is a really hoppy beer but not bitter at all. My favorite beer to date."
Took ski trip this weekend to burlington area with a stop at the hunger mountain coop to grab a few cases to take back to new york. Hunger Mountain Coop is the place to go for Cases but generally sells out in a few hours so you have to time it right. 
"I have only had this beer a handful of times.... ok, I lied, I've had it twice... This is a beer a plan my day around to drink because it is just that good and that rare I get to drink it, regardless of how hard I try to get it."
"I had this at Revolution Kitchen, a primarily vegan restaurant in Burlington. I'd heard all the hype about Heady and was, to say the least, cynical. Well, put me down as a believer."
"Wow, what a beer."
"The legends are true. This is an especially tasty, and dense IPA. "
"Look - well, I drink this beer out of the can per the instructions - can is nice to look at, but going to give this the same as the overall score. Smell - Citrus (orange and grapefruit) - clean small. Taste seems to alternate between orange and grapefruit on the front. Malty finish as described."
Murkiest beer I've ever poured. I can see why they want you to drink from the can.
"16oz. can! This one pours a cloudy darker golden color. There a few floaties in there. Small white head that doesn’t linger long but does leave some lacing. Big nose of hops, hops and more hops! Grapefruit is the main contributor. Maybe some pineapple, peach and orange in there too. Nothing else making past the hops. The taste is good. Not nearly as bitter as you think it might be. Nice rounded flavor, fairly bitter, but there is a touch of sweetness hiding in there. Grapefruit and pine hops, with a strong malt body behind it. I’d say it definitely lives up to the hype. Now to get some more..."
"Was finally able to track down through a trade, can't wait to try it! Had first quarter in can to experience it and then poured into tulip to compare."
"Well here it is. Heady Topper. Poured into a tulip glass (we are trying to culture the yeast, so no drinking out of the can.)"
the best DIPA i have ever tasted. poured a little into a snifter glass to view appearance: very hazy almost imposable to see through. smells very dank. the mouthful is very heavy and filling. finish is perfect! if you can get your hands on this beer it is a must have!
"Finally had the chance to try one while skiing at Sugarbush and I must say, it is worth the hype. That first sip speaks for itself. Hints of citrus with a smooth body that is not too overwhelmingly hoppy. The beer is surprisingly refreshing while retaining a nice hoppy taste and a strong full flavour. The perfect beer to have after skiing and I was very content having only one. The next day i had another one and the quality was equally impressive. A great beer to drink slowly and enjoy as each sip reveals a unique taste. Easily the best double IPA i have tried and one of the only beers where i can honestly say that less is more. Saviour it while you drink it and you will totally be impressed!"
Poured from the can into a Alchemist Heady Stemless glass. Saved the last few ounces in the can and wow it does taste great out of the can. Get a lot more citrus from it.
Gift from a fellow BA in NC
Canned: Don't see a date
So I got to try the number 1 rated beer on beeradvocate.com
This is a treat. 
"I visited the brewery several months ago. I was impressed with the area. I think I could live there for a little while. The can says to drink it out of the can; so you can get the full deal. I agree, I did smell the beer better while it was in the can. Everyone claims to get a ton of peach flavor, but I really didn't. I got more pineapple/citrus. But Still a great brew. "
"Received a can from a neighbor that hales from Vermont. As instructed by the can, I did NOT pour but drank directly from the can."
Served in the can for the smell and taste then poured rest in glass for appearance.
"A - beautiful bright light orange, cloudy, nice two finger white head and lacing all over on the drink down."
"Finally made it to the Holy Grail. Gratefully, the experience took place in a true Mecca location...Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont -- appropriately, the very site of The Alchemist's original brewery (prior to Hurricane Irene). In any event, as my good friend Khalil Saliba and I saddled up to the bar here (on Tuesday night, 1/28/14) and nervously ordered the first Heady Topper of our lives, the excitement was noticeably palpable. Hell, I almost shit my pants when the lovely bartendress set the beautiful tulip glass down in front of me. Awesome 2-finger head, which dissipated very slowly. Beautiful, cloudy orange/amber color, with expected cloudiness. Tremendous sticky lacing throughout. The nose was an incredible citrus pine of grapefruit, with hints of orange/mango/tangerine, all of which was replicated on the palate. But perhaps the most remarkable aspect, and (I believe) the signature of the HT experience, was the stupendous balance between the citrusy hops and the chewy malts throughout, with no heat of alcohol evident whatsoever which, along with the lovely, full mouthfeel, makes this beer outrageously easy to drink."
Can from Winooski.
American double/Imperial IPA
"This is the best DIPA I have ever had. Piney, grapefruit, citrus, sweet. All these flavors in perfect harmony. Some how there is a hop bitterness but also refreshing. There is just so much balance in this can. Nothing is overwhelming or outshining the overall balance of the beer."
"I have been wanting to try this for quite a while now. So many people I know are always telling me this is the best. Well, I have to agree with them. As soon as I cracked the tab on the can the beautiful aroma overwhelmed me and the taste of this beer is so delicious and it is so smooth and citrusy....wow !!!! Definitely worth the wait and highly recommended for any IPA lover !!!!"
Enjoyed 1/2 out of can and 1/2 out of ipa glass! 
"Drinking straight from the can. Have poured it into a glass before, but definitely prefer the can. As soon as I crack it open you smell all the hops. Pine. Citrus. Big grapefruit aroma.I miss going to the brewery and smelling all the hops. Smells so fresh. A ton of hops on the flavor. All the stuff in the aroma comes through and coats the tongue with a wave of pine and citrus. So resonious. Nice carbonation, as well. Mouthfeel is where this beer shines. Such a great beer and absolutely worth seeking out."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here. Heady is what everyone makes it out to be, the best DIPA around."
"Poured about 3oz into a snifter for appearance and smell, taste, feel, and overall are from the can"
trade extra from SloppyJoeWasAMan
"from the can, this beer is just incredible, what can be said that hasnt already been said. If you love hops jump right in and take a bath. great complexity pineapple up front, citrus galore, piney and juicy all they way through. every sip makes you think of something different, there is so much going on with this beer its impossible to capture in words or in one sip, so grab a few cases."
"Consumed right from the can, because The Alchemist told me to, and I'm not about to second guess that magnificent man."
Drank straight from the can. 
From notes 11.28.13:
Received in a trade from Liquidswordz. Thanks!
"I can't say enough about this beer, I've been drinking it consistently for over a year now, I'm from Vermont so I grab a case every Monday. I never felt the need to review it until now. As I said, I drink Heady Topper quite a bit, but this last weekend, I had the pleasure to taste it against Lawson's Double Sunshine, Dogfish 75 Min IPA, Pliny the Elder, and Hill Farmstead's Abner, and for the first time since I've been drinking Heady Topper, it had competition. I love Harpoon IPA and drink it regularly, but after a Heady Topper it's tastes like Bud Light. "
16 oz. aluminum can with two pours into a snifter glass
"Tangerine, pineapple, light mango, some resin, light bread, medium bitterness, clean sweet malt"
"I was concerned that this would under deliver. Gladly it truly lives up to the hype. Beautiful pour. I split this pour into a sampling glass from the Garden State BrewFest and straight from the can, as suggested. Loved it all the way through. This improved with every sip. The last sip was the best as all the goodness remaining at the bottom of the can and mixes with each tip of the can."
"A- Breaking their #1 rule, I sometimes pour this into a glass. (Alchemist prints ""Drink from the Can"" on the outside of every can) Its too good not to experience the site of it in a glass! "
"I've been lucky enough to grab a can of Heady Topper through a friend who did a trade for it, otherwise I wouldn't have had the sheer pleasure of tasting this beauty. Living near the ""Hop Highway"", I'm used to good IPAs near me. Put this one up there with Pliny and Enjoy By, which are the best IPAs that I can easily get."
"I've tasted a fair amount of beer to this point in my life. This beer is by far the best beer I've had the privilege to enjoy. It has a very hoppy aroma, so strong in fact you can smell it in your car with the windows rolled up as you're arriving to the brewery in Waterbury, VT. It has a fantastic hoppy flavor as well."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Trader told me this is about 6 weeks old so not the freshest but I'm not as worried about canned IPAs as far as age goes, as long as it's not super crazy old. "
Served from can (duh) into a belgian glass.
"I was luck enough to land six in a trade recently and enjoyed 3 of them. One in the can, one in a glass, and one where I poured a few ounces into a glass at a time. Overall, best IPA/IIPA I've ever had. I'm still having olfactory hallucinations about the massive tropical fruit, mainly pineapple, aromas this beer displays. I will be trading for moe of this soon. Well worth the effort and lives up to all the hype."
"A- Orange in color, with a good clingy IPA head. "
originally 4.25 on 1/11/14
"Searching for the holy grail of beer, brought me to Vermont. Found 12 cans at hunger mountain coop, will taste from the can as well. Continued the pilgrimage to the prohibition pig. Ordered heady toppers for me and son #2 whilst waiting for a table."
"First off..gotta thank Rich at South Bay Beverage in Massapequa,NY..he gave me Heady for FREE..he knew i was looking for it and had some he was drinking for himself,not for sale..so props to Rich.."
Been waiting to try this beer for a looong time. It was worth the wait. 
"Been looking forward to this for a long time. Drove up to Vermont to get me a case. Yes it was worth the trip. Had one on Tap when in Waterbury. I had my first one from the case out of the can as directed the next day I had one from a tulip glass. was impressed with the smell or nose both ways. The appearance is the weak link here. Not ugly but a little hazy you might say. Dose not effect my felling towards the beer at all though but I scored it a 4,25 to be true. "
"A kind of ugly beer - I see why they suggest drinking it from the can. Pours a hazy orange with a little sediment and not much in the way of head action. The aroma is fruity - tropical, with some apricot and mango. The flavor follows suit, with mango, apricot, pineapple, and a blast of big sticky hops. The mouthfeel is big and round. This beer is at once unusual and familiar - it reminds me of the beer to which it is so often compared, Pliny the Elder, though it is bigger and fuller, both in its tropical fruit and rounder mouthfeel. It's clearly less dry than the Russian River beer. But curiously the West Coast beer to which it most closely compares, in my view, is Racer 5 from Bear Republic - they are different beers, but both are round, fruity and given to showing up with a thick orange haze. It is as if Racer 5 and Pliny crashed into one another and spawned some crazy new hybrid. Heady Topper is a very good beer, but I wonder whether the frenzy would be as great if it were produced in greater quantity and distributed more widely."
A: Poured a hazy yellowish orange with a white head.
Believe the hype!
Poured from the can (oops) into a dimpled mug. Pours a cloudy orange-straw colour with a foamy white head.
"Crack open the can and smell the hops then take a sip, heaven. "
Drank a few of these from the can as instructed to by the labeling. I just couldn't resist pouring it into a pint glass for the next round.
"Served in a becker pint glass. Second dance with this highly regarded beer, reviewed from notes."
"This offering from The Alchemist is fantastic, the nose is super herbal and spicy aromatic from the hops. Sweet syrupy mouthfeel with a soft piney hop bite in the finish. Very balanced as stated on the can making this very enjoyable. One of the better IIPA's on the market."
"Appearance- Only poured about an ounce as this one is supposed to be enjoyed from the can. Pours a hazy golden orange, decent sized white head for the pour and moderate lacing. Quite hazy but the can states that it is the intention."
BELIEVE THE HYPE!
"As a VTer, I have been fortunate to purchase this on a regular basis directly from the brewery."
Purchased and consumed many times over the past couple of years. I typically ignore the can and drink from a tall glass. 
"Got my hands on a case while visiting VT, absolutely fantastic beer that lived up to the hype. "
"Pours out a nice orange in color in color with a small white head that dissipated quick. Smell is really fruity with orange, mango, and pineapple with a little a tiny bit of malt but it is so in the background that the hops are the forefront. Taste is really fruity with all that was in the nose but there is a tiny bit more bitter hops in the background that sits in the mouth and really meld well with all he other stuff going on. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick for the style and really adds a lot to the beer. Overall this is an amazing beer that is hopped so well that it's a very hard beer to beat for the style. It is world class!!!"
"FINALLY!! Had the elusive Heady Topper!! Now at first, I wanted to come at this beer with an open mind. After all the hype and the talk about this beer, I cracked my first can. BAM! The aroma hits my nose. The floral, citrusy hoppyness enters my face holes. I take the first sip...let the beer move around my mouth. THIS BEER LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!!! Absolutely delicious from beginning to end. After my first few sips I sat there and just smelled it over and over to let that beautiful hoppyness permeate. great finish to the beer, tons of hops and floral tastes along with a sort of citrus/fruitiness. The hardest thing about this beer is keeping it in my fridge. Don't let anyone know you have this beer if you really want to savor it, because people will ask to drink one. And I'm not willing to share right now."
"I decided to turn a recent ski vacation on a BeerSKI vacation. Took a trip to Montpellier for a crazily hectic search for this magical nectar. The process of finding HT, and trying to beat out other people in the parking lot to the next case made the first cracking of the can that much more rewarding. After all, this beer is incredible"
"My son brought us a bottle of fresh Pliney the Elder for Christmas. I've heard so much about the beer and it certainly lived up to the hype. Talk about fresh-it was bottled 10 days earlier! Immediate grassy, fresh hop aroma followed by the most fresh IPA hop flavor! The flavor seemed to intensify as it warmed up a bit. Clean, refreshing finish. Simply amazing."
"First had Heady (straight from the can) back in April 2012, standing in a good friend’s kitchen in Burlington. He hands it to me, “Here, this is good canned beer.” A couple of swallows later, I interrupted the old-friends-catching-up conversational tsunami, “Wait. What is this?!? 'Good canned beer'? This is the best canned beer I’ve ever had!” Heady is no longer revolutionary--in fact it now looks fairly tame poured into a glass--and I've had a lot of great ""east coast"" or ""New England"" IPAs since. But I haven't had one I would rather drink than Heady."
I have had many hoppy beers....but this one takes the cake. 
"A: hazy golden, i want to jump in"
Finally got to try. My can is under a week old. In my book this stuff absolutely lives up to the hype. A perfect hop forward IPA. I prefer it in the glass so I can admire the color and the smell. It appears a murky yellow / orange almost resembling juice. The smell is hops and more hops. Taste just like it smells - awesome! This is the real deal!!!
Drank from the can as instructed...
A - The beer is medium shaded yellow with a dense white head. 
The alchemist Deserves Credit For Focusing On Their Only Beer And making It perfect And Out Of A Can! It Is unfiltered But Color Is Consistent Surpringly Small Head For Something Named Heady Topper. It Is Very Smooth great Complexity Of flavor And You Could Drink A Lot And Forget It is 8% . A Cult Like Following And Hard To Find.
"Received in trade from Bricenice, Thanks Mike!"
Poured from a can into a tulip.
"Tried it at the brewery on tap, tried it from the can 1 day old, and tried it from the can 6 months old."
Enjoyed once before and once after an 8 mile mountain trail run.
"I just tried this beer for the first time, and I have to say I'm impressed. Against my better judgement, I followed the directions on the can and decided to drink it without pouring it into my tulip."
"Amazing beer, have had it many times as it is locally available. If it is more than 2 weeks old it quickly becomes an average IPA. "
Hands down the best beer I've ever had. I heard all the hype and went down to the brewery to try it myself. I left with 3 cases and a new favorite beer. 
"So many flavors. Drank out of a snifter poured fresh from the can. A variety of hops throughout although not too much (I am no ""hophead""). Delicious malt. Cannot recommend enough. Lives up to the hype if you can get your hands on a can. Glad I live in Vermont."
Can sent in a trade - 2 weeks old. 
"This is an absolutely incredible beer. I am a huge fan of Double IPAs, so I try them all and this is the best one I have had to date. It has such a refreshing taste and it packs a punch. I wish it wasn’t so hard to find, but I know that adds to the mystique. For all you beer fans out there, you will find it in Burlington along with many other good beers. I usually can argue top 250 ratings, but this one has the right top dog."
"What else can I say. Heady Topper has been one of the few beers out of all that I've tried that really lives up to the hype. A masterpiece by The Alchemist. Beer looks great and tastes great whether out of the can or poured. Appearance is copper, orange, unfiltered, cloudy, danky looking. Smell is spot on hoppy, piney, danky and citrusy. Taste is incredible with lots of pungent grapefruit in your face balanced by the piney bitterness and malt. Keeps you wishing you had a whole case. Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated. It goes down so easy. This beer is #1 for a reason."
Not being an ipa fan this beer is awesome. The hops are so well balanced. Highly revcommend dor the non ipa lover. I bought a 4 pk and can kick myself for not getting a case . Next visit I will get at least 1 case! A definite option for the non IPA oriented consumer.
"Received two 4-packs in a trade with bostonbeans originating on the other site. Purchased a week ago, so this beer is fresh to deff... Whatever that means. First time drinking, and I'm pretty excited. Thanks, Vini!"
Drinking this beauty on a lazy Saturday afternoon and figured I should have reviewed this a long time ago.
So the age old debate.... Heady vs Pliny...
"This is my 2nd time having this, and it shocked me both times."
"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a Spiegelau tulip - no, I didn't follow the rules and drink it out of the can. No freshness date printed on the can."
"Finally got my hands on some of this, first off let me say this beer is awesome. The second you open the can you are hit with an explosion of hops."
"I must say this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Not only does it taste flawless but it looks and smells flawless as well. One of the most difficult beers to purchase on the market! Well worth the wait though. The smell alone if like no other, very fruity and strong, but not over powering."
A - The beer is golden yellowish with a sticky white head. good lace in glass but its best served drank from can because it dosnt look that good.
They hype was not false. This was absolutely divine!
"Definitely worthy of a 100 rating. Fresh hop beer consumed very soon after shipment arrived. Dank, grassy hops. Slight spice and earthy tones. Perfect carbonation and a sweet, faint malt character. Still trumped by Pliny and Enjoy By but among the top of its class. Oh, and I was a bad boy and didn't drink from the can. Hats off to the Alchemest all the way from Vermont doing the west coast ipa as good as or better than almost anyone out there."
Can that traveled from Vermont to Washington to Maine.
"Another head sucked into the hype. After trying the sample from the Alchemist tap, which was damn delicious, I was still unsure if the journey was worth it. Settled back where I was staying, I cracked a can and fell in love."
"When it's fresh it's truly amazing. Liquid hop candy. Sweet but not cloying with with notes of resin, pine and grapefruit. Like drinking a liquid forest. As it ages it loses it's sweetness and grassy notes begin to dominate."
"From the first crack of the can the piney hops aromas are enough to make you think you are amongst the pine covered hills of Vermont. The can does not lie - your first sip will be an explosion of hops. This beer is not for the faint of heart, but if you are a hop head beware... this DIPA could quite possibly ruin all others for you. :)"
Poured from the can into a tulip glass...
Made the 7 hour round trip to acquire this wonderful beer. 
"Let me preface this by saying, I'm not much of an IPA hop head. But a buddy scored this and I had to try it out of the can followed by in a glass. I actually like the glass offering better, but here goes: Poured from can into DFH snifter. Great looking light pale yellow beer with an inviting 2 fingers of head. Straw hues and a bit of cloudiness. Smell is awesome. Citrus hops meet earthy/pine hops. Getting grapefruit and apricot on the nose. Taste was pretty balanced and smooth for such a strong announced IBU. For not a big fan of the style, I was glad it went down as easy as it did. More pronounced fruit as it warmed. The can offering just seemed a bit less flavorful? to me than the glass. Feel was great with a medium heft and carbonation that was pleasant. Overall: The best IPA I have had, but again it's not my wheelhouse. I liked the citrus frontend and balance. I can see where those who love the style would really like this. I would drink again and think it's a must try."
"Appearance is a can, I followed the instructions and I'm glad I did."
"Without a doubt this is my favorite beer. Although the instructions on the can say to drink from the can I have on occaision used a glass, which is my prefferred beer drinking method. When you first open one you are hit with a wonderful smell that is not matched by any other beer I have ever experienced. The flavor of this awesom double IPA is very hoppy yet slightly fruity at the same time. There is something else unique about the tast but I cannot put it into words. I guess I find it robust and strong but smooth at the same time. The limited avaiablity undoubtedly adds to the mystic of this beer. I usually only get to have some about twice a year. Whenever I drink other IPAs I always mentally compare them to Heady Topper and they alwasy fall short, even if they are very good. For me nothing tops Heady Topper!"
"I suggest getting multiples to try one from the can, one in glass. Although most of everything you can say about this beer has been said, my take way is hugely balanced beer with great hops to malt balance, up front citrus fades to pine then to a roasty malt."
"The beer pours a pumpkin hued orange that is very cloudy. Ecru colored head is well maintained with thick gobs of sticky lacing left with each sip. The scent is overwhelmingly hoppy and seems to span the entire hop spectrum without becoming muddled. Notes of pineapple, pine, orange citrus, pear and some background general scent of yeast. Very heady experience. "
Heady Topper 
"A friend gave this to me out of nowhere, he said it was canned within the week. "
"When a beer reaches the lofty heights of a Heady Topper it feels almost unfair to pen a review. After all, how could I possibly review it based solely on it's merits and deficiencies? Most everyone will either praise it's strengths whilst ignoring the faults or harp on flaws and turn a blind eye toward the many amazing things this drink does so superbly. "
"Very nice IPA. Fresh nose, with tons of citrus. The mouth feel has kind of a oil texture to it. This really is one of the best out there. I have been told that it is not as good if not fresh. I would actually like to try one a couple months old to taste the difference."
A great hop beer with a smooth finish. The best micro brew I have had yet. 
"I'll start by saying I am first and foremost a Belgian fan but wanted to try heady simply because it was number 1. Definitely one of the best IPAs I have ever had, beating out sculpin and stones enjoy by... The bitterness is non existent and you get swept by the grapefruit and pine flavors immediately. And even after settling a bit, the typical dry ipa bitterness never arrives. A must for every beer fan but with the understanding that there is a hype factor. Once again...I could think of many more Belgians I would prefer."
"Had side by side with Surly Abrasive and Pliny. By far finished last! Sorry, good for an east coast IPA, but no match for west coast. Pours a cloudy opaque orange color, odd chalky mouthfeel, and a little thick for the style. Prefer a cleaner, crisper, more bitter, hop forward IPA. I see why they want you to drink from the can, not a good looking beer at all! Taste not too far off. Not even in my top ten. Sorry."
"What can I say? This beer is the reason I joined BA today. Turned on by a friend, i am eager to begin trading for this and other great beers. Heady Topper embodies everything I look for in an IPA. Seriously, this beer has it all. Great aroma, piney, tropical fruit flavored goodness. There is an excellent balance to this machine. Kudos to all at The Alchemist, you have earned my business if you can ever get down to Atlanta!"
First time having this beer thanks to a trade. Soon as i took my first sip i got a blast of hops on the tongue. Hints of pine and grapefruit come through. This is simply one of the best if not the best DIPA out there. Zombie dust is a close second for me. cheers!
"This beer deserves to be at the top of the charts. An incredible refreshing double IPA. As soon as you crack the can open you are delighted with a burst of great smell, taste and hops. Citrus smell and flavor comes through well. The fact it taste so good out of can gets a big thumbs up."
"This is a useless review, I'm no critic but I love heady topper. Got a case the last canning day at their current location. No refined palate here, but I appreciate great beer and I consider ht a leader of the pack. I love the can, I prefer drinking out of a can across the board, and I am no stranger to Budweiser or miller lite. To me all these beers have a place, but as far as double IPA's go, this is my favorite so far."
Firts time i stop at the alchemist (driving from Ottawa Canada to Cape-Cod) they were out... i was mad. On the way home...they were still out of beer. I was really mad. The free samples were nice...but its more like torture.
"Stopped by the brewery as part of a tour around New England, having an onsite sample and picking up a case of cans."
OK we made the pilgrimage from the Capital District in NY to Vermont. The Alchemist will not be open to the public past 11/15/13 while they look for another place to open up. Yep it was worth the trip.
The OG of the DIPA world. Had 1 from the can and 1 from a glass.
Poured a hazy bronze hue with a two finger frothy white head. There was excellent retention and excellent lacing. 
"Heady Topper from The Alchemist is the counter-point to Pliny the Elder. It's brash, fun, and overpowering. This is not a subtle beer. Truth be told, I'm not sure I've had enough of it to rate it."
Acquired in a trade from member on HBT Forum.
"This review is based on a couple Headys I've have over the last week (following a great trip with the girl up to northern Vermont). Drank one from the can, another from a snifter."
The legendary Heady Topper! I was able to get my hands on this quite a few times at a local bar that was selling them in NYC. After having Pliny I was most definitely curious to see how heady ranked next to it. So....
"Served from the can approximately one week after the canning date. The beer was kept cold from the initial purchase. The smell when you first crack the can is one of the best smells I've experienced while enjoying beers. The perfect balance of hops hits your palate with perfect balance. When poured from the can, the color is slightly hazy and beautiful. Overall one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of having."
"I retried this beer this past weekend at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. Drank straight from the can. I still consider it the king of DIPA's. How this beer is so crushable yet 8% ABV is beyond me. Time always makes me forget. I'll try a Trillium or a Tree House here and there and think, is Heady really still #1? Every time I retry it I re-affirm ""yes. Yes it is."""
"Christmas Heady muled down from Vermont by my sister in law. Broke rule number one and poured it into a glass. Outstanding looking beer, not that clear watery look that many have, looks full and rich, orangish color, impressive head that stuck around and lacing was ideal. I know I am supposed to drink it from the can but it is a great looking beer. The smell is unreal, the citrus really jumps out at you. The flavor follows and is also incredible, the juicy citrus jumps out at you, real smooth except for the bitter. May be just a bit to much for me (not a hop head). Plus, the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue. Rich, full texture with great carbonation, the perfect amount. I did not notice any alcohol, it was an extremely easy to drink beer with the exception of the lingering bitterness. Not the top for me but I completely understand why the hop heads love it."
Tasted On: 11-01-2013
Wow. An outstanding beer. This really lived up to the hype (which is really saying something). I felt like I could truly taste the varietals of hops and it was magnificent. I am sold on this beer. One of the best I've had. My favorite part about this is that it says in the can to drink this straight from the can! This place is progressive and has fully embraced the superioriority of the can to the bottle.
This is a great beer to pick apart.
"Appearance - They say to drink it from the can, so that's what I did. Living fairly close by (in NH) I've had more than my fair share of Heady, and a few times I've shared it with friends that have poured it out. I've not seen the extreme cloudiness on these occasions, but you can definitely tell it is unfiltered."
Many thanks to shawnp for hooking me up with this one.
I FINALLY went to Vermont and I got the Heady Topper! I felt like a little kid once it was in my hands. This beer is the best thing since slice bread.. If you haven't had the Heady Topper find a way to get this beer in your hands...I went on Saturday October 26. They were sold out of the cans.. The lady who was handing out the samples told me on Monday they will have more for sale.. Once I walked in to the brewery on that Monday... Wowww!! You can smell the hops once you walk in.. The machines were cranking! Bottles we're being filled and my smile grew. I bought myself two 4 packs.. I'm happy with what I bought BUT something is telling me I'm going to have to drive from Boston back to VT - this time I'm grabbing a case.
Heady Topper is at the top of most DIPA lovers lists or beer aficionados lists and for good reason. 
"A regular at Max's brought in a can each day of Max's Hopfest (from notes, 8/16-18/13)"
"Appearance: Mysterious. No, I’m not trying to be cheesy. We drank it straight from the can, as suggested. Could see a little bit of golden liquid on the rim of the can as I drank it."
"Absolute perfection in a can. Strong grapefruit aroma, and taste does not deviate from the scent. Mouthful loaded with grapefruit and sweet hop goodness, with a smooth finish. Beer actually gets better with each passing sip and is extremely drinkable. Straight from the can is the way to go as instructed ."
"Trade from A generous trader. Thanks man!!!! Can poured to tulip so I can see it. Some sediment. This isn't super pretty, but the beautiful creaminess of the head brings the appearance up a bit, otherwise not a good look. Will go from can next time. Pours a hazy light golden copper color with just under one finger head. Big floral pineapple and grapefruit aromas, sweetness, mango. Yum. Flavor is heavier on the bitter pine up front, some earthy dirt (in a good way), with some beautiful tropical fruit lingering on the palate, and a pretty dry finish. Almost a creamy feel as I get through this. This highlights the tropical hops for sure. Slick mouthfeel but plenty of carbonation to lighten things up. Is this am excellent DIPA? Yes. Did it live up to the hype for me? Probably not. But very nice in a very different way from some other in the style. Would still likely go for Dreadnaught, Hopslam, Pliny, and Enjoy By before this one. But that's pretty good company. I will revisit tomorrow with a fresh palate to make sure, and try out of a can."
Served on tap in a Tulip Glass at the brewery as a sample.
"Poured into a tulip glass, Taste rated from the can"
"Canned early october. About 2 weeks old. I have had this numerous times, but thought i'd give it a proper review, fresh, at proper temperature. "
"One of the most amazing beers I have ever experienced. From the pour it looks great, a carmel brown. The smell is crisp hopps, the taste starts in one place and ends in another ( to me a sharp grapefruity finish), that leaves you ready to open the next one because the first one is gone! One of the best beers I have ever tasted."
"Thanks to Johnmichaelson and Kurmaraja! 2 cans of Heady in one week! I prefer the glass, and the brewery wants you to drink straight from the can. What do you do? Have them side-by-side! This will be a combined review from a straight pint glass, and the 16oz can, switching between sips as I watched the Talladega NASCAR race."
Wow I finally get to try the Topper!
"One of the best beers or let alone double ipa i have ever had very resiny sticky mouthfeel, balanced with citrusy piney hop flavors and a nice sweet subtle malt backbone. Very comparable to pliney the elder in taste maybe just a little more heavy and flavorful both really amazing."
Theres nothing I can say about this beer that hundreds of people haven't said before. It's that damn good. I've paid $10 a can and I gotta say I'd pay $20. Looking forward to finally making a trip up to Waterbury next year. Pro tip: Makes a great wedding present. Tuck that knowledge away.
"Here it is folks, the single most overrated beer in drinking history. I've been a beer fanatic for a decade and a half, and the beer drinking world has a lot to answer for on this one. The best beer in the world? What a joke. I wouldn't even put this in the top 10 of IPA's let alone beers of any style. "
This beer lives up to the reputation. Had a successful trade that landed me 6 of these beauties and I'm now sans HT. 
"Can was about 2 months old, thanks brian!"
"Appearance – Pours almost a shandy body. Murky, light yellow, lemonade, nice head, great retentions, about 2 fingers that lingers."
Thanks to my neighbors Nate and Erika for bringing this back for me. This is a Holy Grail beer that I have wanted to try for a long time now. 
This is the nectar of the Gods! Wow!
Look: Hazy opaque pale gold with a thick white head. Moderate activity and subtle lacing. 
"Fairly fresh, received in a trade. Should be less than 2 weeks old. I poured a little bit into a taster just to see appearance, the rest of the review will be from the can, as the brewer intended. "
"Drank it from the can as advised (6 days old) and also poured into pint glass. Lived up to the hype. Lugged some back to CA, drank it side-by-side with Pliny. In that pantheon. Loved visiting the brewery in Waterbury -- simply evil that it is essentially next door to Ben and Jerry's. Evil."
A:
"Poured from a pint can to a poco grande style glass; just enough to look at the body, drank the rest straight from the can. Hey it's right on the can to enjoy it that way!"
Thanks to jbaker67 for the can! Poured at fridge temp into a Tallgrass Brewing cervoise glass. 
"Finally got my hands on this guy. A bit poured into a pint glass, rest enjoyed out of the can. "
"Does HT really need another review saying how equally good and unattainable it is? Well I thought so, so here it is."
I can honestly say I bought at least 10 cases of Heady over the past year. Drank more of these than any other beer over the past 12 months. Love driving up from PA to Vermont. And also love sharing this amazing brew with people that never had it. Vermont beercations are amazing!
"Drank from the can. Did not pour into a glass, so I can not say what it looks like, but the can is very cool. My dad will love this addition to his beer can collection. Bittersweet grapefruit and dank hop resins dominate, I can already tell this drinks like juice. A bit of pineapple and mango are noticeable on the nose as well. On the first sip, I couldn't believe how complex a one dimensional beer could be. This beer really doesn't need a malt backbone, what a use of hops. Drinks so easy from the can."
"The Alchemist cannery is only 10 miles from my house and I have a case (or so) of this beer in my fridge at any one time... I am incredibly fortunate that it is my ""regular"". I frequented and severely miss the Alchemist Pub & Brewery that was destroyed by the flooding in downtown Waterbury, VT during Hurricane Irene. Heady Topper is a constant reminder of what a great brewery my good friends John and Jen Kimmich run. I hope that this beer remains BeerAdvocate's #1 beer ""forever""... :)"
"Consumed October 4th, 2013 from an undated can. Poured into a Samuel Adams ""perfect pint"" glass."
"First of all, I want to say that I am excited about finally tasting this beer. It has been on my hit-list for a year and, my stars, I was gifted a can this afternoon by a co-worker (danke schön, Mike). The only potential downside is that it was canned in June, it's October, and I have been cautioned by both John Kimmich and devotees to drink it immediately after canning. Any subsequent lapses in enthusiasm are likely owing to this shortcoming. "
I just made my monthly trip to The Alchemist and figured it is finally time to write a review.
Appearance: golden yellow with small white head (only poured a little bit into a glass)
"Canned only 3 days ago (!), this was an incredibly generous trade surprise from mtomlins and a beer I've been hoping to try for ages. It is just plain stunning and actually lives up to my (unduly high) expectations..."
Cracking open a fresh Heady...
"Received this can from my good friend DWitt. Good looking out, even though u r a g damn Sander. "
"Picked this baby up from a great friend at the Borefts Bier Fest! It's a little over a week since it was canned so it's super fresh. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a huge 2+ finger fluffy white head with decent retention and lacing. Fresh, dank, resiny hops totally dominate the nose along with some great perfumey, floral and citrus notes. This is one of those really special smelling beers that you'll always remember. The taste is just as big and bold. It starts off like the nose as a total fresh hop monster, full of resiny pine and bitter grapefruit along with some nice tropical notes. About midway through there's a measure of balance as some of the caramel malt sweetness emerges along with some orange peel, tangerine, and a bit of grassiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oddly creamy for an IPA. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable for such a big, hoppy beer. Overall, not sure it lived up to all the hype, but still one hell of a beer!"
"What else really needs to be said? Had a taste from the tap but reviewing based on 1 pint cans.Both are my first experiences with Heady. It's perfect. Beautiful pale hazy yellow when poured, which I did with 1 of 4 cans I've had so far. Delicious, smooth and flavor-filled. Hits all the right notes. Little floral, little citrus and a little pine lumped together into a spectacular punch of flavor. Spent 10 hrs in a car to bring this home and it was worth every second."
"Murky golden orange color with a fat layer of off-white foam on the surface. Deep, dank, fresh bag-o-hops smell...spicy, resinous pine, pungent, juicy citrus, and peaches. An almost toffee-ish malt profile lurks underneath. Huge hoppy flavor (obviously): fresh floral hop cones, grapefruit, pine needles, stone fruit, maybe some tropical fruit. Seems kind of like a lot of Simcoe to me. Dry, smooth,and textured. Bitter, but nothing crazy. This is a great, supremely hopped-up DIPA that manages to stay really drinkable. A bit too hyped up, but undeniably impressive."
"Religious experience. I went to the brewery on a Saturday, opens at 11am, and by that time there were, 40 people behind me, from all over the continent!"
Absolutely love this beer. Just had it for the first time in Vermont. I'm used to Belgians for this high of alcohol contents. Absolutely love the flowery smell.
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. 
"To date, one of the most enjoyable beers that I've ever drank."
This is everything a beer should be amazing drinkability great odor and taste this is just everything that I could possibly want in a beer experience. The presentation of the can is perfect and well worth the journey into the middle of no where Vermont. While 72 for a case may seem high I would be willing to spend over and over again.
Appearance: Nice hazy orange color. Very nice off-white head.
Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves lovely lacing.
First time having this brew. I must say it lived up to the hype for sure. great hoppy taste and not too bitter. very easily drinkable. I would choose this over any other ipa/dipa available. the only negative thing I can say about it is it's availability. I wish I didn't have to have it shipped out to Las Vegas! Cheers!
"Was everything I hoped it to be. Thank you Danny Mac for sharing! I wish I had just one more sip, then one more can. Everyone can write more descriptive reviews, I just wanted to tell about the experience. Read a ton of opinions and this was one of the few that I whole heartedly agree with. If you have it, I am jealous, if you can find it, count yer blessings! If you have an extra share it with a friend. Drink, be fat and happy all!"
"It's heady topper... everyone wants a piece of it. Here in burlington, people still stand in line for it and it sells out quite quickly when it hits the shelf. "
"A- Pours a medium bright orange golden color. Not quite brilliant, but far from dull in color. Big, frothy head that retains and laces tremendously. Hazy and beautiful in the glass."
"Poured from the can. Aroma is very strong, lots of floral hops. Pours a nice golden color and white head. Taste is very strong hops that take over the more you sip it. It is one of the cloudiest beers I have ever seen. You can taste the resin right away and it is not a bad thing! This is my favorite DIPA to date."
A can traded to me by a fellow BA. What a nice gesture! A 16 oz can of the top rated beer and they tell you to drink it from the can.
Special thanks to Jake Holland for providing this delicious beverage...
"I really don't feel the is anything I ""can"" add to this wonderful beer the only reason it feel short of perfect is because I can't drink any other beer with it, nothing before and nothing after. If I drink something before I simply don't enjoy heady as much and if I drink something after I lose the desire for beer. Other then that it is wonderful, But I have to session it by itself have 2 or 3 and call it a night."
"Appearance- Pours up a more than a fair amount of head and seems to have pretty good retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a hazy, pale to medium amber with weak grapefruit notes which glows a pale amber with hints of orange when held up to the light. Hazy but I haven't detected any of the infamous floaters. Some lacing is left behind. "
Cracked a can which was about 2 months old. Poured into a tulip glass.
"16oz can, thanks to Phyl21ca for getting this across the continent to me. If we are entreated to ""Drink from the Can!"", then why does the label illustration show the dude getting his mind literally blown ('heady topped?'), using a GLASS?"
"This was one of the great Craft Beer experiences that I've tasted. And after what my Mother-In-law went through to get it for me I had great expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. Great taste and finish. A beer that I could drink every day, if I could get enough."
"Lightly chilled 16 oz. can. Picked up last Wendesday outside Burlington, VT. Poured a couple oz. into a shaker to get a look at it, the rest stayed in the can as per the brewer's printed plea."
"Appearance: golden yellow with orange hues, white fizzy head, very hazy"
"I love this beer a lot and appreciate the fact that such a good beer is made in my home state, It will get you twisted pretty quick because to me I couldn't really taste the alcohol but instead the delicious floral hops. When I was at Nectar's bar, everyone had a Heady Topper!"
"Appearance was cloudy and golden with a coppery-orange hue; moderate, bone-colored, head retention."
Original review 9/8/13:
"Had this beer many times, but I still pour into a glass even though Alchemist says not too."
"General - I was in Albany, NY for the holiday weekend and made my friend drive 4 hours north to VT to get me a case of this before I even arrived. I've had extremely high expectations for this beer since reading all the reviews and never getting to try it. I drank it out of the can, just like the can says to do!"
"A: Hazy, orange body. Small fizzy bubbles. Moderate retention."
"I poured just a little bit into a glass, to see the color. It says to drink it from the can. It has a light burnt orange color it. The aroma is strong piney hops. The taste is a little bitter than the citrus comes in. At the end the hops bite your tongue like a rattlesnake. It leaves a bitter after taste and overall one hell of a beer."
I have this beer a lot as well as other IPAs out there and it still holds its rank as #1 in my book.
"A - Yellow-orange and hazy. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?"
"Thanks, Kristen."
"From the can distributed during the week of August 26, 2013. Sampled on September 1, 2013."
"16oz tallboy, purchased cans from the brewery."
Huge thanks to Phyl21ca for sending a 4 pack of these out together with some other awesome beers in a great trade. Review #200 - and some amazing beers left to try!
Big shout out to my fellow Beer Advocate Mikeypnh for the hookup on this one
"In short, lives up to the hype for sure. "
"Tasted it for the first time yesterday in the studios of VPT in Colchester, VT: MAMMAMIA! That thing knocked me off my socks! "
"Tasted on 11/11/11 from a can shared by ryan585, thanks Ryan. Pours murky orange with a very thin white head that leaves a thin collar of lace, with some chunky sediment. The nose is intense orange peel citrus, resin bitterness, chewable kids vitamins, caramel malt, and a touch of earthy yeast. The flavor is orange and grapefruit peel, bitter resin, chewable kids vitamins, the same earthy yeast, and just enough caramel malt to keep everything in balance. The body is medium with an oily texture, lighter than average carbonation, and a very long resin and citrus peel bitter finish."
"Can @ Dan’s house, courtesy of doodler. Huge thanks! Cloudy, yellow orange appearance with an orange tinged off white head. Slightly resiny, piney, organic hoppy, citrusy aroma. Very nice, piney, somewhat resiny, hoppy, tasty citrusy flavor. Awesome! "
Had this (along with other dipa's) at a East VS. West Dipa Head to Head Showdown I hosted on 8/27/13
I absolutely love this beer. The first time I had it I wasn't overly impressed. Since then it has grown on me and I love it. I had been shying away from IPA's and there were few DIPA's I really enjoyed. Since having Heady several times over the last month I keep drinking more and more DIPA's only to be disappointed that it doesn't live up to Heady. Some may match it in 1 or 2 area's but I don't think there is an IPA or any style I would rather drink than Heady.
"This beer is amazing and quite unlike most other beers I've had, even DIPA's."
"My first shot at HT and I have to say, it wasn't what I expected. I was expecting a hop bomb being a dipa at 8% abv but it wasn't. Definitely the most well balanced ipa/dipa I have ever had. Taste and mouth feel were definitely great (alcohol was very well hidden). Appearance and smell were very good but not the best. Overall it was an awesome beer and I can't wait to have it again!"
"I often mention how my opinion of a beer can affected even before I drink it because of what I have heard about it before hand. Heady Topper is definitely one that fits into the category. Being the highest ranked beer on this site, this brew was pretty hyped up in my head before hand. I am happy to say it didn't disappoint but I don't think it is quite worthy of being ranked as high as it is."
"Poured out of the can (you don't own me Jon kimmich) into an HT stemless glass. Pours cloudy, a few floaters, nice orange color. To me this beer has the perfect smell. So floral and citrusy. I go to the cannery if I'm in VT, even if they are out, mostly because of the aroma there. Taste is outstanding. So citrusy, with a very complementing bitterness. This beer is worth the 7 hour round trip i take just for a couple cases. There's a reason it's #1."
"I finally got my hands on this beer from a beer distributor on Long Island...and it was worth the money i spent on it...never took it out of the can as per the instructions on the can, so i couldn't even tell u what it looks like lol...the smell jumps out of the can and smacks u in the face, very orangey citrus and piney on the nose...the taste is legendary, like its reputation..for me the high carbonation carried the piney hop hues to the back of the mouth and completely distracts u of any alcohol that a high alcohol brew might be characteristic of...therefore it is ridiculously drinkable...one of the better beers u will try as advertised "
"Finally able to try this, thank you lucas1801. Pours a hazy golden orange color. Smells is heavy citrus, orange and tangerine. Taste is very citrusy kinda like the citrus notes in Jai Alai, not overly hoppy. Overall this beer is worth seeking out and unlike any other IPA I have had."
Poured into a snifter. 
"So here it is. Never thought I'd get a chance to try it, or if I did I'd have to pay a ton to get it, which I wouldn't at this point, so I guess this makes this a rare and valued occasion, for which I am indeed grateful. "
"Finally trying the famous Heady Topper, thanks to an awesome gift from Ljudsignal!"
Had at the Skinny Pancake at Burlington Airport
I have driven 3 and half hours just to get this beer. That's saying enough about how awesome it is. I just can't get enough of it!
"First off, thanks to mshull for trading this to me! My first Heady on my 31st birthday"
Poured a 5 oz. taster just to see the color.
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Thanks to Ben Warner for this unexpected treat.
"Drank from the can, poured just a sip or two to see what it looks like."
"16 oz. can picked up from the Alchemist cannery in Waterbury, VT. Drank from both the can, as instructed, and a New Belgium snifter."
Drinking straight from the can...will try pouring on the next one.
"This is my SH*T! I consume at least 2 per week. Luckily I live in Northern NY and can take the Ferry across the Lake to Vermont to get my hands on this beloved brew! YUM YUM YUM!! Although I have not actually been to the Alchemist them selves, I can get it at beverage depots and bars in Burlington VT."
Simply sublime all around.
Appearance:
Had a sampling of it at my local World of Beer with the owners who received it from a patron
Shared with a selfless coworker who held on to the can until we could share it.
poured/drank from a 16 oz can (poured a bit in goblet to test the contrast)
"I live in South Florida (not a place well known for it's beer) so I had to look northward to the second least populated state in the USA for great beer. I was begging my relatives, clients, Ebay posters and friends to find a way to get me a try since I saw that Heady was the world's top rated beer on Beer Advocate. Finally, one of my friends came thru and told me my prayers had been answered and a case was on its way last week. After inspecting the case to make sure all cans were on hand and in great shape I began my personal journey. I have now concluded that Heady Topper is far and away the finest quality beer made, should be deemed a national treasure and is the best tasting Imperial IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. As smooth as a great brew could be with hints of grapefruit,1st rate hops, blood orange citrus, delicate cream and subtle pine. I am truly fortunate to be able to share my case of Heady with my beer friends and hope you are able to find a way to get a few cans to savor yourself. Please let me know when you have finished your first can, if you feel the way I do send me a personal note. Cheers to all!"
The best IPA I have ever had! I mouthful of hops and a dry bitterness that stays in your taste buds minutes after each sip. 
Can 
made the haul up there t0o northern VT got there at 10:30 on a Monday line was around the building
Re-reviewing this beer... 
"Can. Hazy, yellow/straw liquid small to medium white/light off-white head. Aroma of fresh hops, grapefruit, citrus, cereal malt, lemon grass, orange peel, tangerines and blackberries. Awesome. Taste is dry and medium to high bitter with lots of fresh, hoppy notes of grass, grapefruit and tangerine. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Very well brewed DIPA. Love the fresh hoppy notes."
Drank from can as recommended and from tulip glass. Preferred the tulip glass as way more aroma was present. 
"A little old, about a month, I bough two four packs on my way through VT when I went to vacation in upstate New York, so my ratings will be heavily weighted on my original impressions. "
"Thanks, Cliff, for procuring me this highly sought-after brew. "
There's not much to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. It just doesn't get any better.
Headed up to Stowe VT next week and plan on buying plenty!
I wasn't sure if this beer could live up to all the hype...
"6/17/12. Tallboy shared by a dude in the BA Zhukov line. Nice pour - orange with a nice khaki head.. Wonderful hoppy aroma with lots of citrus and grapefruit, some malt backing. Nice hoppy flavor with plenty of sweet caramel backing up the bold citrus and grapefruit. Nice!"
Drink it out of the CAN!!! First of all; dont tell me how to drink my beer... 
Thanks to Liam for hooking up a few cans of this bad boy
"A - cloudy with chunks, yellowish-red in color. "
"2 month old can, poured into a glass. Hazy and golden in color. Huge pine and citrus on the nose. Taste: pine, citrus, some floral notes, and a slight cracker-y sweetness from the malt. Huge body for an IPA. The bitterness explodes on your tongue, yet doesn't linger. Finishes dry. Somehow easy to drink despite the hugeness."
"Hops, Hops, and more Hops. Bright gold, with an orange tint appearance. As can instructs, you have to drink it out of the can, and in turn reminds me of college beer nights while tasting much better. Extremely hoppy to the first taste, smooth but also foamy in your mouth, and finishes with a less bitter than expected after taste. Spoiled rotten to work in Montpelier where almost all significant restaurants carry Heady Topper now. Simply no debate, it is No. 1 for a reason. MUST TRY!!!"
I went to the beer shop in Waterbury and tried this beer. There is a reason this beer is rated as the best beer in America. It is the best beer I have ever had. It had a great taste. I wish everyone could try this beer. I wanted to buy a case but the were sold out.
Poured from a can into a brew fest tasting glass that holds 4 oz. The rest was consumed out of the can.
"Fresh beer, and one of the best of its kind. The one thing that I always look for is balance. This beer has beautiful balance! Is this the number one beer that I've ever had? I would have to disagree with it being ranked number one, but I would definitely drink again, and would rank in the top 20 of the ones that I've tried."
For the love of all that is holy!!! 
Thanks so much to Tom for this beautiful can of elusive goodness from vermont. 
"On my visit to Chicago, I stopped by Beer Temple with my companion and got an opportunity to meet the famed Christopher Quinn. As we approached the counter to inquire about any rare beers in his store a silver can caught our eye. Needless to say what luck to have walked in on this tasting. "
"16oz can; half poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass, half drank from the can"
"I was so happy to finally taste this 'mythical' beer that seems so hard to find. My uncle brought down 6 from Vermont and we compared side by side with Pliny the Elder. I decided to split the experience, half in a dog fish head tulip and the other half out of the can. "
"Lucky for me, a co-worker brought me a case back from vacation. "
"Pours a golden amber with a two-finger off-white head. No ""floaties"" that many reviewers speak of. Nice lacing. A complex and unique aroma. Redolent of pine, tropical fruit, citrus, and earthiness; the kind of earthiness you experience walking through the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert (for those old enough to remember the Dead). As it warms, there's a wonderfully faint floral aroma. Through all those hops one can still get a whiff of the sweet malt! Incredibly complex. The taste is very juicy, more fruit than pine. Tropical fruit hits the tongue first followed by citrus, mainly grapefruit, and dried apricot. Lots of caramel and biscuity malt flavors balance this hop bomb perfectly. Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a top two or three DIPA that is truly worth all the hype (and the aggravation to get it)!"
"A - Two-finger white head, leaves nice lacing, fairly resilient. Almost a neon yellow-orange pour, settling into the thickest, most opaque IPA I've ever seen.*"
"Appearance: (4.0) Poured from a can into a pint glass. Hazy, straw yellow color, with a one inch head that dissipates fairly quickly."
"Got in a trade thanks to Circlenine, cheers! "
"No real appearance, since I took the suggestion and drank directly from the can. However, I popped the top, and it immediately smelled like I was in the middle of Shenandoah Valley. One of my favorite places to go hiking/camping with my dad. Heady is clean, slightly piney, sweetly floral, and rather bright in aroma. The taste is really light for the 8% ABV. A great hop presence on the tongue, and sweet/bitter combination from the malt/hops. Surprisingly, the piney-ness of the hops isn’t bothering me. I typically don’t like that in my IPAs, and tend to stick towards brighter/more tropical offerings. Short duration on the tongue, which is making me drink this beer faster than I normally would have. My first HT thanks to a trade from lhteacher"
Had on-tap and in can numerous times during East Coast trip in May/June. This review is for the canned version.
Review 17JUL13
"First of all thank you to Tammy in Barre, Vermont for saving my homie that was in Massachusetts 4 packs of this special brew. If you're reading this [ever] you've got a place to drink here in Texas. "
"I had this recently out of two cans, unfortunately one was absolutely flat with no carbonation. The beer in general has a lovely little bubbled good amount of carbonation. It is actually one of the highlights of this mindblowing beer."
Drank this out of the can as the can directs the drink er to do.
What else can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? Very few beers actually live up to the hype - Heady Topper does. Im not one to stand in line for hours to get a case of beer but the stores around here serve me well enough. One of the finest beers in the world with out a doubt.
"16 oz. can gifted from a friend, unclear bottling date but about three weeks old (one week old when gifted at NHC2013), poured into my FFF Teku glass, drank 7/14/13 over an hour."
I am giving this review for both the can and on tap. I was able to go through Waterbury for a vacation through Vermont. 
"A forerunner of great things to come. Heady is the grandfather of the New England IPA movement. Hazy, fruity, and yes hoppy. A delicious concoction of tropical fruits and citrus rush in to start followed by a melding with a fantastic assortment of hops. Had multiple times over the years, and where some beers lose their edge to bigger and better beers, Heady is still near the top of my list."
"I just came back from a 3 day mini vacation from Vermont, I talked my wife into going to see this ""beautiful state"" we dragged our 16 year old boy with us, after 1 day in Vermont it was pretty obvious why we were there in the summer.... dad's lust for the ""Holy Grail "" The Alchemist brewery and heady topper.. We stayed at Green mountain inn ( very nice ) and did enjoy the mountain views at smugglers notch, anyway Heady topper was everything I hoped it would be. I was at the hotel's pub when I got my long awaited first can, my wife and son were looking at me like I was nuts, I cracked open the brew and low and behold it was liquid gold. Sorry for the not very scientific review, but it's that good!!"
"had this tonight for the first time . poured from can at a beer tasting at http://goo.gl/P2J7P .(good time,) one of the 3 best beers i have ever had . very floral aroma. nice bite. clear. clean. hoppy. favorable comparison to Stone Ruination IPA . this is my first review . i felt compelled to write it."
Poured from can
Got these via a trade with someone from New Hampshire so I'm not sure how fresh they are. I believe he bought them before he shipped them to me. My first impression was not that great for an IPA. It initially tasted just liked steeped hops. Almost like someone just made tea with a bag of hops. Maybe I was drinking it too cold. My second and third cans seemed much better. Maybe I just had to appreciate it more. I still think there are other better DIPA's out there in my opinion. If you love hops then this is the beer for you as it is all hops and nothing else.
"A: i poured about 1/3rd of the can into a snifter glass (despite the recomendation to drink from the can) to see the beer I'm drinking (you have to!). It poured with a half finger of bright white head that quickly fell leaving a dusting of tiny bubbles gracefully on the top and a slightly thicker edge around the glass. The beer was a murkey, cloudy pale orange to dark yellow color. Holding it to the light there was a soft glow around the edge, but the center was as dark and murkey as it was without a back light."
"You simply cannot beat this beer. It looks very cool in the silver can, it tastes amazing, hoppy with low bitterness, it smells gloriously fresh and somewhat citrusy. Smooth. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. It's quite delicious. At first I thought it was over ratted by the time I finished my can, I was converted."
"Poured with a good bit of head, definitely looks like there is some wheat malt in there. Beer itself is almost an orange color and is completely opaque. If I were to look at this without knowing what it was I would guess it was a hefeweizen. This isn't even a weakish opaqueness, this beer is opaque right up to the edge of the glass!"
Pours a two-finger slightly-yellowed clingy head over a cloudy and particulated puke-tan liquid. Smells of green onion and wild garlic (Summit hops) with pine and sharp grapefruit pith. Baby aspirin and lemony tropical fruits. Comes across as a blast of very fresh Summit hops.
"A: Drank from the can, very nice artwork!"
"A- poured only half into a glass to experience different flavors from can and glass. golden/orange in color very cloudy, unfiltered. Thick Fluffy white head. "
"Drove through Waterbury and stopped in. Monday at Noon there was a line out the door to get cases. Tried the beer first while in line. It was good, but nowhere near as dramatic as I was hoping for (Lawson's Double Sunshine has ruined me). Wife gave the green light for 2 cases, but after tasting opted for 1. Opened the first one later in the evening when home. This is the review."
"I have one person to thank for this mrKennedy what a brilliant unexpected bday present you are the man and I know they say drink out the can but this definitely deserves a glass and pours a cloudy pineapple juice hue with a fluffy cloud like three finger head and lacing everywhere looks so inviting,the smell is pineapples,piney hops,tangerines,grapefruit and a tonne of Valencia oranges,the mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and medium bodied with tastes of pineapples,mangoes,grapefruit,tangerines and finished with a soft citrus bittersweetness and overall what a sublime AIPA it's right up there with the best I've tried and just wish this and the rest of their range was available here cheers."
I am a stout lover at heart. I have never taken to the hop head beers out there... well that was until I got my first taste of Heady Topper. It is absolutely deserving of the number one beer on beeradvocate. 
A: Pours a hazy orange with a finger of beige head that fades into a thin layer with a little lacing.
"Okay, so this is my second Heady experience. My first one was during a bottle share with a good friend of mine, and what followed felt magical. I couldn’t believe the flavors I was tasting, and feeling, and comprehending."
"Canned just over a week ago. For this review I poured it into a snifter, I just need the aroma and carbonation release."
Popped the top on the can and was blown away by huge citrus and pine. The smell alone is worth the price of admission. 
"Was very excited to try this beer and wanted to see if it could live up to the hype. Obeyed what the can said and drank this out of the can, but poured a little out to see the color. It was a golden color with a little cloudiness."
First off thanks to my cousin Michael for shipping me a case of incredible North Eastern beers that incorporated a 4-pack of Heady Topper. He is dripping with beer karma indeed.
World class ipa not just for the hopheads but in general. Even if you do not like ipas you have to give this a try. It's like biting into a hoppy pineapple without a hint of its true abv. Simply amazing. Follow directions and do not pour in a glass...
"16 oz. can pours a cloudy, deep, golden color. About an inch of white head falls quickly to a dusting. (4.0)"
"Finally. Pours a hazy light orange. Crazy hoppy smell, citrusy. Taste is really nice. Hoppy, but light for the style. Citrusy. Mouthfeel is really nice n creamy. Overall, over rated. Very solid DIPA, top 5 for sure, but over rated. Num 1 in the world, I think not. Not as hoppy as most from 3 floyds. Seek out 3 floyds before you seek this out."
How do you approach what some say is the best beer on the planet?
Can. Poured some into a glass to see beer itself. Hazy orange color with a lot of hop particles.
Got two cans from MPLSbrewer. Decided to pour one for the review. 
"We visited The Alchemist's cannery today, and the pair we are cracking for this review were canned today. We will obey the demands from the can and drink straight from the vessel, but we first decant off an ounce or so to assess its appearance. The brew shows a hazy straw coloring, putting up a quick one finger head of lemon meringue colored foam, showing variability of bubble size, and nice retention. Lacing is tight and ridged, snaking the circumference of the glass. Haze is thick, but no outright sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The aroma is pungent, even from the hole in the can, giving fresh pineapple, white grape, apricot tang, fresh earthiness of clayed dirt, raw honey, clover flower, wet moss, cucumber skins, soft plastic bite, and distant farmhouse muskiness. These blend atop a solid base of crisp pale malts and raw barley, powdered sugar, and hop varietals of sticky nectars, citrics, and herbal depth. With warmth the booze comes out as well, but it is sweeter rather than burning and fusel. Our first impression is that the hops are explosive, fresh, and tangy, with drinkability for years, and an insanely cleansing and balanced finishing that leaves your mouth dripping wet with salivation for that next sip. As we taste, the flavor opens with raw honey sweetness, white sugars, sweet pear, pineapple, tangerine, and golden delicious fruitiness, brightly citric and bitterly herbal hops, flashes of lemon juiciness, faint brandy booziness, and pale, lightly toasted and powdered malts. The middle comes to a peak with dill weed, vegetal pepper metallics, biting plastics, and continued pear and blueberry fruitiness, along with the sweetest, most nectary hops of the sip. Tannic lemon teas and those crisp pales also rides high across the palate, pulling us into a finish with a hop profile most similar to the beginning of the sip, when held in the mouth. Here you get that fresh earthy and herbal hop bite, with black pepper and continued dill herbals, dripping pine sap, clove honey, honeysuckle florals, green twig, lemon rind tang, bready pales, faint rye crustiness, coiny metallic yeast, and light parsnip vegetals. The aftertaste breathes of crisp bready toastiness, clean pale malt sweetness, light rye twang, graphite, chalked yeastiness, aromatic mossy and musky rumbles, toasted pistachio nuts, bitter herbal hoppiness, and those sticky sweet nectary and lightly resiny hops. The body is medium, and carbonation is high, but not offensive or overly prickled. Each sip gives soft and syrupy slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop. The mouth is left foamy, coated, and dripping wet with salivation. There is mild puck from the hoppiness of it all, added to by alcohol, especially as the beer warms. The abv is appropriate, hardly noticed, and nicely contributory, and the beer drinks like water. "
Brought eight cans back from a trip to the cannery in March of 2013. 
"Bought a case of this from The Alchemist on Memorial Day, have been making my way through it over the past month. Sat down to do a couple proper reviews of it in the last week or so, so these notes are on cans that have ~3.5 weeks on them."
Thanks to JOSHMAN for this one (and three others)!
Big thanks to Dee at Bobby's Liquor for this one!
a) silver and black can with a neat logo :) its hard to judge this since the can so explicitly says to drink it from the can...not sure what a proper # rating would be since you can't actually see the beer.
"I recently had a chance to taste the legendary Heady Topper, and it was truly a ground breaking experience for me. This is the essence of what most IPA's strive to be, but come up a bit short. The aroma is floral and fruity in all the right ways, the head is moderate when poured, and the appearance is a thick, luscious, golden color with it's unfiltered qualities lending to it's bold appearance."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a stark white bubbly head. The aroma is great. The second the can pops you can smell the hops. The aroma is of piney hops and floral hops. It smells like an earthly flower shop. The taste follows suit, there is no ripe your face of bitterness just a great blended flavor. The malts are there as the backbone, but the hops play out with piney earthy hops up front before a floral and citrus hop flavor comes through at the end. The mouthfeel is perfect. Overall this beer is as good as advertised. A great beer a must try."
Poured a chug into pint glass just to see what it looked like. Drank rest out of can.
Tall boy can
"I knew I'd tick this one eventually without having to actively seek it out. Success! Thanks Dan for the share on your extra. 2 oz. into a tulip so I could mark the visuals and aroma, another 3-4 oz. straight from the can on June 14th, 2013."
The hype of this beer made me want it. Got it on a beer trade from a bloke in nj. Opened the can and dug my nose in it... So delicious. Super hop aroma and pine. Put a chug in my mouth and swished it around like scope and put it down. Then came. Nothing more.
The Alchemist Heady Topper
"I have been craving this beer ever since I heard about and through the generosity of fellow BAs, I am able to enjoy it multiple times."
"I have to say that I was impressed by this beer. I only managed to have a couple of sips since i was sharing the one can we found we a couple of friends but i found this beer to be very,. very enjoyable."
16 ounces of perfection. Amazing head and deep copper body. Smells of sticky hops and strong sweet malty goodness. 
"Reviewed from notes. Finally getting around to typing it up. Full disclosure, I drank a lot of Heady over a several month period and so my review ultimately takes into account my judgments across many samples."
"A: Golden honey brown colored body with a bubbly, rocky and creamy looking head. A nice retention ring is left behind, along with sticky lace on the walls. Unfiltered floaties are unmistakable in the body, as mentioned there might be should you pour this out. Really, they're just ugly and kill the looks of the beer. I can't help but think this is part of the reason they recommend drinking from the can (other than the hop aroma retention)."
473ml can served in a tulip (to take a look in the appearance) and also drunk from the can as suggested by the brewer.
An east coast DIPA trying to be an west coast DIPA. Pours a very cloudy light amber to dark golden color. A good carbonation with good retention through the tasting.
"The artwork ok the can itself is killer. Although it clearly states to drink straight from the can I opted instead to pour this one into a tulip to scope it out. Very hazy burnt orange in color, minimal head and lots of ""floaties"" that anyone whos done any research has been warned about. "
"Perfectly balanced IPA. Great Hoppy flavor, not overly bitter and very drinkable. The smell hits you when opening the can. The fruity/floral flavor hits your palate instantly and lasts. They recommend that you drink it out of the can, but I tried it both from can and glass and found no difference."
Sampled from a can in a standard pint glass. Thanks surge1311!
Appearance- Poured about 6oz into a snifter before drinking the rest from the can. Pours a hazy yellow-orange with an inch of head that quickly fades to a film of bubbles on the surface. Some sediment but this pour was off the top of the can so it isn't bad. 
"16 oz can courtesy of tommyguz pours an uber-hazed gold color with a stubborn, sticky off white head. It's money on retention and lacing."
"It may sound blasphemous, but really not much separates a lot of the top American IPAs - Sculpin, Resin, Double Jack, etc. They're extremely good, but somewhat similar. But Heady Topper has that x factor that keeps you wanting more. Not sure if it's the well-rounded mouthfeel or supremely fresh taste. It's just infinitely drinkable."
"I finally got my hands on some HT, and in one of the most unlikely places of all. A cheese and wine shop. Through word of mouth I got the scoop that there's some HT a few doors down, so I had to take the rest of the afternoon to dabble. "
"Great nose! Excellent hazy orange color with substantial white head. I had this from the can, but would love to try it on tap. The on-can instructions to drink it directly from the can are a little disconcerting for the average beer snob. We like glassware!"
"This is quite the beer with the only downside being the appearance, which is probably why the brewer suggests drinking it from the can. "
"A: Pours a very cloudy (mostly opaque) straw color, with 1.5 fingers of white head, composed of small and medium bubbles. The head dissolved into a think film pretty quickly. The little bit I poured did leave moderate+ lacing on the glass. Looks unfiltered, as there are some particulates in the ounce or so that I poured."
"One of my all time favorites. I've had this many times, but finally doing a proper review."
"Straight from can as recommended, 10 min out of the fridge."
"Excellent double IPA, there is a reason why this beer is #1. The smell, the taste, and the feel of this hoppy conconction of godliness are all there and do not disappoint. I'm hoping to get my hands on another 1 soon. Definitely worth the hype, cheers to Alchemist!"
Headed across the lake to Winooski Beverage to grab some of these bad boys. Needed to know if this beer lived up to the reviews. It did!
"Huge, huge, thanks to MrKennedy for this. Believe to be two-three weeks old max."
A - Drinking from a can so really can't rate appearance.
"With huge, massive thanks to the exceedingly generous Owen (MrKennedy)."
Canned on 6/3/2013; enjoyed on 6/6/2013.
"16oz can, huge thanks to Chris for sending this out here. Canned 15 May."
"Ok so this beer says to drink out of the can, so I am reviewing this beer drinking one from the can and one poured into a glass on a separate session. So the look isn't good. Tons of grainy sediment but to be fair they do tell you to keep it in the can for smell reasons, but after seeing it in a glass I call BS and say this is why they don't want you to see it. The smell is a hoppy citrus explosion. Might be the most citrus I've ever smelled in a beer. Most importantly the taste, and the taste is pretty good and smooth on some tastes and others a little more harsh. Never bad but kind of inconsistent taste through the beer. Overall, it's a good beer but not great, or for that matter the best rating on advocate. Double IPAs is perhaps the most competitive class of beers and I have definitely had better than this."
"Have to give a shout out to ffOpusx for sharing this brew. Great, multi-dimensional fresh hop nose that unfortunately doesn’t carry over into the flavor. The floaties are also extremely offputting, and simply suggesting that the beer be drunk out of the can doesn’t get Alchemist off the hook for such a shoddy presentation."
"A - Only because I poured the first can, I can report that the Heady Topper pours into a chalice the color of straw, hazy, and an ample white head."
"A big thanks to Roger at Bestway for GIVING me this beer on Sunday.I know it's snobbery but I can't drink beer out of a can,I hate myself but I just can't.Pours a murky kind of lemony tea looking with a thin white head,the color was hard to pinpoint.Pure hops in the nose,tropical fruit, citrus rind,deep pine resin,and sweet alcohol,all make for a volitile mix.Just hops and lots o' hops on the palate,pine resin,deep overripe tropical fruits,and some bitterness in the finish.It's oily as all get out and slick in the mouth.This beer is pretty damn raw and complex in the hop department to the hilt,bad ass.I love the hop burps!"
"Drank from the can, per its request. Having had it both ways, however, I can attest that my evaluation remains a perfect score regardless."
This beer reminded me a of a springtime night in Paris.
Found this little brewery while on vacation up in VT. This is by far one of the best Imperial IPA's I had. It's unfiltered and has an Extremely hoppy aroma with a great balance composure of grains. I didn't believe the Alchemist brewery beer hype in VT until I went there myself. It was unbelievable! Great imperial IPA!
Since the obvious reformulation of this once great beer it has become a harsh onion flavored mess of a product.
Got a case from zrab11! Cheers!
"I have been an IPA nut for years now and nothing has compared to Heady Topper. The combination of hop bitterness and citrus flavor with a great mouthfeel make it nearly a perfect beer. I first tried HT back in December and since then have been yearning for more. I have tried to consume more available IPAs but nothing has compared, even other world class beers such as Double Trouble and LagunitasSucks. So today I went up to VT with some friends and picked up 6 cases. No more worrying for me. Its a shame more cannot try this great beer."
"A buddy of mine brought this beer down from Vermont.. I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. The HOPS are fully vibrant and tasty. I have never drank anything as full bodied, as at times I did not believe that a beer so wonderful could be crafted in the USA. However, I am in love with this beer.. I am hoping to have it again one day."
Finally got my hands on a 4-pack of cans. Enjoying my first as I write this review. I think I'm in love.
"Bought from a Charity Auction with the proceeds going to ""Open the Taps"": A grassroots organization of Texas craft beer consumers."
"Excellent in a manner I don't need to explicate, since everyone else has already done that. It's not, however, the beer beer I've ever had, nor even the best recent-vintage IPA. The hop profile is wonderfully vareigated and citrusy, but also gets a bit unpleasantly heavy in the back end. The malt is totally subordinate to the hops--as is customary for this new style of IPA--but in order for this to work the hop profile must balance itself perfectly. Heady's doesn't. It comes close, and the beer is still a joy, but it's not quite perfect."
Absolutely love me some Topper. This is by far one of the best beers that I have had. The only other beer in my opinion is the triple play ipa from Lawsons. They upped their production so its pretty easy to get. Still sells out the day of delivery though..
Canned 5/15
"Received in a trade from Jeremy6566. Thanks for letting me get my first taste of Heady, greatly appreciated. Poured a little from the can just to see what it looks like, and consumed the rest from the can as advised."
Picked up a few cases from the brewery this morning. Had first can with my dad this afternoon.
"16oz can, poured into a glass for the purposes of reviewing in comparison to other DIPAs, even though they say to drink it from the can."
"A: Hazy, golden yellow with a fluffy, white head. Gets lumpy with some head retention. Some good lace."
"Drank out of a can because it told me to, canned the day before. huge shoutout to bringing this to Boston after a depressing news release from alchemist. "
Wow. I kept reading the hype but finally got some of this. What an incredible beer. The aroma from the can is full....but not overpowering. The taste....is refreshing. So refreshing. The aftertaste is a wonderful complement. The ranking of this beer is not hype. I am half way through the can and know I would drive a far distance to load up on this.
"Review from notes accumulated while going through a case of HT over 4 weeks. First can was 4 days old, last can was right around a month. Mostly poured into tulips, but had a few straight from the can, too."
"Drinking from a 16 ounce can, per the can's request. Thanks for this one Cheesemoose. No freshness date. I'm told that this is a ""fresh"" can. Still not sure why everyone isn't dating their beers. Popped the can, aroma is bursting out of the little hole, pine, grapefruit, packed full of hops, awesome aroma. Taste is resinous and flavorful. Mainly grapefruit but notes of grass and pine. Totally juiced with flavor. Even the burps taste good."
Can &gt; 2xIPA Glass
I've been lucky enough to have this both right out of the can (as suggested) and poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Huge thanks to my buddy Doug and my co-worker Zach for hooking me up two separate times with this gem. This review is from a 5 day old can that was consumed half in a glass and half in the can...
Had an unexpected opportunity to buy this from someone so jumped on it. Never thought I'd get a chance.
"I didn't see the beer in a glass as I drank it from the can as recommended, but I imagine it is beautiful judging from the smell. I also drank it a little on the cold side... to thirsty to wait. Taste is fruitful and as smooth as in Imp IPA gets. Hoppy as hell in the best way. Again, very smooth. I drink IPA's 90% of the time and I cant say I have had a better beer."
Heady is the real deal. 
"Very smooth on the mouthfeel with excellent golden color. Very complex flavors, including a slight metallic taste which is common to IPA's of this type. Overall, excellent in all categories. The brewer encourages one to drink from the can, which isn't typical, but definitely adds to the experience."
"A - Golden/Amber, hazy, 2+ inches big thick fluffy head, light patchy lacing, light carbonation rising, large amount of yeast."
Poured into a tulip
"Managed to get 2 cans of this thanks to the kindness of another BA. This is a quick review based on drinking the first one straight outta the can, as directed by said can. I'll review again out of a glass with the next one. No discernible freshness or 'drink by' date to be found."
"I wish this beer was a fruit or a vitamin. I wish it was a soap. I wish it was my girlfriend. I wish it was my job. I wish I needed it to live. I wish it wasn't so hard to come across. I want a swimming pool full of Heady Topper that I can freeze in the winter and skate on. I would move to Vermont for this beer. If there is a better beer regularly available on this planet, please by all means let me know of it."
Got to try this for the first time last night at an Allagash tasting event at Decicco's in Brewster. 
I had a customer give me a can of Heady last year. Split it with one of my coworkers and we both just looked at each other with mouths open before both exclaiming how good it was. I picked up my share at the brewery little over a week ago and now it's time for a full review.
"16oz can with about the first 1/4 drank out of the can, the rest poured into a FFF teku glass and consumed today 5/10/13. Thanks to shagens for the opportunity to drink this 1.5-2 week old Heady."
16oz can - Started drinking right from the can and then poured into an oversized stemmed tulip.
I've had this beer out of the can and now straight from the can. Less than 2 week old can.
pint can half poured into sam adams perfect glass and half in can.
the look outside of the can is super hazy....but what do you expect with this many hops! the foamy light head persisted till the end of the glass.
"i searched low and high for this bad boy. i listened to the directions and drank straight from the can. no idea how old it was when i got it. IPA's are my go to all the time, and this thing is awesome. i will say not worth the $15 a can ive seen charged for it, but i'd drop an easy $8 on it."
Had a real hard time getting this beer. A friend hooked me up with 1 can from his 4 pack.
"I'm so glad that angrybabboon could provide me plenty of these for the coming weeks. I've already had this once, but I'm reviewing it today 15 days since canning day - about the widely considered perfect time to drink this. For this review, I got a bit experimental. I love how this is in the can, but I poured it alongside in a glass and reviewed both side by side - half in the glass, with the other half in the can. Poured into a teku glass."
"My homeboy Javier at Vendome Wine and Spirits in Placentia had a can of this. He knows to go to the backroom where he keeps all his exclusive collection when I arrive. He brought a can of this out and I asked him what he would trade for it. He said he would take $4. What a steal! I shared it with my other homeboys at Art and Craft Brews (and homegirls). They all got excited when I showed up with it. You should have seen their eyes open up and mouth the words Oh My God! So here is my review, trying my very best not to be biased since I'm west coast and the west is the best..."
Having had this beer on multiple occasions...I can not say enough about Heady Topper. When compared to the other top DIPA's I've had there is a few traits that set this beer apart from the rest. The main two are its balance and drink-ability. It is an unrelenting wave of hops across the palate yet still has you coming back for more. 
"This is one well hyped beer. Usually that would make for some disappointment, however this one lives up to the hype... Almost. I had a friend from NH ship out a 4 pack about six months ago, of which I distributed 3 and drank one. I have just had a case shipped out, and am enjoying the rare nice weather here with this beer."
Oh man look out for the hype train!!! ;)
"Drank from the can itself, but served a portion of it unto a 3 ounce snifter for appearance purposes. "
"Poured into glass despite what the can said, super hazy with lots of bits and what looks like hop bits floating around in a bright orange glow. Sticky bright white head. Tons of resinous hops on the nose. Grapefruit pine citrus and floral."
"Canned May 1, reviewed May 4. Poured into HF stemware and also had a few straight from the can. From notes. Minor updates from mid-November. Minor updates added in November."
Cans received from a fellow BA bud 5/4/13. Believed to be within a couple weeks of being canned.
"A-Drank from the can per Alchemist's suggestion, but I'm sure it looks fine."
"16oz Tall Boy purchased from the cannery hours earlier. Consumed from the can. Appearance is a murky dishwater color with sediment. Aroma is uber hoppy. Big grapefruit with sweet citrus and tropical fruits. Outstanding. Taste mirrors the aroma. Lots of hoppy goodness. Plenty of grapefruit along with citrus peel and hints of pine towards the end. Tropical notes as well. Pineapple. Dry, oily mouthfeel. Bitter and delicious. Highly drinkable. Amazing brew. Overall, hype warranted."
"I was able to have this on-tap at the brewery when I went to pick-up some cases, and have had a couple directly from the can as well as in a snifter. "
"Long awaited, and well worth the wait! A friend brought me back a can from a trip to Vermont...a very good friend indeed!"
This is simply a great beer. 
"No Bottle date( it is two week's old, I had a buddy pick it up at the brewery in Vermont, big thanks to IPAkindaguy)"
"A: Pours a rich orange color, with a nice inch thick white head. Tons of sediment floating in the glass. Gives the appearance that they're suspended in a jello mold. Not the most appetizing start."
Doing this from memory so my rating counts. Haven't had this in a year. But from what I remember the smell when you open the can is heavenly. Tropical fruit and pine. The taste is a mix of citrus fruits and peaches with a nice resiny pine bitterness. I'm a huge fan of both the fruitiness and pine mix so this is perfect for me. Fresh Heady is great but it gets better if you wait a month or so to consume.
Against the demands written on the can I poured it into two wine glasses and shared with Steve 28/4/13
"The beer is excellent overall. A phenomenal nose of citrus starts it off, smooth citrus flavors, cooling and slightly sweet touch the front and mid palate with a trumpet of hoppiness on the finish. A very inviting, thirst quenching, taste-bud delighting IPA."
"This beer is hard to get but well worth it if you can. Pours cloudy golden (yes I know you should drink from the can). Smell is spicy fruit and woodsy. Taste has unreal with banana, pine, peppery but with a great mouthfeel and aftertaste that lingers in a good way. A bit more carbonation and aftertaste than Pliny but in a good way. I think it slightly edges out Pliny but both are amazing"
Appearance-
"Pours a deep orange almost amber or brown with a frothy off white two finger head leaving supreme lacing down the glass. Smells of pineapple, tropical fruits and a little bit of caramel. Everything about this beer is fantastic so far. Strong citrus flavors hit at the front of the tongue balanced out in the middle with some caramel malt. Finishes with a light piney resin bitterness. A little bit sappy and good carbonation levels."
"Heady Topper-The Alchemist-Vermont. Ale. Alc. 8% by Vol.,1 pint."
"Poured it into a tulip, glad I did even with the floaties.. It was quite tasty, I even drank the protein globs. Worth it. Would love to get a hold of another can asap.. I would drink it from the can itself on the next try. I love this beer, it deserves the 100 rating it has earned."
"I know nothing of reviews. All I know is that I heard about this beer a month ago. I live in NY and decided to take a road trip to get some at 4+ hours away. To find out they were sold out. Sold out. What brewery sells out? One that has great beer! Had a sample, it was good, went home. Returned a month later, bought a couple of cases, sent some to friends, all are happy. I've tried from both can and glass. From the can, it has a bit sharper taste/feel. What I didnt like from the can is that you couldnt smell it as well. From the glass, a bit less carbonated, much better smell, and an excellent drink. Color? Who cares? Cloudy, very little sediment. You dont look at it, you drink it! You CANNOT have just one to make a review. Give your palette time. Have 3 or 4 (yes, its ok!!) and then review it. This beer gets better each and every time. As someone else said, its like biting into a grapefruit, and like the can says, its wave after wave of hoppyness. Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Be patient, get a 4 pack, and do an informed review. You wont be disappointed! I can't wait for my next road trip! And... they are compassionate! They are donating some beer to my tribute race to a late friend. I will never forget that. Nothing like a company with a heart and compassion and PASSION!"
So freaking excited to finally try this!
"This is a combo review since I've had the privilege of tasting this on-tap at the cannery, from the can, and from The Alchemist-branded IPA glass."
This was a bucket list beer for me that was well worth the hype. I really hope to get some more in a future beer trade. 
beer is heaven. It's fantastic on tap and one of the best canned dipas out there. Makes my Vermont pilgrimage to my grandmoms place in vt that much better.
"I was a sucker for the hype of this beer. I had tried a full gamut of attempts to acquire it from Wisconsin, but alas all of my attempts failed. Until roughly a month later my wife let me know she had a friend whose family was in Vermont at the time and that they were willing to pick some up and drive it back for me. After visiting 3 liquor stores that were completely sold out they found the miracle brew and brought back 16 cans in a cooler of ice they repeatedly replenished to ensure it never got warm. When it arrived my wife, my friend and I took a moment to enjoy the moment and shared 1 can. Despite being directed to drink it only out of the can we each poured a glass and were in awe of its hazy golden body. The first sip told us everything we needed to know. The rich full bodied taste was complimented with a smooth finish for an IPA bragging a bold 8.0% abv. I won't get into the specifics because there are many others more qualified to do so, but what I will say is that everyone who can appreciate the complexities and flavor of real beer needs to have this at some point in their life."
"This particular can was sent to me by JSBILK, after he picked it up at the cannery six days ago. Poured from a 16 oz. tallboy can into a tulip glass. I know I know, I'm supposed to drink it from the can, but I never was very good at following directions."
"A: Glorious murky dark amber pour, with big white rocky head that held for a bit. This is what a DIPA should look like!"
"This is a wonderful local beer! Its wonderful to be able to go to the brewery to purchase it, so much more personal than just picking it up in the grocery store. The beer is super hoppy and only comes in a can. The second you enter its brewery, you can just smell HOPS! This is the best double IPA I've ever had."
"After having Maine Brew Co. Lunch, I just don't get why this is #1"
This is my second - thanks to SDStoneEnthusiast! The first I poured into an English pint glass and followed directions for the second (drank from the can). I understand now why they are so adamant about drinking from the can - such a difference.
Poured from can into a tulip. Pours a clear gold color with a very foamy head.
"A: Perfect looking unfiltered IPA. Completely opaque due to dense haze - the color is a beautiful blend of sunshine and orange juice. A nice, slightly off white head coats the top of the beer and leaves great sticky lacing."
"After several cans, time for a review."
"Poured out of a can, 1 day after canning."
Just straight up awesome.
So I've had Heady Topper before. Figured I'd finally review it. This review is going to be pretty harsh since I drink PtE regularly on tap at the pub.
"16 oz can poured into my snifter. Huge thanks to Urbancaver for sending four of these, along with some KRE and HF. Good trade, let's do it again. Can is seventeen days old."
"First off, many thanks to SammyJaxxxx who sent me some of this out of the blue."
"I will agree with what's been said - this isn't the prettiest beer. But of the reviewing categories, it's certainly the least important factor to me. Drank mostly from the can, but poured a bit into a tulip to see what it looks like. Wonderful hop aroma and taste. It's easy to be disappointed by heavily-hyped beers but this doesn't disappoint."
"poured half into a mini tulip, drinking the rest from the can."
16 oz. can directly from the vessel to my mouth. I poured a fraction for appearance.
Review is done on can that was picked up from Alchemist and delivered with less than 2 weeks on it. Ratings are done from beer out of can as is intended to be drank. 
"The first words I heard about this from a cicerone buddy was ""please, don't drink it from the can like they say."" So, I poured 80% into a glass and left the rest in the can. After it hit the glass, I understood the desire for the can. The unfiltered, resin-floating view was less than flattering. But, I figured, two million people can't all be wrong. So I took a whiff, and enjoyed the crisp, apricot notes coming back at me. Nothing piney, no citrus, just clean. Next was where the rubber meets the road - the taste. My wife summed it up best, when she said ""wow, an IPA I wouldn't have to pair with food to drink!"" I absolutely agree. It's perfectly brewed, and is surely the best, most balanced IPA I've ever had. First taste threatens to turn into piney hops in your mouth, yet never does. It just slides away, leaving you with a tasty, refreshing treat that doesn't stay past its welcome. Now I know why this is such a revered brew, and why people love to have more than one at a time. It's just that inviting, and one I wish was closer to me in availability."
No can date but I know it's pretty fresh from the source. Drank about half from the can as it says to do so numerous times. Poured the other half into a DFH snifter.
"Look: hazy and light orange, nice lingering head"
"Poured into a tulip, no I didn't leave it in the can. "
"April 14th, 2013"
"Heavenly. The stuff you dream about. Like anything else in VT, very, very fresh. I had it at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury on tap. Haven't stopped thinking about it since. I'll be with everyone else, on the road to VT just to get some as it's only available there. It's that good."
"I'm enjoying a Heady Topper right now. All around, its an incredible drink. It's become the beer that I judge other beers against. The flavor is bone deep, The aftertaste stays with me for minutes. When swishing it around in my mouth it turns into this delicious creamy foam. Its what I want other beers to taste like. Man, this is the real deal. I can't think of anything I don't like about the stuff."
"No date on the can, drank the first half from the can, poured second half into a snifter. "
I've tried many many IPAs and there's only 1 that has come close to Heady. It really is the most amazingly over the top yet balanced IPA I've ever tried.
Thanks to sirsteve42 for the trade.
"Finally got around to writing the full review of this guy. I'm glad I waited; now I have a full mode of comparison after trying some of, what I consider to be, the best iipas out there (DS, S&S4, Ephraim, and Abner). Beer pours hazy amber into a Duvel tulip. Has a slight red glow."
"Living in San Francisco (a couple of miles from Toronado) I've been privy to a lot of ""West Coast IPAs,"" PtE, PtY, etc. The Heady Topper defiantly can hold it's own in this category and tak ehte top spot in the Top 250. "
"Had it first from the can in VT, once more in PA."
I thought my first full review should follow my first can of Heady. Thanks to patric11 for the trade on this one. Was told it was picked up from the brewery on 8/2/2013.
I made it up to Waterbury last weekend and had my first (and 5th) Heady Topper on that visit. I went into the weekend figuring it couldn't be as good as all the hype. I also doubted whether drinking anything out of a can would be one of my best beer drinking experiences. I was blown away by how great this tasted and by how drinkable it was. I had a game plan to try the first one in the can (per the instructions on the can) and then try one in a glass so I could see what I was drinking...I scrapped this plan after tasting how good the first one was in the can. The rest of my tastes were directly from the can. Apparently there are only two places that serve this beer on draft (the brewery and the Prohibition Pig)....the rest of the places in town serve it in a can (when they can get it). 
"Though a very good IPA, I wouldn't consider HT in the same breath as either Pliny. I think with this beer we have an extreme case of confirmation bias. I can think of 5 or 6 other beers I'd rather drink. I drank my first HT a couple hours after it was canned."
Poured into a goblet style glass also sipped from the can &lt;not recommended
Poured gently into a pint glass
"This is not a balanced beer by any means. If you're a hops lover, this beer certainly celebrates it like no other. It's almost comical and whimsical if I had to think of fundamental words to describe it. When you first crack open the can, you get hit with a sledgehammer of aroma; notes of citrus and pine hit you hardest. With every sip, the bitterness provides for a lingering complexity that makes this beer unique."
"A - (only poured a little out to see) cloudy, kinda apple juicey, small white head, but since your supposed to drink it outa the can, amazing can art, really cool looking and nice write up on the beer."
Big thanks to warnerry for supplying!
Big thanks to Trevor at Pinnochio's for this very surprising gift!
"After much searching I finally got a can of this at The Churchville Inn. Poured into a tulip, a very hazy golden color with alot of hop sediment at the bottom of the glass. Left a nice two finger heading with soapy rings left over after every sip. A non-stop fizzing action from the bottom of the glass to the surface."
"After receiving this in a generous pre-wedding gift-box of beers from a friend, I too neglected the bold warning to only drink this straight out of the can. I really wanted to see the beer I was drinking so I busted out a frosted mug for the occasion."
"I also didn't buy into the hype of ""Drink it from the Can"" because I wanted to see what I was working with. I can see why they wanted me to though, because there was a ton of gnarly looking sediment in my glass when it was all said and done."
"Outstanding in every respect, fresh and wonderfully aromatic. Little cloudy, so there's that. "
Straight from the can.
"I was hoping to find the Holy Grail of beers but it wasn't quite there. Doing as they say and drinking it from the can, you can't really gauge the appearance. Quite smooth and complex but I find Stone's Enjoy By a bit better to my taste. Heading to San Fran in the summer. Hoping that Pliny the Elder can match the hype."
My first Heady Topper
"A: poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass, orange amber with a huge white head that lingers leaving great lacing, very cloudy with floaties"
Happy to say I'm no longer a Heady Topper virgin. I live in CT and a friend made the trip to VT recently and grabbed ONE can for me. Best IPA I've ever had. It set the bar impossibly high for any other IPA out there. The freshest and most incredible hops in this brew. Amazing stuff.
Thanks to kojevergas for this one!
"Not following the instructions listed on the can, I poured into a tulip. Canned within the week."
A: Poured a white foam which dissipated slowly with excellent lacing. Nice golden color and a bit cloudy.
"I can't report much on appearance because I tried this as directed - from the can. Nose was citrus - grapefruit, mango and pineapple along with some pine, grassiness and floral elements. Taste followed with big citrus flavors, especially grapefruit and orange, but with a biscuity, caramel malt for balance. Bitterness was there but not overwhelming. It predominates in the aftertaste as well, along with pine oil and honey. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated. There is little to no alcohol burn. I can understand why so many people love this beer…it was great…just not my all-time favorite, as it is for so many."
A - Instructed to drink from the can - have never viewed the beer. Appearance of can has cool illustration of man with hair on hop fire.
"Ok, another double IPA. Hoppy, we get it right? So what is so great abut THIS Ipa? If you were to break the rules and not ""drink it IMMEDIATELY out of the can"" you end up with a foggy IPA with chunks of hop pellets to chew on while they add to the hoppiness. As it sits, the trub gathers as gravity wins the battle to the bottom of my glass. Don't get me wrong, the hop particles that are suspended add a decent profile to the beer, but at what cost? I think it would be great as a ""harvest IPA"" if vegetal matter was the intention but there are another 11.5 months to use your hops in that case. "
"First time I had I received it in a Reddit trade two weeks before my Vermont trip, but then consumed in glorious excess directly from the source in Waterbury."
poured 16oz can into Duvel tulip.
"Easily one of the best DIPAs in the world. Do whatever it takes to get this beer, then be sure to enjoy it quickly!"
can &lt;7 days old. 
Hands down the most amazing experience I have ever had with a beer. My first taste - likened to the first time I ever...well you know....I don't think I have to elaborate
Consumed from a 16 ounce can. Canned 6 March 2013. I poured an ounce or two into a Glencairn glass for purposes of appearance and smell.
On a recent trip to Burlington went to American Farmhouse which had it.... By luck we were able to do live taste tests with some other DIPAs most notibly Stone 4/1 enjoy by
Finally!
"A-the overall appearance of Heady isn't perfect but when does that matter when the beer is this fabulous, poured a golden honey color slightly cloudy with a monster head that refused to dissipate!"
A: Enjoyed a Heady a few weeks ago poured in a glass (from same batch) and wrote down notes on appearance. Poured a white foam which dissipated slowly with excellent lacing. Nice golden color and a bit cloudy.
A: drank most of it from the can poured a small amount to see what it looked like Poured a golden color with a sight haze about 1 finger of bright white head with a good amount of lacing
"Poured a bit into a tulip, had most straight from the can"
"9 day old can poured into a snifter for inspection (inductions be damned!). Very hazy, between straw and copper in color. Fluffy head which recedes to a thin cap. Pretty."
"OK, while everyone else in Philly is drinking Pliny the Younger today, I decided to avoid the crowds and review this beauty. I sampled this a few weeks ago, and really wanted to NOT like this beer so much. But that is impossible. Anyone who likes beer would fall in love with this..."
"I reviewed this beer out of a can without pouring it so I do not having any appearance notes. I have had a sampling of this once before, poured into a glass and the color was a deep orange or amber. Pretty hazy as well."
16oz. tall silver bullet can with a sweet ass picture. The label is that of a bearded scientist chugging a beer with his hair bursting with hop buds. It's something you need to see for yourself. The back of the can has a lengthy paragraph about the beer and the Government warning. A brewed on or canned on date would have been very helpful. Poured into a Cycle Brewing Snifter. 
Reviewed from notes from 3/31/13
"Pint can, 1/2 drank from can, 1/2 poured into a tulip. Probably about a month old, so could be fresher."
"Props to my brother in law for snagging this for me. I've now had Pliny, Heady and Hoslam in one winter. Anyway, this stuff looks hazy, smells dank and piney. Tastes bitter pine and I'm not sure what else. Great stuff. Wish I could get it all the time."
"Per their request, drank it out of the can. Guess I'll have to rate the appearance of the can. Silvery and tall, not the best logo I've ever seen but not too bad. "
I took a trip to Vermont with my brother and a friend of mine from Boston for a guys day out. This beer was well worth the 3 hour drive. Normally prefer bottles over cans but this beer was outstanding.
"Easily in my top 5 Imperial IPA's out there- wonderful aroma every time I pop the can piney and fruity in nature. Taste matches the smell- piney undertones and strong citrus overtones- I generally pick up on grapefruit, pineapple, orange and tangerine.Just the right amount of malty goodness makes this heady retardedly drinkable. If you can get your hands on this brew do so without a second guess- no chance you will ever regret it!"
"A: tried from the can initially (mandated on the can) - ""cold but not ice cold"" - but then gave in - I had to see what I'm drinking (we are visual creatures): cloudy medium gold beer kicked up a couple of fingers of off-white head from a near-center pour into a tulip. Left some lace behind."
16 ounce can poured into a snifter. Big thanks to st9647v3 for this opportunity.
"OK, here we go. The unofficial holy grail of IPAs. Great appreciation goes out to SatlyMalty for this excellent surprise! Poured into a snifter (screw what the can says). The code on the can is apparently not a freshness date."
"Drink it from the can...yup, follow the directions printed on the top of the can. The hops are incredible, spicy and super floral. There is plenty of malt to back up the massive amount of hops and it keeps the beer in balance. No question, this certainly ranks up there on the list of greatest beers ever enjoyed. If you are ever in the area of Northern VT and have a chance to pick some up, don't think, just buy it!"
Poured out into a glass
Date: 02/13/2013
"A- this beer is quite ugly, but like an ugly puppy and you still love it"
a: orange/light amber with a creamy off-white head. from what i'd read i was scared of huge fugly floaties. instead i only see some fine particulates in this hazy beer. i can't ding it for being unfiltered.
"Poured from the can into a proper glass. Since any half knowledgeable beer geek sees right past the whole ""drink it from the can to trap all those hop aromas"" BS. Yeah, I'd like to smell- and hence taste- my beets."
A: The beer pours a hazy golden body with a thin white head that quickly fades. It also las some random floaties. 
Poured a can into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
"There are several things that make me proud to be from Vermont. This is one of them. This is a hoppy beer, but not one that makes you choke. John Kimmich, the brewer, has somehow taken an extremely hoppy beer and made it so palatable that even people who don't typically like IPA's can enjoy it. I miss the Alchemist of old (Wild Child, Holy Cow, Ouroboros, etc) and hope that Kimmich decides to can those in the future. You can't go wrong with the Alchemist."
Appearance:
Perfect in lots of ways. The explosion of hoppy goodness is over the top. I've only had it fresh and oh boy is it good. Thought about letting some age but then I read on the can drink it young so here's to all of you cheers! 
"Really wanted to love this. Maybe something happened on the long trip from VT to CT, but man was it just...okay. Smells fantastic, looks good enough, but it just doesn't taste as good as other IPAs I've had. I hope to give it another shot soon. It probably tastes better than I'm giving it credit for, I think I just got my expectations too high...you know for the #1 rated beer here."
Drank 1-31-13
Thanks again to Rutager. 
"Does appearance include the can? Canned beer with a message ""Drink from the Can"" on it and you know you have a brewer with a sense of humor. If I did that than how do I know what the true appearance is? Pour it into a glass and see the beautiful iridescent orange and a bright white head."
Drinking directly from the can as instructed. 
Best double ipa around. The nose punches you in the face. I could drink this beer all day even at the higher abv. So much pine. Hazy orange color just how I like it
"Thanks to Ataraxia, I finally get a chance to slay this one! The directions say ""drink from the can"" but, at least for the first one, I have to pour it out and get a good look at it. Pours a golden-orange color, some straw around the very edges - mostly opaque and hazy. Many people bring up the unadulterated, unfiltered look of Heady Topper, though mine doesn't have the liberal amounts of sediment that would showcase this. Rather it appears quite clean, with maybe a tiny bit of very small particles that have seemingly vanished five minutes into this one. Either way, a nice looking beer with a super foamy, just-off-white head that leaves pretty tremendous lacing atop the glass. "
You had this beer. 
"Pours a murky, pale, wheat golden color with a cottony, stubborn white head. Flecks of barley and vegetable matter float all around the beer. Juicy grapefruit with some pine on the nose. ONce the beer settles, sweeter fruit breaks through. Grapefruit up front then grass and pine emerge. But, the flavor suddenly falls of a cliff for an abrupt finish. Alcohol and unami get picked up right away and pervade throughout. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. It dries a little toward the finish. Pretty big disappointment. Pliny, Abrasive, Sucks, all way superior in my opinion."
Update
"My first go with the one, the only, Heady! Super stoked right now. Fresh 16oz can poured into a tulip (what's the big deal about all the ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"" stuff anyway?) a super hazy, almost totally opaque pastel orange with an initial 2 finger bright white head that recedes quickly to a ring that leaves moderate lacing. A little hop sediment is visible floating around. Great looking beer. "
"I've enjoyed this beer both on tap and in a can, review based on the can"
WOW---a clean crisp ipa that deserves to be on top!
"Well being an advocate for Pliny The Elder as the best beer on the planet I was reserved about the hype behind this brew. I do not really know what to say or explain the comparison. Heady Topper is a magnificent massive hop bomb that is amazingly balanced. This brew is World Class and lives up to the hype. I will now travel to Vermont to get more!!! I could drink these one after another enjoying every sip....really just an amazing beer! The bottom line is this is a World Class, top notch, killer IPA that leaves you wanting more."
"As soon as I opened the can,the fresh aroma of tropical fruits hit me in the nose. The best hop beer ive ever had. Its well balanced aroma is amazing.Just the right amount. The 8.0 abv is perfect too...If you havent tried this beer,seek it out. Its well worth it"
"So, my first review! Had it a few times, and it's surely the best beer I've had."
So lucky to have gotten a 4 pack of this...so selfish that I've only got 1 can for sharing purposes left. 
Poured into a pint glass and a nice fluffy head developed which lasted through the drink. Aroma was very hoppy with flower and citris notes. Appearance was a cloudy straw color with nice sediment chunks. Tast was super hoppy with strong flower and hop notes with grain on the back. Mouthfeel was light but with a hint of creamyness. Aftertaste was dry and bitter on the end.
"I have really been enjoying this beer. Its easily available to me and I find that I'm picking up a four pack of it at least a couple times a week. Seems to be the beer that everyone wants to trade for as well. Overall, it's become my go-to beer. Just like many others, I have tried this poured in a few different glasses but prefer it out of the can."
16oz can poured into a pint glass. HUGE thanks to kingcrowing for this MAJOR want!!! Reviewed side by side with Pliny the Elder
One of the best beers I've ever tasted. The balance and aroma is top notch. The can is inviting to just grad and take one big long sip. The taste is smooth and full of hoppy goodness. The smell once can is cracked just invites you to drink its deliciousness. My vote for beer of the year!!!
"I had this in a glass at lunch and in the can for dinner. Since the brewer recommends drinking directly from the can, that's how I'll rate it....although I will say it's coppery and cloudy in the glass. First off, the aroma is BRILLIANT. This is an awesomely hoppy-smelling beer with notes of candy and tropical fruit (maybe even peach?). The first thing I tasted was the roasty, nutty malts followed by a bitter punch in the mouth! The finish is fruity, falling somewhere between papaya and peach. What I found most surprising was the creamy, soft mouthfeel. This is to date the best beer I've ever had. It's well worth the hype and the drive to VT (since you can't get it anywhere else)."
"Very few brews make bring a shit eating grin to my face - wow this is good! Starts with a hazy belgian blond hue with a slight finger of creamy white cap that quickly dissipates leaving just a few small islands of foam. Nose brings bright juicy citrus (mandarin, grapefruit) pineapple, slight floral pine, very juice and a hoppy earthiness. This beer reminds me alot of Nelson - big tropical notes and juicy with pine dankiness play a small secondary roll. The taste brings bitter papaya, lime rind, light caramel malts and some pine needle covered forest floor - as it warms almost an herbal, minty licorice note comes out. The mouthfeel is creamy and lush but is quickly balanced by a strong hop bitterness. Best beer not sure about that but at least top 3 ipa's i have ever had and well worth trading for."
Heady Topper
A- pours a hazy amber with little head. Almost no lacing.
"16 oz can poured into a nonic, despite the urging of the can. Maybe I'll drink the next one from the can. I left about an eighth inch of beer in the can."
Big thanks to Papat444 for this one. Very excited to try it!
"Gifted from BostonRyan, much appreciated. 16 oz can , 8 oz poured into a HF glass and the rest consumed from can as per instructions. 2 weeks fresh."
Got this one in a trade. Damn good stuff.
"Tried this one first in a glass and then straight out of the can. It was definetely more aromatic drunken straight from the can, and my scores in terms of smell, taste and overall are modified with the can session."
Served in a tulip with a foamy white two finger head. Hazy straw colored body.
"Best. Beer. Ever. Well maybe but its incredible. The hops smell from the can is overwhelming. It must be drunk from the can. For all the hops smell the bitterness is smooth and just right. Drink this if you can find it. And if you find it buy me a few extra cases, I will pay ya back!"
16 oz can of deliciousness served into a tall tulip.
This is definately my favorite IPA.
"Keeping it simple, this is a fantastic beer worthy of the praise it gets. Great job Alchemist on brewing a single beer perfectly. Please don't change that focus. You can't miss with a singular objective like that! "
Second time around with this beer in the last week. 
"Best way to drink a Heady Topper, pick it up from the Alchemist Brewery on your way to Stowe for an epic day of skiing. Crack that delicious beer on the lift and enjoy, of course remembering to recycle. Ohhhh how I love Vermont. If only Hill Farmstead was on the way to Stowe."
16oz can poured into a tulip. Big thanks to Kevanb for graciously giving up his last can of this for me to try!
"Heady Topper. This is it. This beer in my hand is truly the best DIPA, and maybe the best beer period. Pouring this beer into a brand new tulip glass seems blasphemous given the clear instructions to drink form the can, but I've done that enough, and can't miss an opportunity to enjoy the full sensory experience of HT. "
"It just hit #1 on BA yesterday, and today he local shop sold out in two hours. Jmscowcroft was able to get a four-pack and set me up but when I went at lunch it was sold out. "
Heady Topper - 1 Pint - Can
"All around best IPA ever. Might be due to how fresh it was, I picked up a case and it was gone within 2 weeks."
"Yesterday this was #3, new BA format and BOOM #1, tastes even better now!"
"I snatch one of the four silver cylinders attached together by a molded plastic frame, a classy version of un animal friendly can holder that's been villified accross beaches nationwide. I put my index finger squarely on the tab, and lift it up. I reach the can up to my lips, I've entered Hop Heaven."
Amazing aroma of the can! Definitely drink out of the pour a little in a glass so you can remember what the best brew looks like : ) 
This beer is one of the best I have ever had. It is strong with a bite. The biggest flavor you will taste is a heavy amount of Grapefruit!
"A: The beer is hazy yellow in color and has some hints of amber hues. It poured with a finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin film of bubbles covering the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass. There is a slight amount of carbonation visible along with some fine particles floating in suspension."
16oz Can poured into a Duvel tulip.
"Here I thought Hillfarmstead was a winner! This beer is by far the best kind of brew prolly in the world! If you have not tried Heady Topper, you are nuts. OMG. It made me a believer of hops and the magic is provides when it comes to sleep. Heady Topper is drinkable. I'm telling you right now, it doesn't taste like 8%. So, if you are a fast drinker, a 4 pack should do ya!"
Thanks to baconsausage for sending me a four pack as extras (thanks to him for the glass and the other six or seven extras too).
A - Extremely murky. You can barely even see light through this beer. A bit of head. Really something unusual here.
Shared with RoninTK3. Served from a pint can into a Smuttynose glass.
I took the first few pulls from the can as instructed .... then I poured into a cigar city Tulip glass. I did not enjoy from the can really. I like my IPAs in a glass so I can enjoy the nose.
"Had on tap in VT and from cans. Review from both glass (tulip/large wine glass) and also from the can. Was canned around 2nd week, December 2012."
My friend was in VT skiing over Christmas and was able to get his hands on 6 four-packs. Needless to say it was an amazing New Years!
"16oz CANS, served in various goblets over christmas"
"I first poured a few OZ off to get a look then drank the rest from the can. Pours a hazy amber/straw in color with a pretty standard white head and pretty good lacing, points for the cool can as well. The smell fills the room even from the can resiny, piney, and citrus hops with tropical notes, pretty much any hop smell you can think of rolled into one. Taste of pure hop juice for me, not overly bitter but the can describes it best ""wave after wave of hop goodness"", there are also some malts in there if you try really hard to notice them. The mouthfeel is not all that heavy, the 8% abv is not noticeable at all and if you have access to this one it can be drank can after can. This can was exactly 1 week old."
Everything about this beer screams Hop bomb from the beginning
Poured from a can into a tulip.
Appearance: Poured a little into a snifter to see what it looked like. Hazy orange/gold. I like the haziness of the beer. foretold of the great things to come.
Appearance: Presents a slightly hazy honey color capped by a couple of inches of foam; swathes of lace
Probably one of the best IPA's I have ever tasted! 
HUGE want delivered to me by surprise from leschkie (thanks so much!) poured into a New Belgium Globe.
Christmas came early this year and I was finally able to get my hands on a Heady Topper in MA! My brew supply store randomly had a 4-pack and the owner was kind enough to give me one.
This is one of the best beers i have ever had. Made a trade and pulled some strings and was able to have one for myself within a week of it being canned.
L - 2-finger fluffy white head atop a translucent yellow body.
Smells so good I want to crawl in the can. Hoppy yet smooth and citrusy. Truly an experience for the DIPA style. I can see why this beer consistently ly gets high reviews. It's a shame it's so difficult to get. This seems to be only avilable in central VT and not the parts of VT that border NY. Bummer...hopefully they will get better distrbution.
"Simply my favorite beer, hands down. I love the nose on this beer; the grapefruit and other citrus notes are a pleasure. Depending on the time of year and what batch you get, the flavor varies, but it's always delicious. Heck, my only complaint is that it is difficult to acquire down here in the deep south."
"Poured one in a glass and had another out of the can. It's a pale golden color. Smells of serious oranges, grapefruit, grass, mint, pine. Sweet smelling yet means business. Big hop flavors of deep citrus with sour rind, big gulp of grass, mint, pine, grapefruit towards the finish, strong clean bitterness, booze and sweetness mingle for a vodka-feel and cheddar cheese afterthought. Heavy body with medium carbonation, prickly. Very clean and big on the palate and belly."
"Poured from the can (broke the ""rules"" on this one) into a Heady Topper stemless wine glass that I picked up from the brewery. This beer was canned 30 days ago as of this review."
Poured from a 16 oz can into an oversized wine glass. Thank you Surge1311 for hooking me up with this in a trade. 
Received in a recent trade and I'm stoked to be able to finally try this beer... 
"Have had this several times, attempting my first review of the renowned Heady Topper."
"Had the 3/4 straight from the can, then poured the rest into a snifter."
"Boy oh boy oh boy. I've been waiting a long time for this one. Heard the hype for months and finally picked one up locally in SoCal. Yeah, imagine that. I bought a can of this in L.A. at retail. 1 pint aluminum can served into a New Belgium stem-goblet in me gaff in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. 8.00% confirmed. Consumed in celebration of completing my grad school applications. I don't see canned-on date, but my local beer store guy informed me it was two weeks old when I bought it yesterday. "
"I had read a lot about this beer before i tasted it. It lived up to the hype! A bitter, flowery beast of perfection."
"I have the wonderful pleasure of living 10 minutes away from The Alchemist cannery, and was a long time patron of their restaurant/brewery before the flood. A skeptic at first, I was amazed at the first run. Not being a huge fan of anything canned, it was such an incredible surprise when I took my first sip. HOPSSS, and such an incredible punch to the mouth of amazing flavors. This is everything a beer should be, and more. Others have written much better/professional reviews. If you question any of them, shoot me a message and let's trade because this brew speaks for itself."
"Acquired a 4-pack from a trade. No date on this, but it was picked up last week from the brewery. Should only be a couple weeks old at this point."
"A. It has a lovely deep orange color. Fairly opaque, some sediment. It has a big foamy white head that leaves a good deal of lacing."
"Thanks go to my cousin Jeff for picking this up for me from the cannery. Even though it says to drink it from the can, I prefer it from the glass. The first thing you notice as you pop the top is the wonderful aroma, ton of oranges, citrus, pine and tropical fruit. It pours a deep orange, moderate white head, big chunky floaters. The flavor is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, bitter pine. IMO the hoppiest beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The body is medium, some noticeable booze, decent carbonation. Great DIPA, pretty much lives up to hype."
"As good as it gets, this beer makes you smile from ear to ear. As soon as it gets close enough to your face you know something worthwhile is about to hit the fan; shit the golden goose would be envious to produce and all the hyperbole I can write in the name of an awesome beer. From the smell to the initial taste on your lips, it's a fall in love experience that very few beers can replicate. I advise you to seek out this beer and have at it. Unfortunately, i've only had a few to the head but i've sampled it a often enough and it's always the same reaction--Good, good god, it's good. "
You had this beer. 
Have had this plenty of times in a can and in a glass.
Poured (partially) from a 16-oz. tallboy can into a tulip-shaped Relic Brewing Co. Belgian snifter.
You had this beer. 
"Well I am following the instructions and drinking this one from the can. I did previously have one poured into a glass.... which the apperance is hazy gold with hop leaves floating around and white sticky head. Sicne I'm reviewing this from the can, I will be generous with appearance since the can has a pretty cool look. The aroma is bright and citrusy with loads of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine. The aroma emanates freely from the mouth opening which gives me a nice bit of aroma (which I was expecting to be restrained from the can). The taste is delicious... the hops all come together and features a nice fruity/citrus profile. Notes of mango, apricot, and grapefruit come through with minimal bitterness. A touch of cream even comes through which really unifies the flavors. Almost no bitterness on the finish. The 8% ABV is dangerously undetectable. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonation which makes for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a delicious IPA. I recently had a less than fresh can...and I must say the fresh can really shines and pops with flavor. Well worth seeking out."
"BA share, DenverBeerDrinker (thanks man!)"
"Finally get to do a full review of this. I did pour it out of the can however. Body is cloudy and some brown/orange in the amber. Head is maybe a finger tall any only slightly off-white. Smells amazing like citra hops. There is a sweetness to it, but that blends in so well with the hops that you almost miss it. Lime and grapefruit. For flavor, it is very similar to the aroma. Nice lime and pine. A little white sugar. Mouth is great with strong carbonation and decent body. "
Can poured into tulip.
"S: Huge blast of peach, citrus, passionfruit. Unbelievably fruity and bright, faint maltiness."
"So after a few years, I wanted to give this beer the full review it deserves. "
Can from unknown production date:
First of all this is my favorite beer definitively. Its in the top 5 best things about living in Vermont for me (I still lovermont) so take this review with a grain of salt if you must 
A- Cloudy and ugly peach colored body with tons of floaters. Head is a big frothy white color that leaves a ton of lacing. It makes sense that they want you to drink this out of a can.
You had this beer. 
Appearance – Drank straight from the can. 
"A - Cloudy and overall not a deterrent but it is cloudy. It depends on your expectation for a great IPA. Pliny is clear, heady is cloudy. So what. What do you want"
"This it it! Years of tasting beers and I've found my favorite (thus far). Everything about this beer suits my palate perfectly. Arena, bitterness, yeast character are all flawless. Its unique yeast, plentiful hops, and generous bittering are perfect."
"This beer is a hazy orange with a nice fluffy head and excellent lacing. It does kind of look like there's dandruff in there, though (can says it's hop resins). "
"Went to the brewery to get this one, only to find they had sold out. Luckily a local pub had it on tap and all the travelling was well worth it. Appearance wise it is cloudy with a grainy foamy head. Not overly pretty but i know this is meant to be drunk straight out of a can, so i wont hold that against them. Hops hit the nose straight away in a big american way, citrusy, piney, tropical, but underneath it all is a reasuring earthy malt base. Tastes a lot like it smells. A bunch of wonderful things coming together in a way that isnt completely cohesive, but complimentary enough that you can enjoy everything together or pick out the various delicious elements, like a farmers market salad. Really, really like this. its got a nice oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation and finishes clean and moreish. taste well rounded, complete, refreshing a little raw, but in a surprisingly endearing way. Would drink a lot of these, but i dont live in Vermont so i can't."
Thank you so much to Jzeilinger for sending me this in return for absolutely nothing. You sir are truly awesome!
I am reviewing based on a 16oz can poured into a pint glass. I regularly drink this right from the can but made the pour for purpose of this review. I've had it on tap as well.
"Very hazy amber color, dirty juice look with a lot of particulate, with just over one finger of head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Surprising lack of lacing is left down the glass. The beer is nothing great to look at."
Pours hazy gold into a Sam glass. Bright white head with excellent retention recedes to coat surface. Tropical fruit and grapefruit aromas. Full with sweet tropical fruit upfront turning to full resin and grapefruit in the lasting finish. Truly a wonderful ale from a great up and coming brewery.
You had this beer. 
"Finally, I got my hands on this. Here we go. I'm going to drink from the can, as instructed on the can, but I will pour a bit so I can comment on the appearance. Aromas on popping the can are strong and abundant. Beautifully balanced oregano-spiced hops roll out, with a strong resiny background and malty sweet backbone. Smells amazing. I poured about a half a tumbler so I could see any head formation, and boy is there. The beer is a slightly hazed, unfiltered, goldenrod coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that is an inch and a half and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Flavors are roasted in the backbone, with a rich, resiny, bitter hops presence that just overflows the palate. The hops spicing is more subtle than the nose was, which works out very well in the total package. Citrus characters roll out across the palate the more you drink, with an undertone of grapefruit tart and bitterness. Delicious. Wet hops flavors are abundant from the initial taste across the board into the aftertaste. Rich, full bodied, and extremely smooth, which supports all of the flavor profiles. The finish is bitter and slightly drying, with a clean overall feel. This beer is fantastic. The more you drink, the more layers of hops flavor reveal themselves. Amazing. This is a tremendous brew!"
On tap in a snifter at the cannery in Vermont.
Oh man was I glad to score one of these! I poured a little into a glass to see what it looked like; nothing special but you're supposed to drink it out of the can so..not applicable?
"16 ounce pint can thanks to youbrewidrink, appreciate it man! Pour is bright orange with a lot of haze, some floaties, and a lot of lacing. Smell is fruity hops, some pine, smells good. Flavor is bitter, tropical fruits, definitely a good DIPA. If I didn't know better I'd guess this was a west coast IPA. I can see why this is so highly rated and I'd love to get a four pack but I know it isn't easy."
"Looks like dirty sewer water dumped into a light beer, smaller off white head. Aroma is tropical fruit, marijuana, onions. Similar flavor, lots of onions, garlic, tomato, juicy fruit, papaya, and orange. Bitter finish, pretty dry for the ABV. Reminds me exactly of what Toppling Goliath is doing around here."
Alchemist Heady Topper is a delicious DIPA. It has the delicious aroma and flavour of hops without being particularly bitter. How did they do that? I want to know so I can homebrew some.
"On a Trip to Vermont with the Family... I had to stop here. I got my first taste of this beer on Tap and it was amazing. Of course they were out of cans, luckily on my way out of town they were restocked and I picked up some (definitely not enough)."
A fresh specimen canned on Monday October 8. We quickly developed an intimate rapport with this beer.
A - I followed directions and drank it straight out of the the can. Cool can.
Special thanks to Andrew84 for this one 
"I tried this from the can and poured. As the can advises, the taste is better from the can. Poured it is hazy orange, very little head and minimal lacing."
"A - Pours a very hazy orange/yellow with nice 2 finger white head. I love the haziness here, almost pumpkin colored in tint."
"Been trying to track this one down for a long while, finally scored a solo can. Enjoying from the Can as the can instructs you to. This is my first review."
I followed the directions and drank it straight from the can- each time you take a sip the hops (citra?) really hits you! 
"I've had this beer many, many times..On tap at the PIG is the best place to drink it. Also, had it straight up out of the can. And, even went against the grain and poured the can into a glass pint. This beer is so god i would recommend taking a bath in it. Tons of hop after hop his your noise from the get go. Beautiful gold color, with a creamy head that laces perfectly to the glass and your face! Mild bitter, Erich is explained on the can. 8% abv so clearly, this one can get ahead of you. Very balanced malt to bittering, creating a nice full creamy body. I live about 3hrs away from the Alchemist cannery, and do travel up there often, if, you're looking to trade, drop me you're request."
Picked up quite a few 4 packs from the Hunger Mountain Co-op on my way to the HF Harvest Festival
Saved my first review for my favorite beer I've ever had. Thank you grandparents for residing in Vermont and giving me an excuse to load up on Heady once a year.
A big shout out to Verecund for this one! Very awesome of you man!
"5/13/2013 - Snifter. I was told this was ""4 days old"" from the kind bearded man who apparently had a trunk full of this bounty."
"Can thanks to juliusseizure. Enjoyed from the can, because my mother taught me to follow directions."
"What a fun can of beer! It is great that we can zip up to Vermont and bring a couple of cases home for sharing over the summer. Of course, the warning ""drink from the can"" does make a difference. I did pour some in a snifter, but you lose some of the smell and the creaminess."
A: Pours a hazy dark straw yellow in color with some hints of golden yellow and very light amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a finger tall dense and creamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a mottled thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
"Reasonably fresh can, as fresh as I can get them in Europe. Thank you PaulMcConnell, been dying to try this hype monster since I first heard of it. Canned September 5th, had September 23rd. Poured a small amount into a glass for the appearance."
"I get this from time to time, it was the best beer i ever had about three years ago. But lately, something has changed not worth the 3 hour drive each way anymore, not to mention the bullshit of store hopping if you want more than a 4pk."
Poured from a can to a nonic pint
A-I drink from the can but have poured into a glass and it is an amber with tons of sediment. 
"Appearance: Heady Topper pours a hazy pale orange color and is topped with ¾” of head that tends to linger nicely, while Belgian lacing lines the glass. "
"Although the can directs not pour I couldn't do that. After taking a sip or two from the can I poured out and got the full hop aroma which I have to have with an IPA. This is beer is talked up so much I feared I would be let down but even with lofty expectations this beer exceeded them. Best IPA in northeast, Hands down."
"Appearance: His mama name him 'Clay', I'ma call him 'Clay' - straight from the can as advised by the maker. Who am I to defy him?"
Had my first Heady Topper from the can..this ones from a tulip. Pours a very hazy pale orange with 2 fingers of head. Great retention and lacing. Some bubbles rising in the glass.
"Cracked open a can over the weekend...had it before but just getting around to reviewing it. The can I received from a friend is a couple weeks ""old"" but apparently at prime drinking age. "
"Finally getting around to reviewing this one after drinking it several times and learning that I really love it. Poured at fridge temp into an opaque ceramic mug. Peering down in there, it looks like a good murky orange color, and I vaguely recall that it looks good in a glass."
Pick up as much as you can when visiting the Brewery in Vermont! 
Thanks to a great friend Tut2528 for giving me my first HT! Really appreciate it my man!
"Last of a four can haul. Pours peach-juice amber. Big white head with slippery spots of lacings on the glass (yeah, I ignored the can instructions). "
"Drank out of the can. This is about as close to DIPA perfection as you can get. I absolutely cannot believe that beer from a can could be this good. Total fresh hop fragrance hits you as you pop the top of the can. The can says ""drink from the can"" but I need to pour it into a glass to appreciate the hop aroma and flavor to its fullest. really nice unfiltered murky pour with a huge off-white creamy head. The flavor is perfection: huge hop flavor with none of the bitterness. My favorite beer right now."
"Whenever I make my way to Hill Farmstead, I always make sure to drop by and pick up a few Heady's, which says something because it is one of a few IPAs that can stand up to the HF IPAs. "
"A- Pours a honey gold, with a great head, slighly cloudy with sediment which is why it's 4.5 and not a 5. The floaties in there are a great part of this beer however. The Hop oils are apparent."
"murky orange pour - had 2 cans, drinking this one from a glass because i can.. fuck you :) ... half inch of off-white head, thick lacing."
Can shared by Mike. Thanks! Pours dark golden with off white head. Aroma is sick. And by that I mean awesome. Wet resiny sticky hops dominate the nose. Flavor follows the nose and has a great meaty malt backbone to back it up. Medium mouthfeel. This tastes amazing. Its worthy of all the praise it gets. Just awesome.
"Pours very cloudy light orange with a huge 2 finger foamy snow white head that was full of bubbles and faded slowly, leaving very good foamy lacing. "
WOW! This is an exceptionally well hopped pale ale. I wish I could get it all the time. It is cloudy orange with a finger of head. Highly carbonated with a full complement of hop aromatics. Lower bitterness than I was expecting from a imperial IPA. WOW!
Had two glasses of this on my birthday. If this even wasn't in the afternoon and I didn't have to drive myself home I'd have had quite a few more.
Thanks ZGunder you made my week with these heady toppers!
"Big thanks goes out to YaKnowBrady for sending me a few cans of this for the sole reason that I had never ticked it before! Thanks immensely my friend! Served from can into an oversized wine glass. Poured red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, fruit, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, earth, and fruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I am so excited I was finally able to try this one now that they can it. Wow! What a beer it was… It had some aspects that reminded me of Gubna, but had a huge amount of balance going on to keep your palate nice and happy so it did not succumb to a palate hop onslaught. Very well balanced and inviting after each sip. You know what… Notre Dame is playing Navy right now as I’m typing this up on my laptop, I think I will have another one of these right now straight from the can! Cheers!"
"Can shared on the bus during RBSG 2012. Pours clear gold with a sudsy white head. Huge tropical and citrus aroma, grapefruit, peach, orange peel, pineapple. Nice blend of resin, pine and acidic citrus notes in the flavor. Dry bitter finish. Great DIPA, promoting big hoppy flavors instead of malt and booze."
"a: Pale gold to deep gold in color, with a significant, long lasting head. A small amount of carbonation and a bit of lacing."
"A - Pours wonderfully in my goblet style glass. Nice, 2 finger white head. Amber golden in color & very cloudy. "
Poured into my Great Lakes snifter (against the advice of the can cuz I'm a badass)
"My deepest thanks go out to Urbancaver. Because of his thoughtfulness and good nature, I was given the rare opportunity to try this beer. I'm told it's about 5 days old at the time of this review."
"A - Pours a hazy orange, sunset with snowflake particles swimming around. A big 3"" froth comes after the pour and stays around like your annoying uncle on the holidays. "
"an affordable can at farmhouse tap in burlington. they say drink it from the can, but i poured it for more careful study. it looks lovely, hazy, definitely unfiltered. radiant hay color with thick white suds floating on top that leave some mean lacing as it drinks. smells like quite the hop bouquet. grapefruit and spruce are the most prominent hop esters im picking up, but there are many. it tastes like it smells, deep and complex, worthy of patient consumption. its fruity, in addition to citrus there is also nectarine and mandarin orange on my tongue. its got upbeat carbonation which keeps its oily medium taffy sticky body moving along. the aftertaste is long and bittersweet, as it should be. alcohol is well hidden in taste, but can certainly be felt. this is one hell of a big ipa, and i dont want to hear anymore debate about pliny/heady, because both are outstanding and distinct brews, and that should suffice for all of us."
16 0z can was poured into a tulip glass. I have had it out of the can plenty of times and respect the brewery to drink it out of the can except for this one time.
Tasted and smelled from the can as per the directions. Poured for a appearance afterwards.
Big Thanks to MarkF150. Believe this was canned 8/9
In my top 3 all time favorite beers. FIghts for the number 1 spot But I think it might be one of the ebst beers
"I was able to buy a couple 4-packs of this cult legend during a recent trip to Stowe, Vermont. No buyer's remorse at all! I enjoyed Heady straight from the can–as recommended by the brewery right on the can–but I did have a single serving decanted into a wine glass (I do prefer drinking it straight from the can). "
"Yes I have enjoyed it straight from the can, but today I am reviewing in a glass."
My buddy went up to Vermont this past month and was lucky enough to pick up a 6pack for himself and gave me one!
You had this beer. 
"Thanks to Rob for acquiring this one. Really cool can, by the way, although I didn't heed the advice to drink from it."
A - An awesome can - Drink from it.
"A - An orange, almost amber color. Quite cloudy. Limited carbonation. "
"Between the Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Lawson's Finest, I feel very lucky to live in VT! IPAs are my favorite style of beer, but I usually find DIPAs to be too strongly tasting of alcohol. This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable despite its high alcohol content and potent hopping. The smell of the heady topper alone is delicious, and the taste is even better, with passionfruit, mango, and piney hop aromas. The heady topper delivers the ultimate hops experience!"
Poured from a 16oz can into a Sam Adams nucleation glass. Thanks DonFrap for including it in the last trade.
Drank from my Gulden Draak tulip.
"Two cans, one poured, the other straight up. Poured has a nice white head, no lacing. The smell is piney and flowery. The taste is totally raw and bitter, sweet upfront and that's the end, except for a chalky dry aftertaste. It's greasy with a good amount of fizz. Why is a beer like this necessary?"
thank you.
scored a couple 4-packs and smuggled them back to PA. pint can into flying dog tulip. no canned on date. 
"This is incredible stuff, this beer was drank mostly from the can... only poured a sample of it out to enjoy the orange yellow color of it with a nice looking white head on top. Had a nice unfiltered cloudiness to it also. The smell of the beer is very hoppy, lots of pine aromas in it with the delicate floral and citrusy notes in there as well. The taste is probably worthy of a 5.5 honestly. There is no doubt that this has some of the best transitions of flavors I've had from any IPA. There is a huge rush of floral sweet citrus notes on the tongue in the very beginning, as the liquid settles there is a very subtle burst of malts on the tongue right before the aggressive pine resin starts to claw away at your taste buds. The mouthfeel is smoothly carbonated making this beer very easy to drink, it's medium bodied and has a nice dry finish to it. Overall this is something very special, The people up at Alchemist aren't screwing around here, they are setting out to make the best IPA in the world and I would say that they just might have it. This is a beer I would drive to Vermont to get cases of. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to drinking the next 3 in the pack."
Thanks to a great friend for sharing with me.
A: golden straw colored with a light eggshell colored head
"I got no bad words about it. But this is theee best beer that I ever drink in my holler life of travelling the world. And I have to say that the alchemist brewery did an exceptional job on this unique beer. For those that can handle the heady topper, maybe you should try the walden. That is a brew made by the alchemist and hill farm brewery together. Very similar to heady topper but much lite. I wish the alchemist made more then 1800 cans of week so that other stores closer to my house would be able to have them."
"Sorry, I had to pour into the glass despite the can's pleading to drink directly. Thick, slowly receding head. Leaves plenty of chunky, blanketing lace. Cloudy, dark gold color."
"As instructed, I drank this AMAZING beer directly from the can as well as from a tulip glass. Hands-down, no-doubt one of my Top 3 IPAs of all-time..."
"Yesterday, HT was a beer I hoped to try some day. Today, after a tasting, HT is the best beer I've ever had. Thanks to Brandon for sharing a 4-pack, of which I greedily and surreptitiously consumed more than my fair share. "
What a beer!!!
"Reviewed as drank from the can, as it is made abundantly clear that this is the way to drink it. "
Had on Tap at the Blind Tiger some months back... from notes
"This beer was kind of hard to review. The can is stamped all over with ""Drink from can"" so that is how I had it. Very hard to rate appearance with a beer in a can. So, I'll give it a 4.0, assuming from the rest of the characteristics that it would look good in a glass."
"App: well, it says right on the can to drink it from the can! So I did. But for review sake, I poured half of it in a glass to look at it. Appears pale yellow, light orange, cloudy, low carbonation, slight lacing, the way I envision an IPA, like it should be, not deep orange."
"My first review of a beer I choose this one, kindly sent fresh from the northeast. I preface, this offering is being tasted on an afternoon where, sometime following this review i will be trying my first Pliny TE (having arrived simultaneously).. Heady Topper: As a lover of American craft brew for 3 years and having tried, in my mind, a good deal of DIPA's (considering I didn't become a craft beer advocate until relocating to Texas oddly enough), I am more than enthusiastic about this tasting.The hop bouquet is blowing my mind, and in a well-balanced way. Expectations of this beer are met and slightly exceeded (they were phenomenal expectations prior to sampling). Pineapple/ citrusy greatness abounds. With this beer it seems as if I've never appreciated the mouthfeel of this style until now. There is no drawback here. Tasty beyond belief. Balance is impeccable, yet i need to stress how the hops flourish here... is this Simcoe and Citra? Well i dont know, that I wonder though. Anyway out of curiosity I poured a bit less than 1/4 of the can into a Chimay chalice for a visual. I really appreciate an unfiltered IPA made well (prior to this my affinity was for the now-shelved DFH Squall). Im liking the look of murky golden when I know everything else about it is sublime. The lacing with Heady is incredible, and again lacing is something I continue to appreciate but with this beer in a glass it was sticky city (and this from a beerman who spot cleans his glassware well). But yes I have to agree with the brewmastery of Alchemist where the recommendation is to drink from the can. Yes you will surely love it in glassware, but if you love true hop heaven, you will be best to press lips to aluminum."
Thanks cam!!!!
You had this beer. 
"I had heard alot about Alchemist in the beer world and had yet to try any of their beers. The other day I was in Waterburry and decided to find their brewery. Apparently the brew pub was flooded badly during hurricane Irene along with the rest of Waterburry. Luckilly their new 15 barrel canning brewery was not damaged and now produces Heady topper exclusively. I went into their store and they were selling Heady Topper for $12 a 4-pack as well as a Glutein-free saison, but I was only interested in the Heady Topper, which is fairly hard to get a hold of unless you are in the Waterburry/Burlington area of Vermont. I live in north eastern Vermont and I hadn't seen it around, but have heard it can cost alot more than $3 a can in some gas stations. "
Had on Tap at the Blind Tiger some months back... from notes
"Big thanks to Celtic001 for a couple of these sent my way. I was so excited for the arrival of these, that once they were chilled to perfection, they disappeared quickly. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a murky dark orange/gold with a thick lustrous off-white head on top. "
Let me tell you about the mythical adventure that this beer bestowed upon me....
A friend of mine gave this beer to me as a belated birthday present and I was a bit surprised that it came in the form of a can but don't let the can intimidate you.
"Pours from a 16 oz can, nice hazy orange color. Smell is of sweet hops. Taste is medium bodied, great balance to it. Not overly hoppy (as warned by the outside of the can) and has a great maltiness to it that most IPAs (specifically double IPAs) are missing. Delicious aftertaste.. I can see why this has such a high rating. Felt lucky to try this beer, definitely worth seeking out if you get a chance.. one of the better imperial IPAs I've gotten to try."
"What more can I say about this beer? Drove 7 hrs from PA to the brewery. People were very nice there. Bought 3 cases, only trouble is you have to keep it cold because it is unpasturized I believe."
"I got this beer from a fellow advocate beerMeFitz, thanks man! Following the advice of a friend, I poured some in my Half Acre Tulip and drank the rest in the can. The pour was a hazy beautiful orange color with very little head that disappeared rather quickly. I Swirled it around in the glass a little and noticed that the lacing was not as much as I expected."
"The verbiage on the can states that you should drink this right out of the can. Sacrilege to most beer geeks, but the request comes from the brewers and I understand why. I tasted this out of a snifter since it was being shared with a really good beer guy I met at the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell. He brought a few cans in with him and he was sharing, so I was gratefully drinking. "
"Despite the ""directions"" I've been conditioned to only drink BMC out of the can. Dark orange-yellow in color, looks like dirty orange juice, and murky. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a sturdy white cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass.. Pungent citrus pineapple aroma with solid sweet, sticky malt and orange beneath and just the slightest hint of booze. The aroma almost has a feel to it. Like hop resin and dust in the sinuses. Amazing. Thick and chewy feel with dense, rich carbonation that lazily rolls through. Pungent citrus hop flavor from start to finish that are propped up by a strong sweet malty backbone.. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness with a touch of citrus bitterness and booze."
"I just opened my first ever Heady Topper. In the words of the great Homer Simpson ""Jebus, Buddha, I love you alll."" This is different than anything I have had before. Nothing relates to it. I have had Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, and a number of other amazing beers. I am not sure I am saying its the best beer I have ever had, but its in the discussion and its definitely unique. I am drinking it straight from the can as the rim of the can says to do. Its extremely bitter to in the begining but citrus in the end. Do whatever it takes to get your hands on this (outside of taking one of my glorious new friends from my fridge)."
"No question the best IPA I've had. Can not review appearance, you should only drink from the can, as designed. (But gave it a 5 because I'm sure it's perfect, website makes you enter value here) Desperate to find more, may have to take a trek... Grab this if you can, beats them all."
"Fresh can given to me by Beermefitz, a complete stranger until today. Thank you so much for the generous gesture. Good beer karma shines down on you this day."
A: Perfect... clear golden with a thick lasting white head.
Pint-sized can served cold.
This is the shiznit. Been drinking and home brewing for years. DIPA's are my thing and this is amazing. Best beer on the east coast IMHO and probably the best beer I've had. I lived on the west coast 15 years ago but haven't had the west coast stuff fresh in years but this stuff is amazing. $4 for a can is a steal. Planning another trip to VT just to stock up. I ruined myself.
"Following the rules is really difficult for me but when the can tells you to drink it straight from the can, I listen. Hey, who am I to go against the way this beer was meant to be drank. I have heard from others though that this beer isn't very pretty. I can imagine that's true since this thing is truly hop heaven. "
"500ml can 8,0% ABV. "
Bought a 4-pack from the Beverage Warehouse while in Winooski last weekend.
"A - I know it says to drink from the can but I wanted to see it. It's a hazy, orange with hints of lemon near the edges. Light carbonation near the bottom. Had a few inches of white head that slowly disappeared "
"I did not go into this with too big of expectations. Most of the highly rated IPAs I've had have not lived up to my expecations and I was disappointed. Maybe going into it with open expectations is the way to go, because this floored me. I am so sad it is gone. "
16oz can divided between a snifter and the can.
"Served in a nonical pint glass just for appearance. Drank 1st from the can, the way it is meant to be drank."
A - pours a slightly hazey marigold color. A fingers worth of froathy white head which quickly dissipates to just a white ring around the rim. No lacing. 
thanks to egrace84 for sending this can my way! Thanks elliot!
"The Crack! seemed extra loud in the silence of my kitchen following yesterday's snowfall. My gentle Glug still produced a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that turned to wisps pretty quickly. Color was a hazy Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose had a grapefruit tartness underlain by a tropical fruitiness. Mouthfeel was medium. The intensity of the hops immediately began an assault on my tongue, eroding all of those weak or dead taste buds and leaving the defenses wide open for the second wave. Now, it was like hydrofluoric acid, worming its way into every pore and burning like hell. Finish was super hoppy, very dry."
"1pt Can. A drop into a ½ glass –just for appearance & smelling- the rest direct from the can following brewer´s suggestion. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pale straw color, hazy. Off-white, small bubbled, froth. Slowly dissipated crown leaves a thin foam layer on top. Intense ripe tropical fruit, resin & sweet malt aromas. Pleasant sweet, creamy, maltiness at fist sip mixed with tropical fruits & increasing bitterness. Medium to full body, oily texture. Low carbonation. Ripe fruit in the middle cut by resiny touch lingers into the short, dry finish. Delightful. Probably one of the best AIPA I´ve ever had."
I was at one of my favorite beer stores when I heard that they had a case of Heady Topper in the back. I decided to pick two up to see what all the buzz was about. Brought these devils home and put them on ice for a rainy day. 8 hours later I decided it was close enough. 
"This, indeed, lives up to expectations. Grabbed 24 cans in VT while boating on champlain lake. Also got some torpedo, founder's centennial and ruination IPA from stone, but HT is way more interesting. First one was pretty good. The 2 lasts were just delicious."
Wow! I received a four pack as a gift this weekend. Had heard about the beer before but put it in the fridge and continued the night. Had two last night and one tonight. What an amazing beer. Every aspect of this beer- down to the clear instructions to drink it straight from the can (cant truly rate the appearance because I drank em from the can)- make it a very special beer. After having three and checking the reviews I was not surprised to see that it is so highly rated.
Thanks to my buddy for bringing two cans of Heady Topper to our college reunion. 
"I drank the first sips from the can. Wowza! That's some insane hoppiness. As a force of habit, I had to pour 3/4 into a pint glass. The pour revealed a hazy golden blonde liquid topped with a big bubbled, chunky head. A few chunks of lace cling to the glass and the head recedes a bit but never disappears. A dusting of coarse sediment lays at the bottom. I'd suggest putting this beer in a glass if only because it looks so nice. "
"Oh, how I tried not to love this beer..."
Nice loose and tall head over a straw colored body.
"purchased on ebay, and after arriving i quickly purchased again! "
"A=4: Hazy gold with plenty of yeast floaties, nice white head with plenty of retention, some lacing."
"Pounded my first HT on my break at work today in fifteen minutes since it was consume on premises only so this review might be a little muddled, but hey, at least I got some Head."
"There's quite a lot of hype surrounding this beer, and it is my favorite style, so I was very excited to finally be able to pick some up while in Vermont recently. I drank my first one last night from the can like it says, but this time I'm pouring a whole can into a 16 oz Sam Adams ""Perfect Pint"" glass for the review (and yes I will drink the remaining two from the can!)"
Purchased a can from the Warren Store 
Drank straight from the can as instructed.
Thanks to Mielbeer for these 4 cans!
The word delicious sums up this beer quite well!
"16oz can, with no canning date, $17.99/4-pack at Andover liquors."
Big thanks to merc7186 for picking up a few cans of this for me...
Served from can.
16 oz can. Drank straight from the can. no freshness dating. thanks to markasparov for this one. 
"A: Apricot hue with a thin head and a good amount of lacing; some sediment floating around, which is why I suppose they want you to drink it from the can--sorry, guys, I just can't do it"
Thanks Hoppypocket for the opportunity to try this bad-boy!
Poured from the can into Harpoon Limited Edition snifter.
"This is my second time having this super hyped up beer. Both times I really enjoyed it. This time I am reviewing and only poured 5 ounces out of can to see appearance and get more smell than outta can...not that you can't smell the hops as soon as you crack the can. Really hazy yellowish with minimal head. Laces but not as sticky as I was anticipating, dissipates as the head did. This beer you can smell as your drinking it, rinds, grapefruit,citrus, and don't forget the hops. Different than any dipa that I ever had. Great hop pop, Med Carb,and balance that makes you want more!! Big hop aftertaste that keeps you wanting more. Overall lives up to hype and will seek out again. Hop heads dream and really really leaves hops for days in your mouth. In my top 5 just unsure until I have access to more where it falls."
My girlfriend's brother brought us a 4 pack straight from the source. I gave it all 5s for a reason.
I decided to go for this long awaited treat from The Alchemist for my 200th review.
"Light in color sort of a amber straw, nice white head and good aroma, not as much aroma as I would have expected, but good citrus and flower comes through. Also drank out of the can as suggested. The taste is nice and smooth, great drinkability. Maybe not as well balanced as others, the bitterness seems to linger with this one and I think it tends to take over the thin malt base. Great beer overall, but needs a bit better balance."
I've had this beer in a pint glass from the can and directly out of the can (as the label suggests). Liked it better in the glass. It is by far one of the finest beers I've ever had. Excellent pour brilliant finish. Place it up there with Pliney the Elder.
Thanks to Joe for breaking this out and sharing.
"My first can of Heady Topper. A clean snifter glass ready-to-go, but I promise I’ll take that first sip from the can."
"Many thanks to woodychandler for coming through big time with this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is alive with hops and citrus. Taste is also very good, hoppy, citrus and tropical fruits abound, bitter but not overly so, a well constructed beer. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall was a pleasure to drink, worth seeking out."
A - Wow they were right about one thing if you pour the can it's full of tons of hop floaties. Color is a hazy amber brown with a 1/2 inch of thick bubbly head. 
"16oz can into Duvel tulip (drank small amount from the can--prefer it in the glass, *as with every beer*). No freshness info, but my friend just bought it for me when a stray case hit Boston a couple days ago. Sold out in a day at 1 can per customer."
Amazing. by far my fav ipa. Drank a Pliny the elder and heady topper side by side and hands down heady topper came out on top just amazing. Once you crack the can you get an abundance of fresh grapefruit. Usally I drink straight from the can as it indicates to do. But not bad in a snifter as well. So well balanced. All I can think of when drinking this ipa is a super fresh grapefruit coated with a tad of granulated sugar. Hands down perfection.
A - Hazy pale orange with all sorts of floaties in it but who cares? 
"Thanks merc for sharing this, super stoked to try this."
"Pours a golden with nice haze. Head is minimal, even for the style. A pinch of lacing"
After having this beer many times I figured it's finally time to review it.
"Drank a few swigs from the can then poured into a snifter (I know, a sin). Can't verify freshness."
"Courtesy of the Black Sheep Ale House in Mineola, NY."
"A: dirty orange/cloudy, finger white head, "
"This is the one and only. No clue how old, but definitely my most anticipated beer I got from phyl21ca in CanBIF 2012. Took a sniff and a mouthful from the can as directed, then poured into a tulip. "
"had this beer many times both from the can and poured out into a glass. I really hope I can get the chance to try this brew on tap (if they do that). I have to be honest, I love the smell you get when you pour the beer into a glass and the color is spectacular, however I like the taste better straight out of the can. I wish their was a happy medium that could be found. So poured out of the can it is a golden copper color with a nice cream colored head. The smell is floral hops and very inviting. The taste is very crisp and hoppy but not overpowering. I love how balanced this IPA is."
Thanks to ActonBrewer for this one. Reviewed from notes. Drank from the can (as instructed).
"Poured from a 16oz can into an oversized, high stemmed, red wine/goblet glass."
Paid almost $13 for a single can of this beer. Worth it? We shall see.
"This is really an amazing beer. I am generally not into double IPA because they usually substitute taste for strength of content. However, I bought a 4 pack of this from Waterbury VT, and I loved it more each time I had it. The hops are incredible, the flavor is ... well try it. Its worth the three bucks that it costs."
"Poured from the can. An unfiltered cloudy orange/yellowish/bronze color with a light bubbly white head, and yeast particles abound. This beer is not the prettiest thing to look at."
"Its the real deal. Hoppy, Cirtusy, delicious. Smoothest finishing IPA / DIPA ever. No idea that it packs any extra booze than a smooth IPA. Wish I had more."
"Can at Deccico's in Brewster - and several since. Poured into tulip. Pours a hazy sticky orange. Smells fantastic. Fruity intense hop aroma! Pineapple and pine. Taste is very hop forward with a bit of fruity sweetness, pineapple, pine bitter, and some nice malt balance. A nice bitter but smooth mouthfeel..."
"16 oz can, no date, drank most of it out of the can, poured the rest into a snifter. Big thanks to Agold for sharing this with me."
Wow! Now I know why this beer has a 100 rating! Popped open my first Heady Topper tonite (am drinking it right now) thanks to a great trade bonus from rudzud (thanks again!) Notes follow:
"Heady topper is ridiculously cloudy with a nice head they yields a bit of lacing. There is some beer dandruff floating around as well. Aroma is very fruity and citrus pine explosion. There's a huge pungent aroma, this beer doesn't fuck around. Flavor is Lindy and citrusey. Very nice but not quite as pungent as the aroma and a bit sweeter. The sweetness however does not increase the mouthfeel at all. Light and dry. Very frighteningly drinkable. Definitely happy to have traded for this."
look N/A i'm fallowing instructions and not pouring any into a glass
"Poured from a can (despite the admonishments on the rim) into a Duvel tulip. Courtesy of and split with BA infi, along with BA NYManc."
Cumulative review after about 5 in the past 2 weeks...
"A: I guess this is the only ""knock"" (what a joke) on this beer. Cloudy with sediment and a lght burnt orange color. It doesn't look that pretty, but I don't want wall art, I want great beer. "
"A: I know they tell you to drink it out of the can, but that won't get me very far in this section. Pours a dark straw color with a huge white head. Cloudy with some sediment floating around. The price of great flavor."
"Yet another brew I had, but for some reason didn't rate it right after I had it. Pours a hazy amber color with a big white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit hops. Medium body with average carbonation. Excellent citrus hop flavor with a nice malt balance and a nice bitter hop finish. Taste is similar to some west coast DIPAs. Which is not a bad thing! This is Delicious."
Served from 16oz can.
"Thanks to my wife for picking these up for me when she was in VT this past weekend. Drinkin' from the can as is customary. Did pour a little to take a peek, hazy golden in color, dense head which fades away quickly. Pretty dank smell, resinous, pine, and some citrus, it does pop pretty hard. The taste is as expected, hop forward. Snappy, pine, citrus, chewy hops. Then some more hops. Not so bitter, actually much more of a fruity hop affair. This is a little refined for me, I tend to like my IIPAs rough and tough. Leaves the palate dry and crisp finish. Smooth as silk mouthfeel with soft carbonation. No trace of alcohol, drinks as easy as advertised."
"Appearance: The beer pours a yellowed brown, like cloudy dehydrated piss. With a thick bubbly eggshell white head with good retention. Lacing is light and droopy, only lasting for a short while above the head. "
"16 oz can generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a very cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The aroma is big mango, floral notes, light caramel, a bit of pineapple, and some sugar cookie. The initial taste is sweet with mango and pineapple going into a bit of caramel, sugar cookie, and some light dankness. There is a very light bitterness on finish along with some lingering mango. Light bodied. Low carbonation. I definitely could use a bit more bitterness and a bit less sweetness. Not bad, but certainly not in the class of the best west coast IPAs."
"A-	As many before me have noted, it screams “DRINK FROM THE CAN!” so the dude abides. I poured a little into a shot glass to get an idea of it though. It’s much lighter in color than I anticipated, close to something like a golden straw color with a small head. The body is cloudy and there are delicious little bits of hops floating about. Don’t read too much into the appearance though. This was by no means a full pour, and I was more curious about the color more than anything else. "
"A: Straw on edges to orangish gold. Super hazy, not sure if it's from hop haze or unfiltered. Small white head that fades quickly. Some lacing around the edges."
"Poured only a little bit in to a snifter so i could see the color, the rest will be enjoyed from the can!"
S- of heady grapefruit and citrus.
Got a couple of these from valdieu! Poured from a 16oz can into a Spiegelau tulip.
"A-golden amber color with a nice white head and good lacing, hazy with white flaky sediment"
A-Poured half into a tulip glass to see the color and drank the other half from the can as instructed by the can itself. The color is a beautiful bright orange/dark yellow. Floating sediments...looks like champagne.
Trade from JMRSN. Thanks!
"16 oz can. I poured half into a pint glass and drank the other half from the can ala the instructions. Not sure when this was canned, but it comes from the late March release to a few Massachusetts beer shops. "
Poured from can into snifter glasses.
A: Copper color. Large fluffy white head. Sediment floating.
"I have had this beer out of the can and out of several glasses and it is always good! I would have to say though, I enjoy it more of it a glass. "
16oz can into a tulip
16oz can with sample poured into goblet. From the brewery.
Poured a sample in a glass and drank the rest out of the can
Thanks you Kyle for this... man I need more of this for the summer!
"Two 16 oz cans (one direct from can, one poured into a glass) courtesy of Kadonny, and poured into my petite Duvel tulip."
"Several cans, from the can. Aroma is a burst of juicy fruity hops; pinneaples, mangos and oranges. Some wet grass and resinous hops which tends to fade as the beer gets older. Taste: I’d say it is the best tasting double IPA I’ve ever had. Flavors are very coherent with the aroma. Definitly hops at its best. The perfect level of bitterness with a sharp citrus touch. Balance and drinkability is through the roof and alcohol is very well hidden. The ultimate beach beverage"
I can't believe I forgot to review this beer! I grabbed a case when I was in Vermont. Poured into my alchemist pint glass
Welcome to Massachusetts The Alchemist Heady Topper!
Enjoyed from a can with a small glass pour to get a sense of its appearance.
Poured from the 16 oz can into a schooner-style glass. Can't come up with one single advantage of drinking from the can...plus I can't review the appearance that way (did take a sip or two from the can in between refilling my glass and it didn't affect the taste at all). No date found anywhere. 
"It's as good as advertised. Period. If you're lucky enough to find a can, don't pass it up. I could go on and on about the nose, head, color, mouthfeel and finish but everyone else has already said it. In my book, this is the king. It ruined me for other IPAs and until I can find more I'm drinking Sculpin and Deviant Dales."
Got in the Master's LIF from Number45forever. Thanks for the awesome beer. Been drinking for the last few days. This is the first review.
Not my first go-round with this great beer but my first review of it.
Thanks to baconsausage for tossing a couple of these in as extras in a trade.
A - Hazy yellow/orange. 2-3 fingers of fluffy white head.
"Heady Topper is simply the best Imperial IPA I have ever tasted. Pours out of the can with an aroma of citrus and hops. The unfiltered appearance of this beer works so well with the aroma and adds quite a bit to the experience. The taste is a complex mix of heavy citrus and light hoppy flavor. Very well balanced with a crisp, enjoyable finish. A world class beer out of a can."
A: Drank from the can as was suggested by the can.
Half a pint poured into tulip. Sampled the rest from the can.
Can poured into a 12oz pils glass at the Hulmeville Inn 4/24/2012
"A: Poured into an Alchemist Willy glass (Sorry Alechemist, I won't have it from the can again). It pours a cloudy orange with a finger white head. I tried to hold back on the yeast with a gentle pour. "
"Cloudy golden yellow with a short pale white head. Pale malts, light citrus, fresh and dry hops, lighter fruits grapefruit, pineapple and even tones of peach on the aroma. Fruity and floral from the nose. Rich, smooth fruity and nectar-like hop flavor on the first sip. Rolls into a more floral body with big hits of hops, grapefruit, peaches and dry bitterness. Dry, hoppy, sour finish. Heavily carbonated with a medium body. Intensely impressed with this, easily the best brew I could ever dream of having out of a can."
Poured from can into a snifter
"Drank from the can, as instructed! (poured a little into a pint glass to get an accurate review. (reviewed from notes) Thanks to TimmyJ21 for this can!"
"Followed instructions and drank from the can, a first for me with an IPA. As a result, I can't judge the appearance, so I gave it an average. Smell was fantastci, grapefruit and pine and grass; hops galore. Taste was intensely citrus and hops, but no super bitter like most DIPA's. Much of tre hoppiness is on the mouth and tongue, but doesn't so much linger down your throat. The grapefruit, orange, grass, pine flavors are huge and awesome. What a great combination of ingredients!"
"I drank most of this from the can, but also poured enough of it out to see what it looked like and to see what it's like in the glass. Honestly not sure which I like better. It does seem like the aroma is almost too potent in the glass, making the can a nice step back. "
"Heady Topper pours a very cloudy honey color, hints of orange and soft brown, lots of sediment floating around the glass, much of it sinks to the bottom, a faint head pops up but doesn’t stick around too long, not much of a residual film and some mild soapy lacing sticks to the glass. The aroma is fantastic, big notes of citrus, heavy on the grapefruit, but with a nice amount of tropical fruits, mango, papayas and pineapple come to mind. A healthy amount of grassy and dirtier pine-like hops come through as well, very bitter that cuts the brightness and sweetness very well, almost no malt presence to speak of, some faint biscuit hides in the shadows of huge hoppy aromas. The flavors are wonderful, huge bright notes of citrusy hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, the tropical sweeter flavors are there, some pineapple and mango, but again, a wonderful bitterness from some dry pine and weedy flavors, just a super dank hop profile. Like the aroma, only the faintest biscuity malt can be detected underneath a potent hop forward palate. Nice full body, coats the mouth really well, goes down super easily, remains wonderfully dry and bitter, keeps you coming back without leaving an unpleasant cotton mouth experience. "
"I've had this enough in a can to be able to appreciate it, but it was nice to have had the opportunity to get it straight from the source and as fresh as possible."
Poured into a tulip.
Poured into a pint glass. Can split with a friend.
"A: I did pour a little out to review :) Beautiful, crisp, clear yellow. Thick bright white head. No lacing."
"I journeyed North into the Green Mountain state to get it, and I would say the trip was well worth it. "
"Heady Topper came out the can looking like a muddy stream but settled in the glass looking reasonably presentable. Its complexion really varies depending on the angle and closeness of the light, ranging from clear straw yellow to thick mango smoothie. Heady does not have much head, nor does it show any signs of carbonation. "
"Well, somehow PA finally got some fresh Heady Topper directly from The Alchemist via Origlio Beverage. I will say the announcement was made it was coming and it showed up at stores 2 days later. This beer is fresh! So glad to have a chance to drink this liquid gold (know where my review is going??)"
finally. a beer that lives up to the hype. 
"1/2 OF A 16OZ CAN poured into a regular pint glass, while drinking the other half out the CAN. Excited to see this in Philly. I bought it with ease. Purchased a single at Capone's and a 4-pack from the bottle shop at Local 44. Props to Origlio for pulling in a great brewery, it's about time you guys found some new blood."
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter
"I have been meaning to review Heady Topper for a few weeks now but this seems like as good of a time as any. Thanks to my brother (Mitchell) for going way out of the way to pick up a case while in Vermont. While I will agree with many that Heady will not be winning any awards for appearance, it certainly deserves ever bit of its rating on BA. Heady Topper is definitely one of the best IIPA’s I have ever drank in my life. The hops come in waves and while it never overpowers you it continuously lets you know you are drinking an IIPA. It is scary because it is so drinkable that I could throw back a few of these without hesitation but at 8% is will definitely let you know you have been drinking. It starts off with wave after wave of piney citrus hops in the nose. The hops are present but very drinkable with the same piney citrus mouth feel. This beer is unbelievable as sip after sip coats your mouth with a wave of hops. This beer is definitely better cold as it looses some of the wonderful characteristics as it warms. Follow the instructions on the can and drink it fresh, cold, and from the can and you will not be disappointed!"
big ups to OsNJCB for sending this as an extra!
"Heard great things about this beer, so when i finally made my way to the brewery i bought an entire case to bring back home because they don't distribute in my area. anyhoo, it was one of the greatest beers I have ever had. What really got me was the aroma, i was practically drinking with my nose. I also love how it comes in a four pack of 16 ounce cans, not a 22 ounce bottle like most of those world class beers. I am definitely making another trip up for some more. The only thing I thought can be a bad thing or good thing i guess is you will have that delicious taste in your mouth for a while. So if you are having any other beer, it may taste like Heady Topper!"
16oz can into a tall snifter
"1pt can poured into a snifter (sorry, I could not drink this straight out of the can, no matter how much persuasion is written on it.  I have one more and maybe I will.  It just seems wrong though)"
"FINALLY! Thanks Dave! Pours a hazy/cloudy golden-orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is just what anyone would want in a DIPA...such lovely hop aroma! Tropical hops with intense, bitter pine notes. Smells so fresh and hoppy...pineapple, grapefruit, melon, pine sap, guava, orange, lemon...SO INVITING. Taste is lacking in the malt profile...which is GREAT! Being from the west coast, this is just what I like. A little bit of malt, but not enough to make this delicious brew lose any points. Lovely citrus and tropical fruit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. No lingering bitterness with this beer...crisp and clean. The palate is miraculously wiped clean after a few seconds of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of flavor, and crisp finish. Drinkability is Very High. ABV not even noticeable. Overall, this was a great experience. I am very impressed considering this drinks like a west coast style DIPA...love the lack of malt. I wish I had regular access to this so I could drink it like the can recommends... straight from the can. Brilliant beer!"
What needs to be said about this beer that hasn't already? Popped out of a can into my tulip. 
Thanks to dude from PT
"unsure of when it was canned, but it sure smells fresh. part of a trade with gn0sis - thanks! poured into a Deschutes snifter a bit warmer than I needed to (I got home, saw the box, and pulled it straight out instead of giving it any time in the fridge. Couldn't wait!)."
Drinking from the can because the can said so. Poured 25cl into a Boulevard tulip so I can judge the appearance and try it from a glass.
"Served from a can into a tulip. I won't drink from the can, instructions be damed."
Thanks to bentwookie for this big want. Tulip glass.
"Oh my god!!! they really hit this one out the park, smells like citrus, grapefruit,and pine. just had a zombie dust the other day and this one is just as nice of a tasty beer. one is not enough, makes you want to have more and more again. and this all comes from a can WOW."
"pours a very hazy peach color with loads of sediment floating around and white ring. The nose has a fair bit of citrus and notes of grapefruit. Faint undertone of a sweet caramel malt. The flavor is nice, sweet hops and malts blend together but seems well attenuated. Light grapefruit and bitter citrus round off the dominant hop presence as the bitterness lingers for a moment but doesn't disrupt the drinkability. The body is very inviting with a gentle tingling carbonation and a smooth soft feel to it."
"Oh wow... so much going on with this special brew... It's such a joy to enjoy... Heaven in a can. The color is a cloudy, deep orange amber; fruity and lively with just the right balance of hoppiness, fruitiness and boldness. And it comes from a CAN!!!"
"Well, Heady Topper only being sold locally is both a blessing and a curse... This beer lives up to all the hype. Wave after wave of insanely fresh hops, with absolutely explosive aftertastes. I stick to The Alchemist's recommendation, and drink it straight from the can, so it's tough to comment on appearance, but that's hardly necessary for this big, fresh double IPA. In spite of being a slightly lower ABV than many double IPAs, it packs a bit of a punch, probably because the alcohol is entirely covered up by the hops. Make sure you drink it fresh, and don't fear drinking it out of the can!"
BIG thanks to kalvarez for this
From BeerAdvocate magazine Issue #58 (November 2011):
Review #100! Big thanks to Fijii13 for this one. 16 oz. can poured into pint. Decided to ignore the request on the can for reviewing purposes. Had the second straight from the can.
"Appearance: Pours out a hazy, light yellow-orange body strewn with fine particles and topped with a barely off-white head."
First shot at trying this. Poured into a plain snifter to judge appearance and aroma. Four pack got in a trade with youbrewidrink.
16oz can - thanks to zuma for this
"Huge, huge thanks to Jesse (arniepnminne) for hooking me up with this!"
16 oz can into my Pretty Things pint glass. Kudos to Erik for bringing this back from VT. I am eager to try it. 
"A- Deep golden in color, very hazy nice foamy white head that sticks around for awhile a lot of lacing nice looking beer."
"Out of the can, from multiple fresh deliveries in VT. Thee hops, citrus, pine, and malt come together perfectly. Not the biggest fan of drinking from cans, but it seems thats the brewers preference. Not much booze until it warms up, which makes that 8% catch up with you fast, but the cans also warns you off this. Listen. The can makes it feel like a session beer but it's far for a session beer. Def one of my favorites, but meant to be shared, paired, and part of tastings"
Big ups to woodchopper for hooking me up
On draft at Blind Tiger.
First - thanks to MRMOJORISIN for bringing cans to our annual ABB-festival.
A: Poured a small amount in a glass to see this. Bright golden color with a small white head for as much as I poured. Drank the rest out of the can.
"Here we go. Taking a shot at reviewing this beast. Had many times before, first review of it."
Special thanks to a very kind individual who brought this back from vacation. 
"A- Chunks and chunks of floating shit in this brew. Looks like a lava lamp, or the Long Island sound during late summer. Nice foamy head at first, fades away and leaves a nice ring of lacing. I have never seen a beer this disgusting to look at. Looks like a bunch of lugees floating in my beer."
"Pours a hazy, light tangerine with a two-finger bright white head. Good lacing and head retention. Aroma, wow. Fresh pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange and just a touch of pine that is outdone by the huge, fresh fruity notes. This beer is so refreshingly hoppy. Big tropical fruit notes, pineapple is giant. Juciy, fresh grapefruit and orange notes. Nice pine notes add some bitterness too. Hugely hoppy, but with the perfect amount of bitterness. Get different hop notes with each sip and they keep coming. Awesome drinkability, the hop blend goes down like a Gatorade. Overall, the best DIPA I've had to date. Really tough to make this big of a beer this easy to drink while maintaining absolutely huge flavor."
"Well, I was going to just do a quick ""had"" review. That was until I popped the can open and took a whiff. Whoa man...this is perfection in a tall boy can!"
Poured from a 16oz can into an imperial pint. But not the whole can. Just a bit of it for appearance testing. Big thanks to BA redbird on this one.
"Can (thanks Stephen): Poured a cloudy light yellow color ale with large chunks of protein floating around and a large foamy head with good retention. Aroma of super intense pine hops notes with some citrus and resin notes. Taste is also a super intense mix of pine, resin and light citrus undertones hops with a dry malt backbone that is hard to distinguish from the hops attack. The floral aromas are huge end very enjoyable. Body is full with great carbonation. I must admit the hype is totally justified for this one, truly one of the great IIPA."
"A: A bright tangerine orange is dense with large, bran colored floaties. Dancing yeast cake is evidence of a good swirling carbonation. Frothy cream colored head sits well with a respectable amount of lace. One, I love a ipa that stays true to tradition and stays pale, without the influence of toasted specialty grains. Two, I love the extra visual of dancing yeast floaties, like a snow globe adding not only a visual sense but some vitamins as well."
"I wish I had poured this out, but my host insisted we drink it from the can. Despite this, it smells full of hops with fantastic nose from THE CAN! Other canned beers (Oscar Blues, Hazed and Infused) can't touch this!"
"Huge, huge thanks goes out to aasher, one of the best BA's out there for hooking me up with this beer. Not only am I grateful to Al for this can but I'm also grateful for the Surly Darkness snifter I poured a sampled into (the rest being enjoyed from the can per the brewery's guidance). "
16 oz can poured into a pint glass at slightly warmer than fridge temperature.
A- Pours an orange color with a fairly thin white head. This beer is pretty ugly with a lot of hop leaf/pellet junks floating around. Head leaves a bit of spotty lacing.
Appearance - Pale cloudy body that pours little head. Decent lacing on the small amount that I poured into a glass.
Sample: 1 can 2012
16oz can my friend had shipped from a VT hook-up. Served in a snifter. 
Pourer from a 16 oz can into a tulip and also drank from the can- poured a hazy light orange color with almost no head very little retention and no lacing.
"Pours a muddy, opaque light orange with floating sediment. Thin head quickly settles. 4"
Thanks to DarthKostrizer for sharing this one at the post Bruery Reserve Society party bottle share!
Thanks to BeRanger for this one.
pours cloudy yellow gold with lots of sediment small head faded fast left no lacing
Took the first sip from the can to get the full affect.
Canned on Monday drank on Friday. Poured into a glass. 
16 oz cannnn of course.....update status performed on 11/10/17......****
This beer Ive had several times. 
"So if your beer tastes like this, maybe you only need to make one. There's likely no way that you'll ever out do Heady-Topper so just stop right there!"
Holy sweet god. Thanks a ton to Kkottonmouthkngz for including two(!) of these is a random box trade. This was a huge want of mine.
Huge thanks to Treebs for giving this to me as an extra(!) in a trade. Thanks!
"16oz aluminum tall boy. Coded, looks like canned on 1/23/12"
Given to me by a friend who stopped by the brewery last week - a very unexpected and pleasant surprise. Drank from the can.
Serving type can
"One of my pals went down to Vermont 3 weeks ago and picked a few cans of this up at the brewery. Being 3 weeks old, I know it's not at its prime but I'll probably never have another chance to review this."
A - Pours an inch of white head which has nice retention and leaves tons of lacing. The beer is unfiltered resulting in a hazy brew with a pale orange hue.
"Got some of these on a recent beer trip to VT. Glad In did too, man is this one killer IPA. Official review now. PT sized can..."
Have had multiple times since then and updating some things
This is a must try if you fancy yourself a beer drinker... I really was impressed by this beer when I first tried it six or so months ago and I have been buying a few 4 packs a month ever since. 
One of a number of outstanding beers at the Imminent Liquidation tasting. This is a beer I've wanted to try for some time.
The balance of a unique hoppiness with just enough malt combines with a smooth mouthfeel that seems almost surreal given the style of beer. I usually feel a bit more bite in even the better DIPA's I've had previously. 
"A: Poured about 3oz into glass. Murky golden yellow, small head disipates quickly."
"There isn't much that can be said about this holy elixir that hasn't already been said -- aside from the fact that given the opportunity I'd probably crawl in the can to live out the rest of my years (which are most likely a good number). I get to enjoy this usually every month or so, and simply put: it's the best out there. I've had it 7 days old and 7 months old. Nothing beats it fresh but even after half a year it still tastes incredible. Pour half in a snifter and enjoy half in the can. The smell upon cracking that can will blow you away. Definitely my favorite double IPA out there and probably my favorite overall. It will never get old. The hype is real! If you have a chance to get your hands on this, do so...by any means possible. (well maybe not ANY)"
"A - This is what Sting was singing about in ""Waves of Gold."" Beautiful hazy color with slightly less head than I'd want."
I mentioned to a co-worker that I was just in Vermont and found nothing (good) locally other than 'Long Trail' and he hit me with a pint can of Heady Topper - Thanks Will !!! - I poured some into a tulip and left some in the can whilst alternating sips - and before I knew it - it was all gone !! - and i wished I had more - poured hazy and light orange with suspended spherical globules (of the hop resin?) - like a little universe of it's own in my glass - a 1 finger head that dissipated into a slight film reaching out to a 1/4 inch ring - the hops were in the air as soon as i 'pulled the pop-top' - the zing and zest of hops resin was immediate and awesome - just sticky enough with a mildly sweet finish - this beer is amazing for all the right reasons - hype be damned!
"16 oz can poured into a snifter. (Yes, I'm disobedient.)"
"Heady Topper, $9 can at Blind Tiger in NYC, to benefit Vermont farmers affected by Hurricane Irene."
"From the can, as instructed. If there's a canning date, I can't find it."
"Can from pushkinwow, thanks a ton for sending this one over Steve. 16oz can into a tulip, canned January 23, 2012. 700th review."
Live tasting 16 oz can into Duvel tulip...
Huge thanks to beerhan for this awesome extra.
"16oz can...supposedly canned on Feb 14th 2012, but no date noted on the can. Served at around 45F. Big thanks to Ryan for this trade!!!"
"I've been drinking these over the past few months and the batches have varied a bit. All I can say is, if you live near Healthy Living in South Burlington VT, grab a 4 pack today (toward the back). This is the best batch I've had. The tropical juice is just sublime. I did have one batch where I hardly detected any juice, it was most straight up hops. This one is just right. Juicy. Piney."
One of my favorites ... I buy a case every other month or so.
"Pretty stoked to have this beer. Poured some into a glass so I could see it, and the rest I drank out of a can."
This brew is only one word and that is FANTASTIC! totally lives up to all the hype. its a must try before you die beer.
"Had this straight from the can as recommended. Was a little strange as I NEVER drink straight from the can/bottle, but I have to say it worked. Such a well balanced beer I could not believe it. Outrageous hop flavor but zero bitter bite. Excellent malt profile. The sweet hop taste lingered well after I had finished the can."
Thanks to claaark13 for this. 
"Drank straight from the can, which was purchased the same day of canning. This particular can was drank 1 day after canning."
"Big shout out to SilentJay for picking me up a case of this when he was up in VT this weekend and meeting me when I flew into Boston/NH for a few weeks. A mystery box will be coming his way soon. Should have been a batch within a week, two max."
Pours a nice hazy orange a with a big creamy white head on top. A fair amount of sticky lace left behind. 
Reviewing straight from can to mouth per the request of the brewer. Poured a small amount in a Duvel tulip to assess appearance.
can aquired from trade with shcufj. no freshness info.
"I've had many a can of Heady Topper over the past few months, and with each one I'd hoped that my opinion of the beer would change for the better. I'll review my inaugural taste here, as it hasn't changed at all really. 16 oz. can poured into a Duvel tulip. Reviewed from notes."
"My man Dino hooked up a 4 pack which he said was canned a week and a half ago. I immediately opened one. The can says to drink out of the can so for appearance I poured the 2nd can into a pint glass. The beer in glass pours a cloudy golden color, light from the pale malts, good retention and lacing. The rest of this review will be from the can. The aroma is huge and heavy as soon as you crack the beer. Tons of tropical citrus hop character assault your senses. I guess I should have expected as much from the 120 IBUs. I can't tell how this beer could smell any better: no hint of alcohol and an overload of hops. Perfect. The taste build on the aroma, if that is even possible, you again are assaulted with the tropical citrus hop flavor and yet a bit of piney resin is prevalent, too. Unbelievably smooth. Unreal how balanced this beer is. Malty sweetness with fruity character from the hops. Clean. Smooth. Medium bitterness, not over the top, no clue this is 8%abv. Amazing flavor. Again, not sure how this can get any better. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and rich and smooth. Very well balanced. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. Perhaps because it was fresh, this is now the standard for DIPAs, sorry Pliny. I will do whatever I can to obtain more. Terrific."
"A: Pours hazy, golden. Lighter color than I expected but still beautiful. Reminds me of a dank heffeweizen...haze for days. Very little head that dissipates quickly."
"16oz. can, purchased at the brewery. No coding. Told by an employee that it was ""probably"" canned on 2/10/12. It's fresh, okay?!"
"Recieved in a trade along with fresh Hopslam from NDAK, thanks man, we will swap again."
"Appearance- Cloudy orange, can't see threw, small white head with small group of bubbles in the middle, head dissipates quickly. The cloudiness makes me think there is a ton of hops in it. "
"Appearance: N/A Enjoyed from the can, as the brewer recommends"
"I scored 3 four packs of this beer thanks to my parents who had vacationed briefly in VT. Trying this out of a glass first, then out of the can for kicks and giggles... because it says so. Something about releasing the hop aromas. "
"I’m torn here. The brewers leave instructions on the can. Rather than enjoy the beer poured out into a glass, as common sense dictates, they wish us to drink it straight from the can. Normally, I’d do as the brewer says, no questions asked. This kind of goes against my principles though. In the end I decided to enjoy it from my New Belgium globe, though I did decant it, again, as dictated on the can. If I’m ever able to score another can or two or this, I’ll try it straight from the can and see which experience I find more enjoyable."
Thanks to my Fraternity brother Devin who lives out in VT now for sending me two 4 packs of HT.
Got a 4-pack from a friend who just returned from Waterbury. Probably as fresh as it comes directly from the cannery. 
"Side by side comparison with Hopslam. Pounder can poured into a tulip. This can was bottled in mid-December. My girlfriend has just gotten into DIPAs, so she is enjoying this too! It should be a good night!"
"Poured in a tulip at the British Beer Company in Walpole, MA."
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to a straight-lipped Ommegang flute (the glass included in the 2011 gift packs), but sampled partly from the can for tasting and aroma notes as well. No date on the can, but one week ago the (very, very good) friend who gave this to me said he bought it the weekend prior, so my guess is this is 2 ½ - 3 ½ weeks old at the most. I’d say it’s pretty fresh. And yes, I did drink this from the can first! "
A: Poured some into a glass just to see what it looks like. It's a super cloudy pale sort of orange. Good solid offwhite head. Retention is quite good too. Decent lacing. 
My son brought this home after a trade for a 4 pack of this for a Dark Lord.
16 oz. can poured into oversized CBS snifter.
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
Drank from 16oz can from a 4-pack as instructed to get maximum hop flavor.
"Many, many thanks to BAs hoppymcgee and jedwards for sending Heady Topper cans within mere days of each other; as this is one from a 4-pack sent by hoppymcgee, I'm reviewing it."
Un. Real. 
"Ok I will admit it - I did not believe the hype. So many times beers that are hyped up so much let me down, but this absolutely delivered. "
"Enjoyed my first two Heady Topper's today. Purchased from Woodstock Hops N Barley in Woodstock, VT."
Received a couple cans of fresh HT from BaconSausage as extras in a recent Trade.
"This was canned freshly last week and was sent to me through the mail. Something everyone on this website must try, my pallate was in heaven during the consumption of this hoppy yet amazing beverage"
"16oz can with ""1 12 23A 2 BB"" stamped along the bottom of the can. Not sure what this means, but I'm assuming the 1 if for January and the 12 for 2012?"
Served in a Rogue shaker pint glass.
Big thanks to Mrebeka for grouping this with a trade… I owe you one!
"A pint can, poured into my DFH Signature Glass. I'll enjoy this beer in a glass-just like every beer is meant to be drank."
"Gifted to me from eyebrews, one outstanding beer lover and guy."
WOW... if this review would accept just a WOW and not making me use 250 characters! WOW is all you need to know! 
"heady thanks to heelsn02 for the can. unexpected after he gave me a blind tasting of this, Pliny, and hopslam. "
"A day when a box of gems and treats arrived from some friends. A Variety of Russian River Brews, KBS, Parabola, BA Old Raspy. "
"Can given to me by andrewinski1. Much gratitude. Poured into a large snifter, consumed at cellar temp."
"I poured this and drank this out of the can, just prefer the glass anyways.."
Drank from a 16oz can... Thanks to Brett for giving me this can
1 of 6 beers we tried in a blind taste test made possible by some awesome trades.
poured from can into Ithaca Beer pub pint glass (I don't know what the real name is...) as I prefer to see the beer I am drinking even though they say to drink it out of the can
"This is the most amazing beer I've ever had. The chunks in the beer are a tiny bit off-putting, but they're the result of the extreme amount of hop resins in the beer. I'll take the resins anytime if that's the trade-off."
A beer that can hold its own with Pliny!
"Drank one from can, one from glass, liked it from the glass better so I will review from glass."
16 oz can into Piraat tulip glass
132nd Review
Big thanks to MBAcoach for sending this my way. 
scored a 4 pack from jamvt via trade. thanks a ton for the swap Jeremy
"Thanks Ashley for the trade again for some fresh heady. Poured from the can into a snifter, amber golden color with nice initial head that recedes quick with sticky lacing rim. Cloudy and chunky but so damn inviting. Nose is great with hops hops and floral aromas. Taste is the king on the heady. Explosion of hops and bitterness that is balanced on initial hit to the palate and then the hops and piney bitterness builds. The finish on this beer is amazing. "
"Poured from a chilled can into my iced Cigar City pint glass. I know the rage is to drink this delight from the can, but I will offer another perspective."
reviewing the taste 1st out of the can as suggested before i pour in a glass to review the rest. 
"Picked up in Burlington, before a gig at the Radio Bean..."
"Drank straight from the can, but I poured a small amount in to a snifter to rate the appearance even though I feel like it is tough to rate on that since the brewer clearly wants it to be drank from the can."
"Heady Topper from can into a snifter. 3 day old can from cannery, reviewed from notes."
Cloudy brownish orange body with tiny floaters. The head is brief and thin. 
Thanks Ted!
Thanks to Adrian for this one.
"This is a really good beer. The can says to drink from the can, so who am I to disobey a direct order. I can't really judge the appearance this way, but the can has a cool design. The smell is a certain citrusy aroma with hints of the can mixed in the smell. The taste is perhaps the most balanced DIPA. the hops are not overpowering, and the flavor is exceptionally complex. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, and a sour hop flavor come to the forefront. The most remarkable element is the smooth mouthfeel. One might even say it goes down soft. The aftertaste does not limit the experience, but takes it in a different direction. The citrusy flavors sweeten like candy. Most DIPAs express punch of bitter hops at this point, so this was surprising and refreshing. This beer is definitley worth the hype."
Picked up a couple six-pack at the cannery. I'm told they were packaged just a week ago.
Recieved in a trade with Fluke828! What a great guy! Thanks man.
"Canned on Tuesday, Drank on Wednesday (from the can, naturally)."
A: Poured a vibrant golden amber with a huge white fluffy head that I could eat with a spoon. Retention and lacing were phenomenal. Looks much darker than expected.
Drank from the can mostly. 
no date on the can...
"I was brewing beer with friends when this appeared out of the fridge and in my glass. It's blood-orange and gold appearance made me wonder as the story of how it wound up in Rocky Point, NY was explained to me. "
Many thanks to Jordan23 for the awesome surprise!
"A - Pours a straw yellow, very hazy, with a foamy two finger white head. Speckled lacing clings nicely. "
"16 oz can poured into a Sierra Nevada Tulip, shared with KevinmusPrime, reviewed from notes"
Received in trade w/ a VT BA (Cheers!)
"This one pours pretty cloudy, with little bits floating around. If you pour it into a glass (which I prefer, but the brewery discourages), leave the dregs, as you would a homebrew. "
"One of the beers in it's class. We are very lucky to have this beer up here in Vermont. The taste, as it should be, is the best part to this beer. It tastes great from the can or in a glass (even though it recommends drinking it straight from the can. The appears is good and the smell is great very fruity. Outstanding taste and a great overall beer. Hard to top this one!"
"Picked up a fresh 4-pack at the Healthy Living Market in Burlington, Vt. Definitely one of the more beautiful cans I've ever purchased."
From 16oz tallboy to my Hess Imperial pint glass on 12/15/11
Big thanks to Jason for getting me a can of this! I drank it from the can but poured some out to get a look at the beer.
16oz can divided between a snifter and the can.
A christmas present from duffextra cold. 
16oz can. Poured 4oz sample glass and drank the rest from the can.
"After I had a few sips from the can, as suggested by the brewery, I poured it into a tulip glass to have a look.   I'm glad I did! It's an attractive one!  A nice finger of head develops and the color is that of dried apricot fruit. There is a small amount of sediment floating about, but not much and it doesn't detract.  The head dissipates to nearly nothing, but some ultra fine lace remains that sticks to the glass with every sip. "
"I have had 3 batches of the canned heady topper, the first was great, the third was great, but the second batch i had canned sometime in mid november was absolutely sublime."
16 oz. can brought straight from the brewery. Drank first half from the can as per the instructions and then second half I had to pour into my dogfish snifter to take a look at this great brew.
Can poured into a couple Spaten glasses. Thanks so much to Azdback for sharing this with me!
"Cracked the can and poured into a glass. A nice orange color with lots of head and tons of shit floating in it. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the floaties but I certainly needed to deduct some points for that. I would normally just drink it from the can, as the can states, so it would not be an issue for me. This is a hop bomb, plain and simple. It is up there with the best of the best hop bombs. I love this beer and you will too."
"Received a 1 PINT can of this from mdvatab in a recent trade (fresh!). Poured from the silver can w/ the ""Alchemist"", HEADY TOPPER, & DRINK FROM THE CAN! all in black into a 16oz pint glass (but only half the can). Enjoyed the rest straight from the can so I could review half and enjoy ""how it should be"" the rest. Has 11020B2BB on the back but no sign of freshness date. "
"This beer is magical. Had it brewery direct via a couple buddies just a few days after it was ""canned"". This is by far the best IIPA I have ever tasted. I'm sorry Pliny. "
"Thanks to tjkinate for this one. The infamous Heady Topper! Now I can say I've had the three best DIPAs out there (Heady, Abrasive, and PtE). Served from the can with a bit poured into my Darkness snifter for appearance. "
Thanks to Jeff and Erik for sharing this one during the BA tasting in Utrecht. Had this one side-to-side with the Dreadnaught IPA
"A : Golden to amber color, large bubbles, some chill haze, some hop/protein coagulates, but if allowed to sit, you can decant most of this off if it bothers you (doesn’t bother me). Not much lacing or head retention."
I finally made the 3 hour drive to get some Heady Topper.
"Inflatablechair supplied this one at a recent tasting.... badass... finally, I got to try Heady topper."
From a glass with about a third from the can.
"Canned on Dec 13, 2011. Poured in to CBS Snifter. "
"Pours an inch tal white head. Spotty lacin, average head retention."
"16oz can, Sam Adam's Perfect Pint and red wine glass, canned 12/6/11. Huge, big thanks to Jayli in Secret Santa 2011!"
Fresh from the can...then poured into my Darkness snifter.
Thanks to cbeer88 for this one!
I had this beer during a very nice tastingsession at doopiedoopiedoo's house where a bunch of Dutch BA came together.
I was able to try this beer at a tasting organized by Jeffo and Doopiedoopiedoo. Read some more about the tasting on my review of The Brewery - Black Tuesday. 
"Thanks to satchboogie on shipping this one in a trade. Phenomenal nose, as good as Pliny or Hopslam. I really would say for my taste these 3 would b interchangeable as far as which one I like best. Number ratings don't tell how even they are. I drank from a glass on the first one can the next two. Looks great as fresh world class DIPA should, nice foam and you can get lost with your nose in the glass. Citrus, and lost of it, smooth hops, and a lot of that too, On my 1st can I was thinking of Pliny in a way to compare, but after having a few over the last few days I'm changing that up a bit. It comes on first sip like Pliny, then somewhere along the line the overwhelming hops kicks in and it's more similar to Alpines Pure Hoppiness. Nicely bitter, but not crushingly so, balanced as hell. Just a tremendous brew, surely equal to anything brewed anywhere that's a DIPA. It this was easily available I'd be 300 lbs."
"Joe you are the man and thank you for this one. alright from notes i reviewed this one at a christmas party, which i ran away to a dark corner to review like a zero. have to start off with the awesome can, silver and black tall boy with the alchemist on the front lovin life. pours a deep transparent amber with a big off white head and it shows great retention. solid in the nostrils very citrusy with light pine and lemon peel dryness. very fresh hops and minimal malt sweetness, pale and biscuty. the taste is absolute cash, very fresh hop resin, again the citrus peel with an amazing bitterness that cuts the palate. bone dry finish. medium bodied and lightly carbonated and flows really easy without any ""spiking"" to my surprise. this is the one that will make your gf not want to kiss you, the one where your breath still reeks of hops the next morning. flying hop dragons punching babies, can't stop em'. what a brew!"
16 oz can.
Straight from the can while at Frida's for lunch in Stowe. The tacos were good; the beer was freakin' unbelievable. 
"Pours golden orange with a head that is thick and fluffy and retains. Aroma of bold citric and piney hops that is in your face in a good way, generous malts to back it up. Taste follows nose, so good so amazing. Smooth and easy to drink, I love this beer, it will perpetually stay in my wants!"
The Alchemist Heady Topper
Huge thanks to mar for trading me this can.
"A: Pours a hazy, hop particle filled, reddish-orange color with a thick billowing white head that slowly retracts to a couple centimeters. Leaves a ton of lacing as sipped down."
"Can picked up straight from The Alchemist Cannery. This specific can is a bit more than a month old. I enjoyed two out of glasses over the last few weeks. As the can suggests, I am reviewing this directly from the can."
"This batch was canned on December 7th, and I drank it on December 13th so it's an extremely fresh batch. Was poured into a snifter. Poured an amazing 3 finger head which stuck around for a good while. The color is a glossy orange. Smells like anything citrus. Oranges are a big aroma in this beer. The smell is intense and when you take a drink you can taste everything that you smell. Alcohol is barely present as the flavors balance the beer out very well. A bit of bitterness at the end, but like I said, everything is balanced well. "
16oz can 
This review is comprised from notes taken on multiple days from multiple cans consumed from either a snifter or the can itself as suggested. There really isn’t much difference between the can and glass version. 
Reviewing the Heady Topper from The Alchemist.
"It's in a can. It appears as a silver can. I got the last bit of the can at a tasting, and at the can's insistence, consumed it out of the can."
Got this as an extra in a trade with Plenum. Cheers buddy! 
"Can't really tell what it looks like until you pour it out, comes out a hazy witbier (now with bigger chunks!) looking beer, but the vibrancy of the golden color is still nice, ample head size."
Huge thank you for DrewShal9 for this!
Thank you Lambicking for 12 cans of this. Truly my favorite beer.
Served in a Duvel Tulip
"Big thanks to THE CPJ for the beauty, been wanting to try it for some time. Drank from the can as instructed, except for a tiny 2oz pour to grade appearance."
Purchased at the Alchemist Cannery on a beerventure and poured into my Duvel tulip.
"16oz can, huge thanks to Kevin (thebouch01) for scoring this at the Jackie O's release and handing it over to me!"
"I got this can from someone at the CL release, basically as a present. I don't remember the BA handle, but he's opening a brewery in Jersey. Thanks!"
A: Pours a clear honey color; barely any head or lacing
Poured from a 16oz can to a Cigar City Snifter.
Thanks to LambicKing for this one. Lives up to all the hype
Poured into a tulip glass for appearance...the rest of the review is from the can as the brewer intended.
"Dare I call this beer perfect? Without a doubt one of my favorites. I've never had the pleasure of having one on tap, but upon cracking a can, the smell of hops overpowers everything within arms length - it's really quite impressive. While John Kimmich recommends drinking out of the can, I drank one from the can, one from the glass. "
"Drank from a can, just like it says."
Poured from a 22oz Can into a 4oz Snifter. 
"well, there's some hype about this one, and I hate trains, but I'm on it. Was lucky to get 16 heady's through a trade in person in Bruges, thanks Hopo ;-) Already had a couple of previews through tendermorsel, and knew what I was getting. "
HUGE thanks to my awesome girlfriend for bringing me a can of this back from thanksgiving break.
Very hazy amber pour. Sediment is suspended throughout. Two fingers of pillowy off white head. Scant lacing is left behind on my glass. Hops and citrus collide in my nose. Looks and smell are living up to the hype. The first striking character upon taste is the creaminess. Incredibly so especially for an ipa. Pine and grapefruit up front. Sweetness to finish the swallow. Ends lightly bitter. Honestly it is not as hoppy as I expected. Very easy to drink regardless that it is an imperial. 
"Reviewed from a pair of fresh 2 day old cans. One was poured into a Duvel tulip, and one drank straight from the can for comparison. "
finally getting around to reviewing this. about 10 days since its canning. poured into my hill farmstead pint glass. 
A fresh can into a standard pint glass.
"One of only a few 4 packs left at a Burlington area grocery store. The beer guy said it would be gone soon, as the first order of 160 cases disappeared in less than 4 days."
Huge thanks to mkabull and AutumnBeerLove for sending me fresh cans(on the same day)! 
"Thanks to mtardiff for sending me a 4 pk. No canned on date. Against the recommendation on the can, I poured into a snifter."
Poured from a 16oz can into a Duvel Tulip - totally ignoring the instructions to drink from a can (I'll drink the next one from the can). Thanks to rhong187 for the hookup.
Thanks to jsthomas for sending this to me.
"Had this on 2011-11-20 in Columbia, PA. This was canned four days ago. I've had this about twelve more times since this initial review (most recently on 2018-06-02 on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly) and it remains very high on my list."
"Thanks go out to Ryan for hooking me up with this stellar double IPA. I have had it a couple times now, both directly from the can and decanted into a pint or tulip on various occasions."
Big thx to Hopopotomous for this awesome DIPA !!
Poured into my Jackie O's snifter. Shared with IrishColonial.
"A: straight out of the can and if this were a woman, I would be in trouble for saying that this is one nice can. Cheesy joke for you guys!"
A: Pours a very hazy light apricot/peach color. One of the cloudiest IPA's i've seen. Definitely unfiltered. The head is thin and pretty white.
16 oz can pour straight into the mouth. Thanks go to Funkel81 for this generous extra in a recent trade. 
Served in an unchilled beer glass.
16oz can poured into a snifter
Poured from a 16 oz can into a Sierra Nevada hop tulip glass.
picked up a case of these gems over the weekend. 
Thanks to loftis CT for the hookup!
"A- Thick, creamy looking body and a super sticky head. Long long long lasting retention, beautiful two fingers developed easy from the pour into my glass. Tons of singular bubbles give me the hope of a crisp tall drank. The perfect lacing... its been a long time since I've seen a work of art such as this. This deep amber, almost like a warmed caramel coloration does tons for me. "
16 oz. can. Canned 2 weeks ago.
"Reviewed From Notes, Poured into a Tulip on 11/12/11"
"16 oz can, part poured into tulip, part sampled from the can as suggested. Thanks to Titosupertramp for this one. "
"Big thanks to gtreid for sendin me home after our tasting with a can of this! Pours a clear honey orange color first followed by all the yeast towards the bottom of the can. The floaties are everywhere! Looks like a gelatin almost. Smells like a tropical Christmas tree - big pine sap, pineapple, mango, and sweet malts. Hop bomb from the get go, but not so bitter, just really delicious citrus hop characters. Not incredibly complex, but just brewed to near perfection. This has to be my favorite DIPA next to Pliny the Elder. If you haven't had it, you've got to get some."
"A+ in my book, just a fantastic and well rounded beer."
"Longtime reader first time reviewer, not that I need to. The jury is already in on this beer. As a die hard IPA/DIPA chasing the latest and greatest available to me I just have to say this beer is a double edge sword. This IPA is so fantastic, that if it is not readily available to you and you are a diehard hophead I and others I know would nearly recommend not trying this beer and especially if you do not have more than a couple in your possesion. This beer has nearly ruined many other IPAs and DIPAs for me, I still enjoy them, but this has clearly set the standard. Also, I truly agree, do drink from the can, it is better than in a glass. I look forward to my first from a tap though. Warning over, onto my brief review. This beer bursts with grapefruit, citrus, lemon? white fruit and some very clean pine. Just amazing flavors that seem to change as you go through the can. The malt backbone is right where Ilike it in a beer of this strength. Its subtle but full arriving just before the fruit of the hops set in and leaves just in time for the bitterness to take over and make you want more. I try to limit myself to one of these per session so that it remains so special. As a last note, I do not know what hops are in this beer but I think columbus and cascade are here, for all I know there are many more."
Appearance: Beautiful golden body with a sizable head and great lacing.
16oz can thanks to youbrewidrink. 
Thanks goes to nathanjohnson for the chance to try this beer.
Can from Dr Greg - grazie amigo! Shared with buds. Poured a cloudy orange with a decent white head Nose is lemon / grapefruit citrusy and huge on the hops. Taste is slippery sweet and well integrated among the hop resins and citrus / fruit flavors. Finished off with a nice bitterness and soft bite. The lasting finish is well balanced. Loved this one.
"Notes from several weeks ago, fresh can."
"woah. orange-amber with a slight haze. off-white head with good retention and pretty lace. nose is grapefruit, orange, blood-orange, pineapple, mango, papaya, passionfrut, piney tropicalness harmonized near-perfectly with a caramel graininess that simply rocks. taste is all of the above with the perfect amount of bitter/dry to balance. this is as heady as it comes. yes, I said heady. bitter in the finish with pine singing, but tropical fruitiness lingering. all good things about hops are here amplified by all good things about malty harmony. thick, yet light and fluffy. fanf'ingtastic. thanks al. and alchemist."
A: Orange colored pour into snifter with off white head leaving moderate lacing. 
"Aroma:Sweet orange and grapefruit, peaches, cotton candy. Smells delightful."
"Despite the declaration on the can to ""drink from it"" i did half in the can and half in a tulip"
Poured from a can to a sniffer. 
"Oh, a beer amongst beers! The Alchemist has done a great justice to the world with the Heady Topper. I've rarely seen a better looking DIPA, smelled a finer flower, nor tasted anything as hoppy and honeyed. I'm not sure what kind of black magic this brewery dabbles in, but this beer is a incantatory balance of hop and malt. It's sweet (but just right), it's hoppy and piney, resin-y, and brilliantly citrus-y. If I ever have an imperial IPA better than this, I might just call it the best I could ever have. I'm serious."
Poured from 16oz can into an Alchemist pint glass.
"As per suggestion I tried this out of the can ""briefly"" and yup, knew it wouldn't work for me. Evaluated by pouring straight down the middle very slowly into a nonic pint glass, letting the head settle, then topping up later. At first about 4 oz was only poured in the nonic pint glass, with the can to be evaluated afterwards."
"16oz cans, love 'em! First beer I've sampled from The Alchemist. Hazy golden yellow/orange pour with a nice creamy white head on top. Lots of hop sediment so be careful on the pour. Aromas are a blast of deep fruity, tropical hops. Such a wonderful, juicy, resinous hop blend that I could easily sit and inhale all night long. I would advise to drink this hoppy treat as fresh as possible."
Thanks to Deuane for giving me one of his cans so I can finally taste the heady. Can poured into a standard pint.
"16 oz can. I had the first few sips from the can and then decided to pour this one into a glass to do get a proper score on appearance. I'll drink any future ones right from the can, I promise."
"16oz can, consumed therefrom."
"Much thanks to Adam for this can, you rock!"
A big thank you to pokesbeerdude for sending this as an extra in his portion of the Willpower LIF.
Huge thanks to mountsnow1010. Cheers!
"Poured into a Surly pint glass. A semi-hazy burnt orange color. Few and far between, large, carbonation bubbles lead to a very small head. As I swirl my glass I get just the smallest hint of, off white colored head. There isn't any lace to speak of."
Wow! Big thanks to Adamdc for sending this beer to me in a trade. Sometimes a beers hype is really spot on. This is one of those times. The can says it should be drank from a can. Force of habit finds me pouring this into a Imperial Pint glass.
My buddy grabbed me two four packs from the Brewery in VT. Fresh canned two days ago!!
"Heady on tap pours hazy dark gold with an enormous fluffy white head. The retention is excellent and the lacing very sticky and attractive. Huge aroma of hoppy complexity; so much going on in the nose, from citrus (mostly grapefruit and pineapple) to pine to floral notes and traces of very slightly onion-like notes as well."
"Received in trade from GoGriz.  Poured from 16oz. can into a Stone snifter.  Beer was a clear, orange color, with a one-finger, white head.  Head quickly faded, leaving behind some faint traces of lacing around the glass.  Moderate carbonation. "
"16oz can (no dates/codes) - thanks again cavedave for this unexpected, unsolicited treat, beer karma lives! - partially poured into a snifter to evaluate appearance; the remainder drunk from the can per the text on the can."
Had at Track 84 10/28
"Pours an amber orange color with a two finger off white head with settles down to 1/4 inch and stays. Very nice tropical aroma with pineapple. mango, and grapefruit. "

898th Review on BA
16 oz. can poured into my cigar city tulip. Thanks go out to andyavalanche for hookin me up with one of my top wants.
Went against the recommendation and poured this puppy up. Deep caramel orange enhanced haziness from hop residues. Immediately the smell is a citrus bomb. This beer combines so many great citrus notes. It is as if the fruit is from some hybrid tree that only grows in Vermont. I would say the grapefruit is the star though. Crisp taste with some tangy bites. Very fresh hop notes. The mouth feel is almost as impressive as the taste. This is almost described as creamy to my palate. Overall this is the best IPA I have tasted.
"Pours orange with a fluffy white head. Nose is bursting with oily hops, orange candy, pine resin. Sticky and delightful. Flavor is a collage of brightly bitter hops, grapefruit rind, orange rock sugar. Finish is long and grapefruity. Very nice stuff."
"Drank directly from the can, as the can itself instructed me to do. The hoppy goodness literally filled the room. I could smell the can from several feet away, beckoning me to come take a sip. I pulled it right from my fridge so I gave it about five minutes before I took my first sip after opening. Probably five of the most grueling minutes of anticipation in my life. There is obviously a lot of hype around this beer so I knew I was in for a treat. "
A-Well it says to drink from the can so I am. The can looks pretty good...
Poured from a 16 oz can shared by fellow BA CosmicEvan. Consumed outbid a snifter. 
"1 pint can poured into SN pint glass. It says drink from the can, but for the sake of review it got poured."
A - Hazy light orange with a thin layer of white head made of extremely small bubbles. Fades to a ring almost instantly.
Just here to say that this thing is definitely worth the hype it always recieved and I am thrilled that they took the leap to start packaging it (cans...awesome!) and thus making it available to everyone.
"1 pint tall can poured into a fantome tulip glass.  I, too, could not bring myself to drink straight out of the can, but I have another one that I will give it a whirl with."
Big thanks to Joey for the hookup on this one...
"Ok, so this is one I'll search for, gladly accept as extras or be willing to trade for again in the future!"
"Although the can warns it will be hazy, it is way beyond that: murky and dirty looking with plenty of floaties and barely any head in spite of a very vigorous pour, Heady Topper does look BAD."
Pours a nice golden color with some haze. Left a nice lacing halfway around the glass. 
"A: Nice golden amber body. Slight amount of white head. I only poured about 2 ounces into the glass because the can specifically advises to ""DRINK FROM THE CAN!"""
"Big thanks to n2185 for the can. Canned 11 October 2011, from what I hear. Enjoyed 21 October 2011, reviewed from notes. I followed the instructions on the can and tried it before I poured it - delicious, and as described, more of the hop aromatics still in the flavor."
16 oz can poured into snifter.
"The silo can opens with a satisfying crack; almost immediately, massive hop aromas begin to make their way through the mouth. As directed, I take sips directly from the can."
"16oz can into a Duvel tulip. Beer was a cloudy amber, with about a finger and a half of creamy white foam. Head didn't stick around for too long, and left minimal lacing along the sides of the glass. "
1 pint can from recent trade with mountainsnow 1010--a big thanks!
"A massive ""thank you"" to optimator13 for this 16 ounce can from my ""Want"" list. Archaic date code reads ""1 07 20A2 B B"" though I'm at a loss for how to accurately convert that to a canning date. Ignoring the ""drink from the can"" instructions near the lip, this one is poured into a Deschutes tulip glass..."
"A chilled can is poured into a mini pint glass (the can advises to drink it right from the can, so I'm pouring out a reviewable amount and will drink the rest sans glassware)."
Poured from a 16 oz. can and served in a DFH signature glass. Big thanks to Mike (Gushue3) for sending me a few of them!
10/19/11- Review of a 16oz can marked 10720A2BB.
16 oz can poured into an alchemist pint glass
"Poured into a snifter despite the can's instructions. I love the ""Don't be a D-bag, recycle this can!"" on the back."
"Received as an extra from mkabull, thanks Alec!"
"This was a trade from Cheezy Blaster, where he shared the best New England has to offer, and I sent along some of Northeast Ohio's best brews. This beer was among the batch, all of which came through unharmed and ready to drink!"
"Drinking about half the can out of a small snifter, the rest from the can."
extremely excited to try this long time want. huge thanks to baconsausage for hooking this up in Growler BIF round 2.
"Traded big for this one - a '11 DL for a four pack of this delicious stuff. Glad the brewery decided to can this beer! Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. There is a bitterness finish, but it is pleasant, aromatic and not harsh at all. Tried this out of a can, but ended up too dangerously drinkable that way."
16oz can poured to a Duvel Tulip.
Acquired in a trade with greenmonstah.
"A big, big THANKS to Damico for this can share. Pours a cloudy orange amber color with a nice white foam head. Aroma of grapefruit and earthiness, with some caramel mixed in. Has a sweet caramel taste with ridiculously perfect dank hop resiny hit. Smooth as can be. The harsh hop hit does not outlast the finish, leaving you with delicate grapefruit notes at the end of this perfection. Not overhyped."
"Thanks to Jnorton00 for this brew. It's better than Pliny (the Elder), but I'm not quite sure if it's Dreadnaught status (my gold standard). However, given it's abv, it's remarkable. The quintessential camping beer (and yes, the can contributes to this moniker). Everything you want and nothing you don't. Better price point and more convenient than Dreadnaught; just can't decide if it's as good or better. I guess it'll take another night of ""research"" to come to a conclusion :)"
"A. Kinda ugly, watery deep yellow. Decent 3cm white head tho. Minor lacing. Nice silver can, which tells you to drink it from the can - I did not. Maybe another time. No canned on date that I can see - how lame. Get with the program, Alchemist, and don't advertise ""drink this beer immediatly"" and then neglect to tell us just how old it is. "
"I was so excited when I got the cans a few weeks ago, I completely forgot to review the damn beer. Anyways, I know it's awesome, and esp in a tall boy can! Tasty crack cans!"
Tasty brew and my first form The Alchemist. 
Big thanks to jsvt for sending a 4 pack down my way. Drank from the can like instructed. Haha. Guess I'll have to review one from the glass next.
"Gift from a buddy up north. Not inlaws, indigestion, or even nagging children could deter him from personally delivering the goods. Good man."
Big thanks to Beefy for this can. 
"Day old can picked up at the new cannery. Despite the advice of the can, poured into a nonic. "
Picked up a four-pack of this last weekend after the bottle release at the Alchemist pub.
"Graciously offered by hoppymcgee in our most recent trade; what a huge treat, big shoutout. "
"Drinking FROM THE CAN, no pour."
Thanks to KickInTheChalice for the pour.
Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for dropping this in my box.
"16 oz can. No canning dates. Poured into a glass, despite the fact the can tells me not to."
"A - A delightful deep orange, even the head, which was two fingers of irregular froth dithering to an uneven lace (really a sloppy cobweb) has an orange hue. Sediment chunks that float about make this the Goldschlager of DIPAs. "
"Poured a cloudy orange-amber with a finger of loose white head. Aroma of sweet caramel, tangerine, grapefruit, and light pine."
Provided to me by good friend and fellow BA rfgetz...
"Can purchased at the source one week ago, canned two days before that, so yeah its fresh..."
Poured from a 16oz can into my Alchemist tumbler. (14oz poured into the glass). Purchased from the cannery on 10/9/11.
"Mr. Topper, we finally meet. Via Fluke828 and AleLovinRuskie."
"Can courtesy of andrewinski1, thanks again!"
16oz can poured to my La Fin Du Monde tulip.
"Huge thanks to sixthglass for this one. Tim came into my store on Friday to share this then came back on Monday to share a Westy 12 and gave me this can of Heady Topper for a Ten Fidy. Great BA, thanks Tim!"
"Pours a hazed golden amber color with good cap of soapy white bubbles, good retention and lacing. Scent hits the nose with a big rush of tropical and citrus fruits... grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange... slight presence of malt, finishes with a hint of grass. Taste starts off with a quick little bitter punch but quickly moves into a cocktail of tropical fruit with light citrus, again a faint presence of malt and a grassy and piney note at the end. Medium bodied, good carbonation, lacking some oily body preferred in the style. Overall, fantastic scent and taste make this beer highly drinkable and a great IPA."

"Got a Heady Topper as an extra from Stakem and then the next day a box landed from Tanger that had another one of these cans, I can't tell you how pumped I was to recieve these. Thanks a bunch guys."

Big Thanks to spwalshesq for the trade. Huge want of mine! And so worthy...
Huge thanks to exitmusic00 for giving me one of these. Very generous of you sir! Tried directly from can as well as poured into a tulip.

A- pours a medium amber color with a finger of off white long lasting head.
TheDudeRules was kind enough to share a can.
"Thanks Spence. Pint Can. Super haxzy orange ameber with a medium sized white head. Nose is full of hop resin, some sweetness, citrus. Flavor is similarly super resinous, sweet, mild bitterness. Pretty tasty, alcohol slightly noticeable. This is a very good beer and if you like super resinous double ipa's than this is probably your thing. To me, it was a little too sweet and green and lacked complexity."
This beauty was given to me by Jeffo from Tendermorsel from some other guy. Thank you all!
16oz can poured into a Pint Glass. Thanks to RSchaeffer for the 4 pack.
"I'm following the instructions on the can to bypass the glass. Appearance the last time I poured it was a light copper that was a little hazy. Head was decent despite low carbonation. By the way, I love this giant can, especially that they worked in the term ""d-bag"" on the back."
16 oz. can poured into a pint glass. Color is hazy and golden.
"16 oz. can poured into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip. Deep golden, almost amber body with a fluffy white head that fades into a faint ring. Lots of floaties and other things dancing around in my glass."
"Fresh can poured into a tulip glass (even if the can tells you to drink it straight out of the can, maybe for the next one). Thanks to AshleyMiller for the fast trade. Beer pours a dark bronze, very very hazy with lots of particles suspended in the beer making it so that you cannot see through the glass. Initial finger of off white bubbly head, mostly small and medium bubbles, recedes to a nice collar of bubbles and wispy film across the surface. Lots of gentle carbonation visible near the edge of the glass, floating slowly up. "
Thanks to Aberration for this can. Shared and reviewed with Kiddynamite920. Poured into two tulips at 50 degrees.
"Funny story about this beer. At BOREFTS a couple nights ago, an American gentlemen asked me what American brews I'd really love to try. After thinking for a few seconds, Heady Topper jumped straight into my head. Love me some big IPAs, and this was the most recent well-regarded example on the market. Not one hour later I meet tendermorsel at the festival and he pulls two cans for us out of his backpack! The Secret really does work. Thanks for sending these over GoGriz, and thanks for doing the dirty work tendermorsel. "
"Big thanks to both Mtardiff & BearsonAcid for providing this one. In one week I went from never having this beer to clutching 6 cans in my hand. This is the last of the six and needless to say, I’ll be getting more…. Somehow. Great beer. In fact, this review is being done with ½ the can in a glass and ½ being consumed out of the can. After all, that’s what the brewer tells you to do. (drink it from the can)"
"16 oz. can poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass (despite the instructions to drink it from the can....well maybe I had one sip). Orange/amber/brown sugar/gold in color. Very hazy, certainly unfiltered. Not quite white, almost orange creamcicle in color head. It erupts at first and sticks around for a little bit, decent lacing. "

"16oz can provided by MrBarleywine, thanks for hooking me up Mike! "
"Thanks Chris! Heady Topper pours out a hazy orange color, with just a small amount of white heading. Lively carbonation can be noticed, along with some sediment floating around. Very fruit forward nose, with passion fruit, pineapple, mango and a touch of sweet cream. Dank ass hops get things kicked off in the taste, giving off loads of fruit, spice and pine. Mouthfeel is medium in body, and the eight percent is masked perfectly. No doubt this is a world class IPA."
"Beenitty is a total badass and a quality human being. I received this surprise package of 2 very fresh Heady Topper cans in the mail this morning, and could not wait for them to get cold to drink them. This is super fresh- about 11 days old total. What an amazing cool thing for him to do- Beenitty I will get you back man!"
"Batch 2, about 8 days in the can. Poured a bit into my mini Duvel tulip, drank the rest from the can."
"Big thanks to SFLpunk for another fine trade that landed this treat in my hands. Much appreciated Jeff. Poured from a pint sized can into a tulip. This brew appears a hazed copper color. Very fine particulate is stuck throughout the suspension of this brew keeping it from being clear. A solid finger of creamy off-white head sits atop this brew and hold with very solid retaining powers. As the cap slowly fades, it completely coats the entire wall of the glass with an entire wall of lace."
Thanks to my local beer store for this surprise.
"16oz. can served in my ST tulip (just couldn't bring myself to drink it out of the can). Pours a semi-hazy burnt orange with a rocky, one inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some swaths and spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer - grassy, sweet citrus, earthy rind and a slight peppery quality towards the back; incredibly well-balanced. Taste follows nose - earthy bitterness presents up-front and sweet citrus and a suggestion of apricot follows. Finish leaves a slight residual bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation that is lively without being prickly. There's also a slightly oily texture. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it. Hopefully it will make it to Southern Vermont so I can get a bit more regular access. This beer is nothing short of fantastic - the balance is top notch, the alcohol is well-hidden and it is just so easy drinking. In my opinion, can tops bottle on this brew."
Fresh can. I did not follow the instructions on the can. I poured it at fridge temp into an imperial pint glass at.
"Heady Topper pours a turbid orange with a soft white, two finger head. An early pour is relatively hazy while the last dregs contain flocculants that reintroduce themselves into suspension. "
Appearance -- Pours a gently hazed golden toast hue with amber highlights and a slim sudsy white head. Not much in the lacing department.
"Regretfully the brewery got hit hard by Hurricane Irene and only the cannery remains, and thank hop god that it was not impacted."
"This is what a Double IPA should be, and I'm glad to see someone on the East Coast finally making an IPA in a bottle or can to be proud of."
"16oz can with no canned on or freshness date, but I know it is fresh because it is from the first canned batch that was canned not too long ago. I didn't listen to the ""Drink from the can"" instructions and poured into Hair of the Dog tulip. Reviewed on 9/14/11."
16oz can poured into tasting glass - thanks acviencko
Was able to score 3 bottles in trade. This is a late review as I enjoyed the beer a while back.
Thanks Chris.
Enjoyed on our deck as the sun sets behind Camel's Hump.
"Left in the can this time, like the brewmaster suggested. Shared with a friend yesterday, poured a yellow orange with some fairly sticky white head, not it's strong suit. Smell is mango, pine, orange, & a little floral. The best smelling IPA ever, at this point. Taste is same, so perfect. My expectations were sky high and this beer delivered the goods. Mouthfeel wonderful & plenty carbonation. Best DIPA I have had, so easy to drink it is scary. Thanks to Bruce & Rick for leaving this on my porch, like a gift from God."
"And the good Lord shown upon the Alchemist, giving them the good foresight to build a new house before the great flood...Seriously a blessing for them to have this in place when they did. How often does this serendipity happen?"
"Got this beer as a gift from a friend. Canned less than 48 hours before, this beer had it going on! Nose was ripe with pine and a peach like citrus notes. The taste was pretty much the same. HT didn't have the usual very bitter finish of most IPAs. It finished rather subdued and dry, which made it quite drinkable. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy... lots of little bubbles. Truly a fantastic, world class, IPA. Looking forward to getting more of this gem."
"16oz tallboy, straight from the can, less than 24hrs old."
"2nd can consumed the day of the release. First drank from can, second poured into a tulip glass:"
"Just got home from Waterbury and cant wait to try it. Went to The Alchemist about a month ago and wasn't on tap, so this is my first Topper. Yes my first few sips were from the can..."
My thoughts go out to the whole Alchemist crew! It is with this in mind that I raise one of the 72 cans that I just bought! Drank straight from the can!
Drank stright from the can as is suggested on the can.
Shared a 22oz bottle with a very generous friend.
Review from notes. Consumed on 12/12/10.
"On tap at the Alchemist in Waterbury, VT. $4 for a 12 oz. pour. Can't beat that."
"On tap at The Alchemist, 8/1/11. Several 12 oz. pours were enjoyed at a bargain of $4 each. This goes down so easy."
A-As the bartender passes me my first glass I am amazed at the beautiful orange hue of the beer. The creamy head retains incredibly well and laces the whole glass. Just a perfect look.
Tap at The Alchemist (mutliple times over two days)
Tasted on 7/18
"After hearing so much about it and enjoying a visit to the Alchemist last fall when it was not on-tap, I finally got to try Heady Topper the evening before the Vermont Brewers Festival."
First had a taste of this at the VBF 2011. Liked it so much we made our way out to Waterbury for dinner @ The Alchemist Pub on Sunday night. Had four of these with dinner (including one on Cask) along with some other really excellent beers.
On cask at the alchemist! 12oz. pour in a smaller tapered pint glass.
Review from multiple pours at VBF.
On tap at The Alchemist 
"Heady Topper is a treat in and of itself. The Alchemist in Waterbury, VT has been producing wonderful elixers for years, but I personally believe brewed perfection with this IPA. The hoppy aroma just wafts itself in your direction, giving you goosebumps as you anticipate your first sip. "
Pours a nice dark copper/orange with a thin fizzy head. Nice ring of lacing leaves blotchy chunks on the glass.
Look forward to this being canned.
"22oz, thanks to ygtbsm94. "
Had on tap at the Alchemist.
Poured into a tulip glass at the Alchemist
The Heady Topper from Alchemist. I had this on tap at the brewpub and was very eager to finally have gotten a chance to experience this beer. This beer is awesome in so many ways. First its great to see an east coast brewery making a super hoppy beer. The aroma is piney/citrusy hops that blast your face(but in a good way). The taste has a nice malt backbone to help let the hops shine but not destroy you. A really excellent beer from a great brewpub. 
Bottle consumed a few months back.
"Had on tap at the brewpub in Waterbury. I made the half hour trip to try this well reviewed beer and it mostly lived up to the hype. Nose was almost overwhelmingly floral, taste was well balanced between the hop and malt flavors compared to most IIPAs that I've sampled. Am looking forward to the cans to come later this year."
A: Golden straw colored with an unfiltered haze. 2-finger head and great lacing. Poured on-tap into a 12oz. glass.
"Thanks to Thorpe429 for supplying the bottle. Sampled just a couple weeks after bottling and poured into a Darkness snifter (being a glassware fanatic, I was quite envious when I noticed that Mike possessed the official Heady Topper glass, bastard, but very cool)"
"Thanks Sammy for getting this bottle into Ontario! Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Lots of lacing coats the side of my glass. Some hop floaties in the beer, which I think just adds to this. I can smell the hops before I even lift the glass off the table. Lots of resiny pine and citrus hops in the aroma. Very nice bitterness, but there seems to be a malt balance as well. This is certainly one of my favourites."
An exceptional IPA from John Kimmich in Waterbury. The heady is about perfect from start to finish. It's slightly cloudy just after pour. You can smell the floral aroma from about 1 foot away. Some IPA's can overpower with hops but this one is all about balance and subtly. They will be releasing the heady in cans late April. I hope they keep the same magic from the tap to the can.
Appearance: A hazy dark copper with whispy thin white lacing and a thin head.
"Very impressive DIPA. The hop aromas, very C-hop, are very satisfying and very fresh as if I am at the brewery now , as if hand bottled. Great lacing and head. Unfiltered look and taste, a full mouthfull. A little astringent. Grea carbonation. Bottle from Fred."
"Had on tap from a freshly tapped keg at the Alchemist Pub and Brewery in Waterbury, VT. Served in a 12 oz glass. "
"Bottle in trade with Glouglouburp. Thanks! Pours a hazy amber color with a big white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit hops. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Excellent citrus hop flavor with a nice malt balance and a nice bitter hop finish. Very similar to some west coast DIPAs I have had the pleasure to try. A very good beer."
got this one in a trade with freud. huge thanks man!
"Big thanks to baconsausage for shipping this towards the Arctic Circle along with a slate of other great beers. The IPA fiend in me has really been looking forward to this one. 22 oz. bottle split into two pint glasses, with the floaties & several ounces left for later potential rumination."
Wow. Thanks to Sideswipe for giving me this beer for free. Shared with my roomate pipmeister here on BA.
Split w/ bbb099. Thanks to scottfrie for this one! Consumed on 12/17/10.
"I've had Heady Topper many times at either the pub or the VT Brewers Fest. None of those occasions really allowed me to do a review. Recently, a friend moved to VT and got me a special release bottle of this wonderful beer."
At Kuhnhenn winter solstice (thanks to whomever shared this!)
Had on tap at the 12/4/10 bottle release at the Alchemist. Reviewing from notes.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you profusely to akorsak for sharing this great beer with me last night 1/9/11. Poured slightly cool into a cervoise glass."
"Enjoyed last night as the first in a multi beer tasting in a small (8-10oz) snifter, split with multiple friends, last couple ounces left in the bottle still had some hop flakes and yeasty dregs in it."
Reviewed from notes over Christmas break. Many thanks to the sister-in-law for making our Christmas amazing with this surprise under the tree!
"Got a bottle in trade from beerometer, enjoyed with Jwiss22, from my notes for once..."
Big thanks goes out to eggplantwiz for grabbing me this bottle. 
Had this on tap at the Alchemist about two months ago.
"Like the label says, drink fresh. The first bottle, enjoyed within 24 hours of release was a joy and virtually the same as on draft."
Thanks to Sean Lawson for the bottle.
Thanks to sisuspeed for this bottle.
Thanks to KristinCooks for this one in a trade! I'm enjoying this while pre-gaming for a Phish show - my first Heady Topper and my first Phish show... I'm officially a ... hippie?
"Better than Pliny, eh? We'll see."
"Bottle. Pours a light amber straw yellow color with a slight white head. Some sediment floating around. Danky type aroma of citrus and some pine type notes, some onion as well. Some lace. Medium mouthfeel. Slighlty sweet taste with a strong hop bitter flavor. Lingering bitterness. Does it live up to the hype? Hmm, it's decent but nothing that I think warrants the hype that it gets."
"Thanks Alex for sharing this one, you generous SOB. "
22oz. bottle re-reviewed. Thanks to Richard.
Thanks to Steve for sending this out. 
Pours a weak gold with tons of sediment and a dense head that lingers through the whole glass.
Completely unfiltered with tons of yeasty delicious sediment. An off copper translucent with a small white head.
Props to Masterhomebrewer for hooking me up with this in a trade!
"Bottle into my Narke tulip...Medium copper, not bright or sparkly enough for me. Tope head pretty good, looks good, nice retention and lacing...Aroma is really malty, lots of caramel, great to balance out the hops and alcohol. Hop presence is huge though, really good...The taste is also really malty, very different and unique for a dipa, but great to mask the hops and make it drinkable. Hops are more there in the feel."
"This is a great beer, and a gold mine for hop heads! Thanks to TCassel1 (Todd) for the trade for this!"
"Thanks to Alex for sharing this one, again. He had shared one with me before, but I was drunk and kept falling asleep and don't feel like a review based on that experience would do this justice."
Thanks to Kelp for hooking me up with a few bottles of this Vermont jewel! I have had this beer some years ago on tap at The Alchemist but that was before my reviewing days. Let's see how they did trying to capture the hop magic of this one in a bottle.
"Many thanks to a very generous BA for the opportunity to try this one, 22oz bomber."
"22oz bomber poured into snifter. Thanks goes to Alex for this one, you be da man. Been looking forward to this tick for a while. "
Poured from 500 ml bottle into a Heady Topper becker.
"I got 2 bottles of this courtesy of Kelp, thanks a ton Jeremy. I had a preview at the Kuhnhenn Winter Solstice too, so I was really looking forward to opening these."
Thanks to ubrewidrink and jedwards for the opportunity to try this bad boy.
Special thanks to Dreadnaught33 (aka. Jonathan) for bringing this beer to a tasting. I was really looking forward to this!
"Courtesy of mmtroop1218, much appreciated."
Bottle shared by Joe - thanks!
"My favorite beer hands down. My buddy and I compare every double ipa we have to this one ( and regular ipas to their holy cow) and we've found nothing that surpasses either of them. Hopefully their bottle run was a sneak preview. If they truly start canning, everyone outside of new england is in for a treat."
Thanks to masterhomebrewer to try this beer. I really wanted to compare it to PtY
"22oz bottle, huge thanks to nathanjohnson."
"Finally, the legendary Heady Topper arrives in California. Sent to me courtesy of rowingbrewer. Huge thanks Mark!"
"So excited that I got my hands on this. Pours a dark amber/orange with a frothy head and bubbles of all sizes. Good retention and some lacing. Smell is excellent, dominated by pink grapefruit, powerdy pine, and vines. Beautiful. Taste accomplishes what the bottle said was the goal: amazing complexity. Reminds me a bit of Mikkeller Ten in that you can find almost every hop flavor in the taste. Waves of different hops flow and ends with a biscuity malt finish, then hops linger for days in the aftertaste. Moderate bitterness but intense hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium-light bodied. Drinkability is ridiculous and I could have glass after glass, zero etoh."
Bottle shared with the dirty south crew!
"Bottle received in a trade with DNICE55. Thank you, David."
HUGE thanks to Brian for sending this my way!
Pours a slightly hazy copper-orange with a fingers worth of white foamy head on top. Leaves waves of lacing down the pint glass.
"Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass, revealing hazy caramel body under a few fingers of thick white head. Some lacing. Smells deliciously hoppy with an unctuous meaty caramel malt backbone. Lots of sweet honey floral smell. Holding up well post-release."
Poured from a bottle on 12/18/10 (bottle was acquired at the Dec. 4th Heady release).
A hazy gold with a frothy head and nice lacing
Had on tap the day of the 600 bottle release
Thanks to beerometer for making his first trade ever with such an awesome beer. Served in my Stone IPA glass.
Many thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing a bottle of this last night. What a treat.
Just received this brew tonight and CAN'T wait to try it!! I've heard so much about it from a jerky friend out in Connecticut. Now I get to try it! Drank from my Surly nonic pint glass.
"Thanks to both SneezyAchew and stowehop for bottles. Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Bottled 11/30/10, and consumed on 12/09/10."
"Huge thanks to bring for the bottle. Bottled on 11/30/2010, consumed 12/13/2010."
"First of all, a big thanks to Drazzamatazz who sent out this special beer. Cheers!"
"Chilled bottle into a glass. Thanks to the numerous Vermonters who showered me in offers of sending this: Drazzamatazz, iwantmorehops, youbrewidrink, and KristinCooks. There are some VERY generous people in that region. "
Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!
"22oz bottle poured into a perfect pint glass. Pours a murky golden burnt orange color. Smell is intensly piney with lots of pineapple, citrus and appricot. Taste is very similar to smell. Piney resin, fruit taste and a nice light malt backbone. Nicely carbonated giving a thick and lasting mouthfeel. Amazing beer. One of the best and most drinkable double IPAs. I cannot reccomend this one enough."
Out of a Hennepin tulip:
"Yes, that's right...bottled! Thanks to John and Co. for finally releasing this one. First tried this at the Cyclorama in Boston (EBF) when The Alchemist was just getting started and have had on tap at the source a handful of times. Very happy to have a friend bust out a bomber at a small gathering last night."
"Very happy I finally get to try this one, straight from the tap into my pilsner glass. Pours yellowish orange with a slight haze, small off white head with good retention and some nice lacing. As soon as this beer hits the table I can smell the hops. This is up there with some of the best smelling IPAs made. Pineapple, sweet malts, tropical fruit, not a hint of bitterness - just wonderful aroma hops. Taste is surprisingly different from the smell, and this isnt a bad thing. Pineapple and tropical fruit flavor but with a bit more bitterness then I was expecting, some biscuit malt (not a lot, just enough to provide balance), a slightly spicy, earthy hop finish. The lighter side of medium body with a medium light carbonation, finishes very clean. This is an excellent IPA and hands down the best one to come from anywhere east of California. Very different then the west coasters in terms of flavor, but much smoother and more drinkable then Pliny or some of the other notables. I wanted to try everything at the Alchemist and this was my first, and then my second beer. Wish I could drink this every night."
"Bottle shared by Thorpe429, thanks Mike. This IPA has gotten so much buzz in the past year, it quickly became my biggest beer ambition to get some, after having some of the bottle last night, it remains one of my biggest wants. I have to make it up to the alchemist the next time this is on tap."
"22 oz. bottle courtesy of the generous masterhomebrewer - thanks, buddy! I wanted to consume this one as quickly as possible, so that it would be as fresh as possible (as is encouraged by the brewmaster on the excellently written label). Poured in to a large tulip."
Big thanks to rpstevens for the bottle in Secret Santa '10.
Thanks a lot to baconsausage for sending me this great brew!
Thanks sleepydave for sending me this bottle!
Bottle thanks to Drazzamatazz.
Sharing a bottle of this with mymrnngjckt. Really looking forward to this...
Thanks for sharing this one drew
Huge thanks to Sisuspeed for sending this my way in a recent trade! The bomber was split with a friend and poured into two snifters.
"I cannot believe that this beer is in front of me. I've dreamed about it forever. In fact, I've even considered making a trip out to Vermont simply to try it. Thanks, glazeman, and thanks to the trader that got this one done for him, and thanks to the trader that hooked me up with Matt in order to reel in the infamous Heady Topper."
22oz bottle received in a trade with rowingbrewer. Poured into a Bruery tulip.
"22 oz bottle, big thanks to grub for sharing!"
"12/11/2010. Thanks to Murchmac. Bottle. Enjoyable beer but lacking any real bitter bite and not quite as loaded down with hops as I prefer. The beer pours a cloudy, tawny orange-amber with a white head. A very nice sweet citrus and tropical fruit tone dominates the aroma. It's almost entirely tangerine rind, mangoes and guava. There's a hint of pine lurking in the background. However, it's not quite as pungent as the best of the style. Surprisingly, the taste lacks nearly any assertive bitterness. There's a bit of grapefruit pith in the finish, but this is one of the least bitter DIPAs that I've ever tasted. That said, it's also not overly malty or particularly sweet. It just sorta lacks a strong taste note. The thin body and utter lack of hop oiliness in the mouthfeel emphasized this problem for me. It does have a nice hoppy aftertaste. It was an enjoyable beer to drink and it went down easily enough, but, ultimately, I found the beer rather disappointing. The taste fails to deliver on the promise of the smell. I'm happy to have tried it, but I don't really understand the hype. 4/4.5/3.5/3/4"
"Thanks for sharing this one, Drew."
Really nice of Rpstevens to send me a bottle of this. I owe him.
"Consumed December 8th, Bottled November 30th. Thanks to BA member gamanley for picking up the bottle for me."
"A - pours a good orange color with very few bottles, and miniscule what head that quickly fades away. not bad, but unimpressive."
Here's one I never thought I'd be drinking. 22oz thanks to Drazzamatazz. I owe you big time. Poured into oversized tulip. 
Pours a very murky copper/orange color with a finger of thick head and good lacing.
"Damn, this is hoppy. That's about my first impression immediately upon popping the cap off of this. With that, I should say huge, huge thanks to rpstevens and kingcrowing for sending me bottles of this, the latter of which was a complete surprise. One bottle to be consumed tonight, the other to be shared with friends this weekend."
Poured from a bottle from the release last weekend obtained via trade (thanks Dave for getting it to me super fresh)
22oz bottle acquired from the release in VT
Thanks to Jon!!! For sending this out less than 36 hours after I sent him a message about it. Crazy. And consumed less than 48 hours after. 
A: Hazy golden pour with stick off-white foam. I want to rate this higher but only I can smell this beer right off the bat and it's subconsciously influencing me.
"Poured from a bottle into a Heady Topper pint glass. The beer pours a hazy copper/orange that glows brightly when held up to the light. The pour produces a one finger bone white head that quickly fades to a tight ring, leaving some oily lacing on the walls of the glass."
"I've reviewed the tap and cask version of this beer. I wanted to try a fresh bottle so I cracked one open tonight on taco night and split it with the wife 12-6-10. There is nothing like an ipa fresh on tap. This beer still amazing. Didn't loose anything on taste, smell, or appearance. Not quite as crisp as on tap which effects only the mouthfeel and drinkability ever so slightly. What an exceptional beer."
"This review is long overdue, I have been drinking this beer since the beginning."
"Having not logged into BA for the past few months, I've managed to miss the hype of Heady Topper. I went to the release with lpayette just for the heck of it and got to try the beer... so I imagine this review is pretty hype-free."
"On tap at The Alchemist on the release date, 12/4/10. Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass."
On tap @ The Alchemist..
A: pours an orangeish hazy color witha finger high head that leaves an amazing lacing
"Drank on-tap at The Alchemist, Waterbury, VT"
Had on tap at the brewery this past Thursday. I do not normally give out 5's but I must say this is quite honestly the tastiest beer I have ever had. 
Had this on cask tonight at the Alchemist with beerloco who is now snoring like a maniac on a motel room floor because the stupid owner gave our room with 2 beds away to somebody else...note he is passed out while I'm currently drinking a Foothills Baltic Porter :)
From 08/28/10 notes. Had on tap at the Alchemist on my trip up to Vermont. Review number 600!
"It's a slightly cloudy.gold beauty, topped by 2 fingers of pure white head. Crazy lace on the glass."
"A- Opaque apricot, very little head but it might be the pour. Kind of looks like a hefeweizen. Web like lacing. Okay. "
I'm very glad I kept tabs on the reviews for Heady Topper so I knew when it was available again. A nearly 3-hour trip to the brewpub on a Sunday...
"Hunted the Heady Topper, found out it was on tap, 2.75 hours and $4 later..."
"Was lucky to have a weekend trip up to Stowe, VT planned when Heady was tapped. Settled in for two."
"Finally made the long trek up here to be able to taste it in person. Reviewed from notes after my trip, I am finally getting around to getting these all caught up. Served in a pint glass."
"A- pours a hazy golden color with a one finger white head which recedes into chunky, nearly opaque lacing on the glass."
"My new favorite DIPA, if not my new favorite beer overall right now! Extremely lucky to have been in VT while this was tapped. Enjoyed multiple times after SIPtemberfest with BeerTruth on 9/26/09. Unfortunately, the cask was already gone."
So I am with my girlfriend and her mom touring around Vermont. We try to go to harpoon but it is closed on Mondays. Bummer. BA on the cell phone. This place looks good. GPS's timer is off by an hour. Sounds good let's make a trip of it.
"My last bier of the night (16APR09) with dinner... The Holey Moley having kicked, this was the one to satisfy my hop habit..."
"I had heard so much about this beer I finally decided I had to drive south to check it out. Off the tap it was a deep gold color leaning towards amber with some of its hues. The head was two-fingers thick, playground-sand-colored, displayed great retention as a perfectly tight cap and left consistent bands of thin lacing. The aroma was big and spicy, full of aggressive hops and a musty quality almost like armpit odor. I know that sounds awful but I was blown away by how much smell was emitting from this beer. The flavors were equally huge. A deep hop profile of pine, grapefruit and kumquat with some white pepper and similar spiciness was balanced nicely by the malt sweetness of toffee and butterscotch. The finish was again hoppy with edgy notes of bitter resin and some lemon zest. It was almost like a wet-hopped beer with the drinkability of good American Brown Ale because the alcohol was so well hidden. The mouthfeel was very smooth but the carbonation gave the right amount of 'fill' to its medium body. One of the best Vermont beers I have ever had and one of the best Imperial/Double IPAs I've ever come across."
"Quite simply, it's the best beer I've ever had. I was privileged to be one of the first to try Heady Topper when it was introduced at the Vermont Brewer's Festival quite a few years back. After sampling about a dozen wonderful microbrews (in 3oz samples mind you, so I was still an objective critic), I stopped by the Alchemist tent & tried this new concoction."
"The Alchemist: Heady Topper, IIPA (Tasted 11/28/08)"
"This beer poured a beautiful orange-blond color with lots of foam. Not the first cask ale I've had though. The aroma was strong and hoppy with hints of citrus. The taste started out strong and hoppy and faded into a nice citrusy bitterness. Well balanced for a DIPA and as their description says, very drinkable. Packs a wallop at 140IBUs."
Had this on tap at the pub in early October.
"Had more than one of these during our visit to the brewpub. Nice and orangey amber, I dove right in and picked up on an intriguing woody-earthy character in the aroma. There was also a nice new mown hay essence and candied hoppyness as well. That is a lot of excitement to live up to, but luckily, the beer delivered all of this in the taste as well. The earthiness was also pretty present in the finish. This is an excellent double IPA which will keep you ordering more. I can't say any more than that even at 8% abv...I still wanted to keep drinking. No taste fatigue or wobbliness in the legs after one. Nice beer."
"Had this bad boy more than once at the brewer's fest, but was salivating when I saw they had it on cask at the pub."
"Appears a cloudy golden amber...looks unfiltered and super appealing with a frothy, bubbly 1 finger white head that lasts. Tons of huge, chunky bubbly lace...uhhhh, WOW."
On tap this past weekend.
"Was able to go over to the Alchemist yesterday while up in VT doing some snowshoeing. Was able to stop in and try the Heady Hopper, which I have heard great things about. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The pint was poured to medium golden yellow color, was somewhat cloudy and had a nice sized white head that leaves very nice, thick lacing down the entire glass. The aroma was incredible, hops all the way! When it was served all I could smell was cascade hop aroma and I was three feet away from the glass! The flavors of this brew explode in the mouth from the hops, citrus grapefruit and oranges just dominate, while you are still able to pick up the malt but it was hard and it also disappeared quite quickly! I am not sure if I have had anything else that states that it has 120 IBUs but the hop bite was not unbearable, I am not sure if there is a level where IBUs dont really matter anymore but all I can say is that this brew was excellent, lived up to the hype and expectation. I honestly can say it may be one of my favorite brews of all time and by far was the best one experienced on this trip through Vermont."
"In my opinion, this might be the most drinkable double IPA I have ever had! Color is a nice golden hue, and then the aroma... oh, the aroma. Heady Topper STINKS of cascade, I love it! Goes down really smooth, hoppy, but not too hoppy, totally balanced. I look forward to trying more beers by the Alchemist."
Enjoyed at the brewpub.
"On tap at the Alchemist brewpub in Waterbury, VT. Damn, 8% ABV and 120 IBU's, but totally smooth and tasty. Amber color with a low white bubbly head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Smooth and even mouthfeel leads to an intense flavor of pineapple and orange peel hops with a hint of peaches. The ABV is subtle and not overpowering at all. A fine web of lacing dances around the inside of the glass. The flavor is consistent throughout the entire glass. This one is real tasty and I ripped through it because I couldn't stand the thought of it not rolling over my taste buds for more than a few seconds."
"Served a pale amber with a small light head. Hops are the flavor of choice here, but they are done right. Such a yummy bite. Actually does live up to it's name as the hops are strong enough to give off the heady within the buzz. Hops are not overly complex, yet not too simple either. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Served only in 12oz glasses, the abv is not at all apparent. Sooo smooth. I'm sad that El Jefe is no longer on the menu, but I'd take the Heady Topper over the chief anyday."
"16oz can. Pours a turbid pale orangey yellow with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, lime and orange. Some dank notes as well. The taste is pineapple and tangerine along with dank hops. Orange pineapple juice at the end with some resinous pine and a hint of toasted malts. Creamy with a dry mouthfeel. Fantastic Double IPA worth seeking out."
Typical treehouse ipa greatness. Fruits hop aromas on the nose with that soft pillowy mouth feel that we all love from Treehouse. Fruit aromas are completely backed up on the palate as well
"Whoa, this is incredible; traditional Green pine, but it takes the juiciness, creaminess, and fruitiness I associate with Julius and puts it up front and center; flavorful, superb body, and just dope."
Probably the best beer I’ve had recently.
"Born-on date: 8/17/18 (with a reference to the Queen of Soul stamped on the bottom of the can); consumed on 9/6/18, so this one is 20 days old."
"Golden pour, sap and resin in the taste. Very drinkable. Even balance of carbonation and definitely worth a trip to the brewery to try this beverage."
2018-08-26
"A little too ""big"" for my tastes, but compared to other Imperial IPAs this is a gem. Very complex with a citrusy bitterness, it's tough to get your hands on but if you have the chance I highly recommend giving this one a try."
Amazing beer....
16 oz into tulip.
"Wow, pour this puppy into a snifter and it smells like a weed dispensary. A dank nose that is incredibly fresh and hoppy. Lots of tropical fruit, fresh wet citrus hops, herbs and marijuana."
After going back to this beer the three separate times I have been able to get it I believe it is the best beer I have ever had!
Can thanks to eric
"This one pours as very hazy and murky orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Picked-up two cans (limit) at the Tree House Brewery last week for $5.05. Wow, this beer really impressed. One of the best beers I have ever had, but have to ping it a bit for the price (= $120/case)."
"Pale golden orange and opaque, with a finger or two of white head that trails some lace lines down the glass... Wow... Tropical and citrus notes on the nose preview a real killer beer - manages to be juicy at the same time its taut, its lush but also green, plush but also bitter... Doesn't go full fruit smoothie on you, maintaining a tight grip the sugars... Tangy and zesty, with impressions of bright green limes, dry grapefruit pith, and succulent pineapple and orange... Finishes with a subtle dank pine shellac to round things off... Leapt right to the top of my list... 6/8/18 canning..."
"16oz can shared by Tim, thanks brother!"
"L: Love the way it looks in the glass. Pale yellow with burnt orange highlights. While its murky it doesn't look muddy, if that makes sense. The ""haze"" is incredibly solid, almost looks like a candle wax in the glass. Originally poured a 2 finger head but that settled out to a film. Lots of lacing on the glass"
"Can from the brewery dated 6/8/18. Looks like a dirty mimosa milkshake. Smell is lovely, pineapple. Nice, lingering head, and excellent lacing. "
One of the finest IPAs I’ve ever tasted. Great aroma with complete juice taste. Amazing silk smoothness with very little bitterness
The best you will ever taste - or at least best I have ever had from TH so far. incredible all the way around
"I've been really enjoying IPAs with galaxy hops recently, and I've been a fan of Green since I first tried it. This ranks among the best IPAs I have ever experienced. Thank you, Nate!"
"Smell: Pink Bubblegum, fresh chunky pineapple, mango, papaya, some sweet bready malt. This smells just like green with more of that bubblegum quality, which means this smells mesmerizing, it’s awesome and has my mouth salivating."
Like Julius had an alcoholic brother
A- Floury and murky golden-yellow brew out of the can into my glass. The cap that forms is white with a thick and creamy texture and great retention. Tons of lacing webs and sheets drape the glass after sipping.
A: cloudy; medium gold; 1 finger white head that receded to a thin cap; very nice lacing;
Beautiful hazy NE IPA with elegant lacing while drinking. Citrus and hops aroma greets you as you pop the top and complements the crisp hoppy flavor. High in ABV but extremely drinkable IPA. Velvety is truly how if feels in your mouth. One of the best beers I have ever d(r)ank.
Murky straw colo -r check
"Almost 2 weeks old. Nose leaves a little to be desired, but the taste and mouthfeel and taste are incredible. This is really a special beer. I'm glad I was able to snag one"
Crack open the can and be ready to make involuntary happy noises.
L - Milkshake body and light orange in color with a finger of white head
"Damn near perfect beer. Unbelievably tropical, soft, and dank."
"Canned on 4/17/18 opened on 4/21/18. "" it's sooooo supple!!"" 8.3 % abv."
Joey from “Blossom”: whooooaa
Good. Picked up an earthy flavor. For all the hype and high expectations im a bit disappointed. Not my top Tree house beer but very good. Everyone has different tastes ya know
"Poured from a 16 ounce can that's right at two weeks old. Pours a hazy tangerine color with about two fingers of soft white head. Smell is very juicy. Hard to pick out any one fruit, but for this beer, that's not a bad thing. Taste matches the smell, as I get some tangerine and a bit of mango. Medium feel with just a touch of malt on the back. A very nice beer that I was glad to get to try."
"Very good beer, not my favorite from tree house but in my top 5. Pale looking body with haze, pine is dominate hop flavor but still has significant biscuit and caramel. Very very good, worth seeking out only if your favorite style is IPA"
On tap at brewery.
"Incredible incredible beer. Takes all the things that are great about Green and amplifies them. Has a little less hop bite than the single IPA version, in my opinion... but can't wait to try this one again."
"Edit: had this again today, and I definitely like it more. Still preferred Perm 32, but this is excellent. "
Canned 4 days ago and tried alongside a 3-day-old can of Green. 
"A - One finger of foamy, extremely active white head. Minimal retention, but good lacing. Body is turbid with minimal light penetration - color of canned pineapple juice."
Yummy!
Potentially thicker than some shakes I’ve had over the years. Study in subtlety on the nose with layers of honey and pineapple. Faint yellow/pineapple juice in color. Earthy straw grass pineapple guava taste no true bitter element presents itself
"Hazy, golden yellow, good frothy head, thin lace."
Very Green served in a Tree House teku.
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy citrus. Taste is a very strong hoppy grapefruit citrus taste that is amazing.
"Pours a murky, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam on top. Head retention is good, with good lacing left behind. Aroma is a sharp hit of papaya, mango, grapefruit, and orange zest. Lovely depth, although it focuses and centers on a single dimension - citrus hop notes. Flavor profile is mango, papaya, grapefruit, and orange and lemon zest. There is a slight dank, and pine hop note in the finish of the flavor profile. Very Green starts off semi-sweet, and finishes just a touch bitter. There isn't much difference between the sweet start or the bitter finish, just a subtle shift in dynamics. Malts are well hidden, but hit notes of biscuit and bread. Mouth feel is a bit fizzy, and grainy, giving this beer a more velvety feel, as opposed to a crisp, or even a juice-like feel. It has a medium thickness. Overall, loads of citrus notes in the aroma and flavor profile. It comes off a touch more full in the flavor and feel than it's single IPA (Green) sibling, with a notable bump in aromatics. "
"unfortunately this recent batch was a disappointment---still tasty, but not near what it was the last batch!"
"Pours about as hazy as anything I’ve ever seen before with a frothy white head on top. The smell of the beer has a very good amount of fruity hop aroma coming off of it. The taste is nicely balanced between sweet and hoppy, but virtually no bitterness to it at all. The feel is creamy and smooth. Goes down similar to a milkshake. Overall I think It’s a great beer and glad I was able to finally try it."
Sampling a cold can poured into a snifter date stamp is 01/05/2018. Thanks for picking these up for me Erik!
One of the best IPAs I've had recently.
Look: Yellow hazy with big fluffy white head.
"16oz can, 6 days old. Served in a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy, hazy golden orange body, two finger thick white head, lots of splotchy lacing and good retention. Smell is juicy tropical fruit, orange, a bit of zest, Nelson-like spicy tropical aromas, mild caramel. The tropical fruit is pronounced here as expected, and this certainly bursts with hops. I had a one week old can of Green yesterday and in comparison, this is a bit more lively and aromatic. Flavour is similarly a bit more lively; lots of tropical fruit and citrus, with a slightly pulpy grapefruit zest, spice, touch of caramel to keep a reasonable balance, light leafy resin and a nice spice on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy with perfect carbonation, smooth with a slight spice and mild leafy resinous bitterness on the backend. Very good beer, although I cannot in good conscience say it is significantly better than Green, which is already one of the best New England style IPAs one can obtain."
Canned 1/5/18; drank 1/11/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"Pours out beautiful as you would expect, murky yellowish in color with a dense and creamy bright white head "
"From a 16oz can, dated 01/05/18... 'calculating infinity.' What does that even mean? Never mind. Served in my favourite imperial pint pub glass."
"Just delicious, smooth, hoppy, juicy, delicious"
Bombogenesis in a can!
"This may be the best beer I've ever had. Lots of tropical fruit up front, dank bitterness to finish, really well balanced throughout. Felt like I nearly got frostbite on my nose waiting in line for an hour on a frigid Friday evening for it, Totally worth it."
"Incredible, but I'll take regular green over it. The hops are more powerful, everything is ramped up. but with that came an additional residual sweetness that I don't particularly think the base beer needed. Still amazing though, and very lucky to have been able to try it at the last release in Monson."
"Two cans from Monson. Green on steroids, with plenty of head and pineapple."
On of the best beers Ive had period
"This is the pinnacle of NE IPAs. Hazy, dank, hoppy, looks like a straw-colored milkshake in a glass. Green was already one of my favorite beers and this things just kicks the door down. Get it if you can."
One of my all time favs. TH did this one right
"Best beer in the country, hands down! Complete miracle they didn't sell out before I got there! If you had Green, this blows it's doors off and Green is my favorite beer out of Tree House!"
Th
"Well, I recently got some of TH big beers including this one. Being its the oldest I drank it first and if JM and VH are as good or better than this one OMG. Just as I expected - so smooth and full of flavor. A classic TH Juice bomb. Its unreal how they just keep coming out with these amaze balls beers. All I can say is Wow !"
Good beer. Maybe my taste buds have been ruined by alll the other great new england IPAs. I tasted it side by side with a Green and found the biggest difference was the the bite. This was slightly smoother than standard green.
Green on green on green on green on green
"Can poured into snifter. Hazy, murky golden yellow color. Modest carbonation. The fruits to the nose are awesome and the taste is similar to Juice Machine. TH knows how to brew great beers!"
"It was... very orange. Exceptionally balanced with a proper bitter note, unlike some other Tree House brews. It's definitely special- the hop character really shines through."
"This is incredible. Lots of pineapple in the taste, so juicy. Its sort of a thick mouth feel but in a good way. It got even better as it warmed in the glass."
A: Poured into a TH Teku glass a hazed up oat white mango juice / blended looking with a very foamy head that appeared sturdy at first pour. 
Acquired in trade.
"Pours a very turbid bright straw yellow. The nose is bright and fresh, full of citrus and ripe tropical fruits. Taste of fresh citrus, grapefruit, orange, light lime, Mango and minimal pinnaple. Medium body and very smooth on the palate. Finishes with a somewhat dry citrus pith like bitter snap. Good beer"
"Clear yellow, thin head, good lacing. Hay, bread crust, banana, coriander. Medium body, soft carbonation. Strange beer, but very good."
A 16 oz can dated 3/17/17 poured into a TH teku glass. 
"Canned 03/17/17, so just under one week."
"This is an incredible beer. Pours Hazy and bright. Smell is EXPLOSIVELY tropical, taste follows it. Hardly any bitterness on the back end. Its just , so so so god damn good."
"So, I did a side by side comparison of Green and Very Green. I expected a typically IPA versus the DIPA version, and man was I wrong. I first noticed they were almost the same in ABV, Very Green being a hair higher. So, that noted, I expected a HOP monster of Very Green. Very Green looked very similar in color to Green, but Green had a piney hop bite, whereas Very Green was smooth! The hop was still there, but it was never bitter. Just super smooth and crisp! What a pleasant surprise and a great take on a DIPA!"
Look: super hazy golden yellow thick creamy 1.5 inch head
"Super hazy golden color, tall white head and great lacing. Citrus, pineapple and dank hop aroma. Notes of pineapple, orange juice, grapefruit rinds, dank hop resin and ruby red grapefruit pulp. Slick, creamy, medium, and drying. Full on hop assault that builds on ever sip, tons of depth and complexity. This is a fantastic beer to have tried."
As with just about every single brew from Tree House - the look is spectacular.
"Poured into a teku glass. Extremely hazy straw color with a white head that stays nicely. Pineapple, citrus and mango on the nose, with some hop notes in the background. Tropical fruit flavored- the taste definitely follows the nose, with some tart grapefruit and some earthiness. Creamy mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. Definitely lives up to the hype."
"Cloudy yellow color with pleasant carbonation. Delicious nose of pineapple, mango and malt. Marvelous viscous mouthfeel with more pineapple and a balanced bitterness throughout. A nice long finish. A bit more pleasant funkiness than its Cousin Julius."
12/30 batch. Drank today 1/22.
"This is definitely one of the best IPA's that Treehouse makes (of the ones that I've tried so far at least). The aroma and the taste are simply breathtaking, you'll have to try it to know what I'm talking about."
Can from the brewery.
"By for the most disappointing beer at our share. Everyone agreed there was no ""very"" to be found and that there wasnt notable difference between the th cans we tried (dopleganger, supersap, c29)."
"Honestly, I do not understand how almost everything tree house touches turns to gold. World class. Looks incredibly hazy, almost murky. Smells super dank with a complex tropical bloom. Pineapples for days. Feels like a symphony playing on your palate with so many different movements. This beer is transcendental. Buy it if you can."
Had a pour of this during one of Tree House's special one day permits and it was fantastic.
"Pours merky orange with a nice head. Nice lacing. Aroma citrus and pineapple. Taste follows the nose with pine needles, danky middle but not overpowering at all, gram crackers,citrus with earthy tone finish. Mouth feel is velvety. Another great one from tree house"
"Opaque pineapple juice with a large, dense, off-white foamy head settling to a souffle appearance."
"From a can dated 12-30-16. The usual Tree House IPA/DIPA opaque fruit juice color with ample carbonation. I see it and I start to slobber, knowing something tasty is coming. Nose isn't explosive right out of the can as a a few of the other premier TH offerings, but plenty of pineapple and other tropical fruit as it warms and when it delivers, the slobbering starts again. Taste - a little of everything - pine, citrus, tropical and a hint of dank - and yet it works perfectly. Mouth feel? In my opinion, the one thing that TH still does better than anyone -- and this is no exception."
"16oz can, purchased from the brewery. "
"Poured into an IPA glass. A turbid golden-yellow color with a foamy bright white head that very slowly settled, leaving thick laces. Complex nose with bright pineapple, dank resin, pine, orange, and white bread. I taste the dank resin up front, followed by the earthy notes and finally the juicy citrus on the back palate. Pineapple and orange on the finish, with a ringing bitterness. Moderately carbed with a creamy mouthfeel as billed. World-class."
"If you've ever had a Tree House beer, you know what to expect from the appearance. Very few beers are truly opaque; this is one of them. Head formation and retention are both strong, with a nearly snow-white appearance atop a cloudy peach body."
Canned 01-14-16. Drank 01-23-16.
16oz. can into a Heady Topper stemless snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
I feel like this is one of those beers where many reviewers conflate its exclusivity with the actual taste. I think it's something that the Alchemist beers suffer from as well. By no means is this a bad beer but I don't think it lives up to the hype. I got it as fresh as can be considering they were literally being canned as they were being sold
"Can shared by jc1762. Thanks so much, Jon. One of my top wants."
Great beer!
"My new favorite beer. Loved everything about green, and while flavors obviously punch more, it's still balanced."
"Perhaps too old. Not sure. But this didn't floor me. The aroma a bit restrained and the flavor disjointed some pineapple and slightly sour citrus (bitter orange?) up front, then a micro-burst of bitter, but this finishing flat wet barley + carboard note that disrupted any reveries. Far from my favorite treehouse. Lacking brightness and definition which is often the flaw of these beers that go for too much haze and fruit. Their center of gravity is sensitive to small fluctuations in balance. "
"This can was a month + old, so not in prime shape. Still the appearance and aroma were on point, hazy golden/orange beautiful with great head retention and lacing, followed up with a big juicy aroma of overripe peach, mango, guava, and pineapple. Some passion fruit as well."
"One of the only Tree House IPAs I hadn't previously had. Like most TH IPAs, I prefer the regular version. Smell on this is amazing, though, bright citrusy lime. It's great, but I still prefer Green for it's less bitter, creamier finish."
"My 100th rated beer on BA! Pours super a super hazy yellow orange color. Notes of candied pear, apples, and a very slight piney citrus undertone. The taste is surprisingly dry and not all that juicy especially when compared to regular green. Most of the flavor comes on the back end with a very bitter piney bite. Leaves a classic IPA bitter resiny aftertaste. The feel is a tad light though there is still a touch of that shaky quality from the particulates in the beer (though not as much as the other beers). Overall I think this is a very good beer but is too bitter for my own taste as the reason I enjoy me IPAs is because they not all that bitter. I can see how a true hop head would go crazy for this as it has juicy elements but still has that bitter resiny back end of the vast majority of IPAs."
This is so damn good. I held on to this for about six weeks before drinking and it was fantastic. I cannot imagine that it lost anything. Possibly the finest IPA that I've ever had.
Absolutely incredible. This will be one I continue to search for.
"L - Hazy grapefruit color, minimal head"
Like Green on steroids as one would suspect. Seek it out.
"How do you give something like this anything other than a perfect score? Beautiful orange, very opaque appearance with silky, feather-like lacy foam. Citrus fruit, tropical notes of mango, pineapple, guava… it's all there beating up the nose. The taste just follows that smell with Citra + Mosaic hops shining through. Not sure anyone has made this combo better. It's like regular Green on steroids. Mouthfeel is ridiculously full, creamy and full of flavor. This DIPA aftertaste lingers with each sip,… something you expect from stouts really, yet super easy to drink. Could down 6 of these without realizing it."
Was a bit disappointed in the taste with this one relative to their others. More bitter than some of their others. Nose and mouth feel are amazing as usual
"First time going to tree house and this was there waiting for me, I have never had green but this beer is so amazing. Juicy is not enough not enough to describe this beer but it leaves you like wow and then where did it go because you drink it so fast,"
Drank from a 1 pint can
Great beer from Tree House. I've got to try this finally. Super Hoppy but super smooth. Smells perfect like green but so much smoother but stronger. Amazing taste.
"thank you robbie for the share, can from 2 days ago....love is in the air. wow, truth in advertising...this is green, but very much so. green times two...maybe three? yum yum."
Look - perfect cloudy orangy color
"Straw/apricot in color with a thick, foamy head. Head is very slightly yellow, nice bubbly lacing. Smell is slight mango and a lot of citrus, some citrus peel. Taste is also strong citrus, mild tropical sweetness, not as juicy as other Tree House beers - more dry on the finish, with a slight biscuit aftertaste and very mild bitterness. Soft carbonation. Delicious, a definite favorite."
"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color, with 1/4 inch head. Taste is huge pineapple and pineapple juice with light mango, and slight tangerine. Amazing beer..Much like Green it is a lot softer and subtle than other Tree House brews. Nuanced, light bodied, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter and ohhh so juicy. Just an amazing beer. I can only hope this one ages as beautifully as regular Green does. Glad I was able to catch this whale...It kicked five before me the last time I was at Tree House. Will go up again for this. Right up there with the best of Tree House's amazing brews."
Appearance is hazy straw with minimal head and minimal lacing. 
"The most drinkable 8%+ IIPA I've ever had. Pours unfiltered hazy goodness. Amazing mouthfeel--smooth juicy hop bomb. The first ""very"" I've tried from Treehouse (have had juicemachine & king Julius) and it did not disappoint. Ranks #1 in my treehouse try's."
Pours a hazy orange straw color with a gigantic fluffy white head. Nice retention and lacing as the head dissipates.
Tree House Very Green
Hazy golden orange. 
"Poured from 750ml growler. Typical haze of TH. This topped the TH and Trillium beers I had on my NE trip in August and is on short list of best in US i've had. So much complexity and best mouthfeel of any IPA or DIPA that I've had. Pine, some citrus and dank."
Can't go wrong with anything TH. I don't think I've had an off batch of anything they've made since I started going two years ago. Very green is an exploding of dank juicy goodness.
"Perhaps my can was a bit old, but I was expecting a lot more. I love Green and was expecting this to kick Green up the way Very Hazy kicked up Haze. It was very good but I did not feel it was up to billing. Could be because I had this after Jjjulisss. I will need to try it again"
"Extremely hazy yellow color with a bit of white head. Aroma has lots of hops, tropical, juicy, dank, everything you could ask from an IPA. Taste follows with the same juicy hop flavors but also a good amount of bitterness. Aftertaste lingers with grapefruit pith. Medium body with smooth carbonation. This one is probably the best hoppy beer I ever had."
Poured from a 750mL growler into a Treehouse snifter. Purchased at the brewery during the release last weekend. 
"Deep opaque orange with foamy heady and moderate lacing. In your face type Pineapple, mango, fruit cocktail, and clementine on the nose and palate. The nose lasts throughout the entire beer ... Amazing. Full mouthfeel. One of my top favorite Tree House beers. Thanks Dan for the trade!"
fresh can drank in a teku on 8/7/2016
Purchased growler on 04Aug 2016 and imbibed 05Aug2016. Poured into Duvel tulip. 
Canned 7/29. Consumed 8/4.
"This is excellent. A little more boozy than Green, which I prefer a touch more. All the Treehouse little brother beers are cleaner and more balanced I think. That's a small quibble because Treehouse is consistently proving no one makes better hoppy beers."
"This beer really backs up the hype. Classic Tree House haze. Mango, citrus, tropical aroma. Taste begins with a tropical hop punch, then changes to a little resin/pine before finishing with a slight malt smoothness. The beer feels buttery smooth. Go find it!"
Overhyped for what it is. That being said this beer is really good and IMO should be drank fresh.
"Thick, turbid, creamy yellow-tan color with a fluffy white head. Under the right light, it glows orange. Smell jumps of mango, passion fruit, and mild pineapple. The taste is a wonderful punch of galaxy hop flavor, with a great punch of tropical fruitiness. As the beer warms, it is supported by some of the purest hoppy fruit juice flavors I have ever detected in a beer. Just pure orange and mango riding below more traditional citrusy and mildly bitter hop flavors. The feel is thick and lush; feels like it is saturated with flavors that slowly melt in your mouth. I imagine if sipping this beer through a straw, you'd have to pull harder as if drinking a milkshake. My tastes are preferential to galaxy hopped offerings, Green being one of my favorites, and this one tops them all."
"Everyone is ga-ga over this beer, I thought it (like Green) was out of balance. Tropical fruit and piney notes... like it needed to sit and mellow a couple weeks before opening. I'll try it again if offered, but I'm not spending $4 on it unless I'm in the mood to have it sit in the fridge a couple weeks before I drink it."
"Green on drugs. Perhaps the best Treehouse IPA IMO. This takes Green and adds the right things to push it from top five IPAs offered by Treehouse and adds just the right things to make it exceptional. Could be the best beer I've ever had, with only Very Hazy being a real competitor. Simply an amazing brew."
"I've only had this one time, at the Tree House 3rd Anniversary party, and was a bit letdown...Green is my favorite IPA, period, and I kinda thought/hoped this would do for Green what King Julius does for Julius...that next level effect...I've heard that the batch 2 years ago was extraordinary, and I've heard that the most recent batch that was canned was amazing....so I look forward to trying it again."
"I did a side-by-side with a can of regular Green, and found them to be more similar than I thought they'd be. Of course Very Green edged it out, it's pineapple nose wallops you as soon as you crack open the can; but Green is so amazing on it's own, it is difficult to improve much on something that's already so delicious."
"Pours a very cloudy orange honey color. Aroma is big citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is juicy citrus, tropical fruit and has a great hoppy aftertaste. Great body and very delicious overall."
"Poured from a can into a teku. Beautiful turbid look, a little less on the nose than expected but an amped-up, slightly more bitter than Green taste along with the typical TH mouthfeel made up for it. Another great TH offering but not substantially better than Green."
"Dank hops & orange rind. Tropical notes are dominant as pithy citrus overshadows any malt presence. I love “Green” but this surpasses. Easily my favorite of the ""big brothers"""
Look: like green just a shade on the darker side.
16 ounce can poured into a snifter.
Can into tulip. Return of the dank. 1/14/16
Another excellent Treehouse offering! This one looked like OJ with a nice light orange hue and was full of plenty of delicious dank citrus hops! Glad I tracked it down!
"16 oz can. Pours super cloudy orange-apricot, thick fluffy head that slowly fades leaving coating lace. Big juicy citrus peel aroma with hint of dank weed. Taste is juicy but not as sweet juicy as the other TH IPAs. This one has some dank earthy piney weed notes that come in strong and last awhile for near perfect bitter semi dry finish. Full creamy soft mouthfeel. This brew is outstanding, don't want it to end."
"One of the best tasting IPAs I've ever had... Juicy but not sweet. Mouthfeel and look typical of treehouse, if not on the exaggerated end of each."
"Green is already just about my favorite beer period, so I was really looking forward to trying this one. It's more tropical fruits, stronger concentration of the flavors you find in Green, but despite being a DIPA, it somehow drinks even smoother. It doesn't have that hoppy bite on the back end that Green does, but that's not necessarily a bad thing"
"Pours a thick, hazy orangish color almost like orange juice. Nice foamy head. Smells of tropical pineapple, and mango with notes of oranges. Taste is sweet up front with a nice balance from the malts and a mildly bitter finish. Another winner."
"drinking side by side comparing to green. smell stronger w more pungent tropical fruit flavors. amazing. slightly darker and more opaque than green. taste is right off the bat more front palate tropical flavors of pineapple , mango. flavor carries through mid palate finishing w bitter stone fruit flavor. love it. mouthfeel is to me a little thinner than green. overall slightly superior beer than green. love it."
well this was another winner.. color is a completely opaque orangeish yellow.. smell is like ripe pineapple and citrus notes.. flavor is like a bigger green.. big bold fruit.. some bitterness.. I have to say I still prefer Green..
"Whoa. Pours an extremely hazy orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some but lingers on the surface of the beer throughout drinking. Intricate lacing left on the glass as it drinks down. Smell is piney, earthy, tropical and dank. What a combination. Tastes reflect the same - pineapple, citrus, dank hops. Best way to describe the feel is creamy. Like drinking a pineapple-orange-cream smoothy dusted with light pine. Downright delicious beer, high marks on this one"
"From growler. Extremely hazy deep orange. Finger foam head. Extreme lacing. And not really lacing, looks just like pulp resin from a glass of oj. Mehndi of foam. Only reason not 5 is the retention of the head. What a smell. Dank forest with a few pine trees and all kinds of tropical fruit trees within. Taste is hitting me with honey dew and mango. A bit of earthiness to wrap it together. Feel is velvet dollar bills. Smooth, some wet hop oil, and yet a bitter dry. Another stellar offering from TH."
"Can poured into a treehouse teku. Upon pouring, the coloring was a hazy golden color with a small amount of white head. The aromas are very similar to the regular Green with dank citrus and bitterness. The taste is just like the smell: dank citrus, grapefruit, herbal, and hoppy. The mouthfeel is smooth/silky, almost drinks slightly hot. Overall this beer was awesome and goes toe to toe with the regular Green which is one of my favorite TH offerings."
"A muddled cloudy orange, less bright than other cloudy tree house IPAs. The nose is a bautiful sweet, citrus hoppiness. The taste more bland and bitter than the nose, good but underwhelming after thy nose. This is a full yet easy drinking feel that's smooth to drink. Another top notch IPA from tree house."
Beautiful looking beer. Cloudy light orange-yellowish hue.
"How this beer isn't at 100 yet, blows my mind. Poured from a Tree House 750ml growler, bottled 1/14/2016."
Tropicana with pineapple.
L: Borderline opaque peach and golden hues with a thin 4mm bright white head and moderate lacing
"Near perfect, this was phenomenal, taste reminds me of Sip of Sunshine, but better IMO. Loved it, cant wait to have another."
"Definitely one of the top Treehouse beers, however I may actually slightly prefer regular Green to Very Green, ESPECIALLY considering the hype/difficulty to get. Treehouse has Green and Haze dialed in 100% and perfected."
"This is the best beer that Tree House brews. Very tropical, sweet, and easy drinking. "
"L - ah, good ol' Green. Not as turbid as its little brother, but a beautiful deep hazy orange. It's almost like it has its own power source. A miniature radioactive core emanating out to the edges of the glass. Darker with tangerine fringes. Ultra-fine bubbly head clings to the glass with every jostle. I could swirl this for days. "
"wow what a great beer, juice, fragrant and a boomer. one of if not the best beer i have had. will try to trade for it again. nice hazy, tastes and smells like a tropical fruit stand. feels great. perfect carb."
"It is what it is. King Julius is to Julius as Very Green is to Green. A stronger Green, with a bit more flavor. Truly amazing. Didn't think something as awesome as Green could be made any better but here we are."
"L: super hazy, almost like grapefruit juice. A nice white head"
"A: Pours a nice super cloudy amber with a thick but small white head, great lacing down the glass."
Poured from a 16oz can dated yesterday.
"Drank the same day it was canned. Pours a creamy orange, frothy with a one finger head and plenty of glass lacing. Smells of sweet citrus, dank, and hoppy. Tastes of fresh mango, orange and citrus. Crisp and tropical, so smooth and so drinkable - controlled bitterness, faint sweetness. Really stellar. The flavor matches, then exceeds just about any Tree House IPA. Green is an excellent IPA, so no doubt this was exciting before even cracking the can. But Very Green exceeded expectations."
"Pours cloudy, opaque orange. Tastes and smells nearly identical to regular Green. That is the reason I rate it so high: the fact that Tree House can mask the amped up level of booze without compromising the unique juicy and dank flavor profile. Worth trying if you can find a trading partner. The latest release had some pretty low limits."
Absolute perfect beer. I liked the draft better than the Heady Topper from a can.
Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Party.
Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Reviewed from notes.
Everything that green has but more. From an eight oz pour into my tasting glass - during the 3rd anniversary party thrown on 6.13.15
Poured from a 750 mL growler filled today.
"Poured out of the growler into a Hill wine glass. Soft pillowy white head. Hazy, burnt orange yellow color. Looks amazing. Smell is tropical fruits galore. Tangarine, mango, papaya and a biscuity malt sweetness in the back. This tastes like straight up juice, but only better. Huge orange flavor up front and finishes clean with that nice biscuit malt. Dare I say, better than Julius? I'd put this against any Hill beer."
"Killer aroma, great mouth feel, flavors that back all of that up on the palette. Honestly this is on par with all of the great IPAs we have seen from Treehouse"
A little over rated.
"01/2016 - This is effing delicious - hype realized and then some! So many fruit flavors, so juicy, that typical TH peppery bite; creamy, flavorful. Yum!"
"so perhaps this one improved with age but those saying this batch of JM is meh either dont like juicy IPAs or are out of their fucking minds!! its a gorgeous looking brew pours out hazed golden orange with a dense and creamy bright white head that leaves great lacing. mellow aromas of pineapple, peach, and mango. but where this one really shines is the palate - somehow it manages to be incredibly robust and simultaneously soft, delicate, and smooth. there is heaps of candied orange, creamy peaches for days, mango, slightly spicy pineapple, lime, grapefruit, and a subtle herbal green quality, a mellow smack of bitterness on the finish perfectly compliments the soft and creamy flavors, hint of that signature TH bubblegum and cereal malt. mouthfeel is lush which accentuates the intended flavors. had to really concentrate on not chugging this because it was so easy drinking and smooth. while TH was one of the first to master the haze juice IPA, making a ridiculous IPA is no longer exceptional but without any question this one fits into the 'perfect' category in my mind."
Hard to get hype- DDH Fort Point kills this as well as a lot of other recents- Lone Pine Chaos Emeralds. Even their own Super Typhoon much better. Glad to try but underwhelmed
"I'll preface my review by stating that the can of Juice Machine I was able to track down had a bit of age on it. Predictably, the beer had fallen off just a bit."
Amazing fruit explosion. Juicy and soft mouthfeel. Delicious
Purchased from the brewry a few weeks ago. Poured into a Duval tulip glass. Lovely color with a head that quickly dissapated. A light complex feel that was dry with melon flavors.
Looks like a mango smoothie with topped with cloudy suds for days. 
"Doopie opened this on beer night a couple weeks ago. Cheers, man!"
Can 6/12/18 
"There's a lot of hype surrounding this beer. I had it on tap at the brewery a few days ago and thought it was nothing special. Thick and very hoppy, but I got no juice from it. It wasn't bad, but all the hype wasn't worth it. I think their regular offerings are better than JM. this beer gets a shoulder shrug."
"2 cans from the brewery. First weekend was incredibly aromatic, flavorful, smooth. 2 weeks later, merely above-average DIPA."
"Canned 06/12/18, “I LIKE ROBOTS”."
L. Canned 6 12. Second try first review. Cloudy orange/melon color thin head
"Been waiting to try this ever since I discovered Tree House last year, and it didn’t disappoint."
A: Hazy amber. Darker then I was expecting. Not the usual look from Tree House
"Pours a hazy dull golden. Tropical coolatta aroma. I get pineapple and mango. It definitely has a smoothie vibe to it. Loads of citrus, clementine, orange, a little bit of rind but with a tinge of how a sharpie smells. There's a bit of pez candy to this. I'm not a big fan of how it finishes. Am I missing something?"
Canned 6/12/18; drank 6/24/18 @ the Yarchives. 
A: Poured from the can into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is dark golden-amber; hazy/murky. 
"Picked-up two cans at the Tree House Brewery last week for five dollars and five cents/ can. Very fine brew, but did not quite live up to the hype for me."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big white fluffy head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of mango, papaya, bubblegum, melon, and cantaloupe. The beer tastes of mango, papaya, bubblegum, melon, and cantaloupe. The feel is medium and creamy. An excellent IPA from Tree House."
Does not live up to the hype if this beer was brewed more no one would care. It's an slightly above average DIPA nowadays. Wrench from Industrial Arts I bought at the package store was better.
Look: golden orange with a gorgeous 1.5 inch creamy head 
Fresh can 6.12.2018 and over all good beer but fell below hype. Compared to Gggreen and very green it was in 3rd.
Wow.
"From a 16oz can, dated 06/12/18. 'I've been thinking about getting metal less.' I don't know what that means. Served in a willi glass."
Finally...after trying the 2014 trial batch I get to try this rendition. Missed it every release for the past 2.5 years; I get to share this with JLindros.
Big thanks to rudzud
"Initial reaction to this beer was WOW! A veritable cornucopia of fruit flavors: pineapple, papaya, mango, strawberry, nectarine, peach, tangerine, orange. The flavor shifted a bit as my glass of beer warmed up. Mouthfeel was awesome and the smells lingered a long time. However overall this was a bit much, toward the end I could taste the alcohol. I prefer very green and doubleganger over this beer. Fantastic beer though."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass.
Wow!!!
Best brewery in the world... which kills me to admit as I live in LA and this a NE company... but it's the truth... its... the... truth...
"Tasted from can. Pours super juicy orange with white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Papaya, mango, guava, melon, passion fruit along with some orange. Very well balanced. Flavors of tons of tropical fruits like the nose. Goes down super easy. Incredible imperial IPA"
Was able to get JM in a 750 ml growler back in September the day after the cans were released. Simply amazing. Top 3 beers I've ever had.
Perfection
"I loved this. It was almost 2 months old but still great, The nose was extremely tropical and so creamy. It has that perfect Tree House flavor that is so characteristic. Now, the hype and secondary market prices are something completely ridiculous."
Was not impressed at all by this. Way over hyped. Not worth what people are paying for it. A lot of better IPAs out there than this one. Had this side by side with Old Nation M43 and it wasnt even close. M43 was wayyyyy better.
"Well, Maybe the Hype was unmatchable - I'm not sure but this was a very good beer it didn't live up to it IMO. A solid beer I'd def drink again - smooth and juicy like most Treehouse brews. I had Very Green the day before and preferred it over JM."
"Amazing aroma fills the air as soon as I pour the beer. You don't have to hold it up to your nose to smell it. There's lots of fruit to be sure, but it has the same vegetal, stinging, flavor that I don't care for in Green. Its like an orange, hop juice smoothie. I guess this is what a lot of people look for in IPAs, but its not my preference. I get pineapple, peach, lemon, stawberry, kiwi, but just too much vegetable flavor to make this world class. It is good. The mouth feel is full, but a little yeasty and messy. Carbonation is low. I'm glad I got to try this, but I wouldn't trade for it again."
"so smooth, easy and fluid. wonderful flavors and aromas, could easily go down in a couple of gulps if one didnt seek to try to appreciate it. all the descriptors are in other reviews below..... but this could be the pinnacle of juice bombs"
It tastes like hoppy pineapple juice. One of the best beers I have ever had. It is definitely worth the hype. A clear step above very hazy and very green. I feel dumb for trading a JM for either of those
Fantastic Nectar from Monson. Not worth the 65 bucks a can secondary though.
This was my first Treehouse monster and did it deliver. As soon as I cracked the can the fruity citrus aroma filled my nose. The taste was incredible a true juice bomb
Deep orange color with little carbonation. Smells mostly citrus but I taste mango the most with lots of other fruits. This beer leaves the best taste in your mouth. Smooth and pretty much no burn.
Second time in a row for JM. Different from the first time I had it. Seems to be murkier / darker than before. Smells of a deep fruity amalgamation that is more complex than the last time around. Typical TH mouthfeel with a taste that is less citrusy and light than before but deeper and more sinister. I think TH Charlton beers (if this is one of them) are coming around. The rise of the machine...
"Purchased at the brewery 4/1/17. Poured into a tulip that night. Beautiful in the glass, turbid orange delightfulness. Smells of ripe pulpy orange and tangerine up front and then deep with tropical peachy fruits, a hint of dankness. It. Tastes. So. Freakin. Good. Its just balanced and sweet and bitter and fruity and perfect. This is a special beer."
"Nate is a Master at his craft, he continues to produce the most superior product available anywhere."
Canned 09-15-16. Drank 10-17-16. Name says it all.
"Pours a very very hazy yellow orange. The smell is outrageous in this beer. Mango predominates along with notes of melon, lemon, pineapple, and little hint of passion fruit at the end. The name is fitting as this is a fruit explosion. Unfortunately this particular beer is a tad past its prime and you can tell the taste has fallen off (the smell is still there). It has none of the nuance and complexities of the smell or other Treehouse brews. I wish I could of tried it fresh as I imagine it would have followed the smell when really fresh. It is medium bodied and feels thick like most treehouse brews. Overall this is a great beer that really shows you how complex an IPA can get."
"Pours nice deep orange, merky as hell. A nice white head that fades quickly. Aroma is mango,tangerine and passion fruits very deep. Taste is mango, passion fruit,orange peel, tangerine very deep in flavor. Very well made. Look forward to more from them"
"Tree House Juice Machine (Review #100, though I wish I'd done something more special in retrospect.)"
Once of the best beers ever made. Pure beer juice. Just unreal.
"This rare offering from Tree House is absolutely superb. It has that great New England Orange Juice like, opaque haze. The aroma is truly the best part of this brew with loads and loads of pineapple and other tropical fruits. The taste is not as overwhelmingly amazing as the smell but it is still very much reminiscent of eating pineapple, oranges, and mango all at the same time. Very pillowy mouthfeel with a sparky sweetness and minimal bitterness that keeps me coming back for more Tree House. This may very well be a blend of their foundation brews, but who knows except the beer gods that blessed the brewers in MA."
"finally get to try this. big pour into a snifter. pours dark orangeish but so opaque it's almost like looking at straight pulpy mash. the outer portions seem to glow cause toward the middle of the glass the color gets darker. nose bursts with papaya, mango, orange, pineapple, melon. taste up front is soft tropical melons and "
Just another great beer from the best brewery. Their worst beer is good. At least from the 8 i have had.
"One of the absolute best, softest, most delectable mouthfeels I've ever experienced in any beer. That is the highlight for me as the aroma and flavor lag behind many other beers of this style."
"Thickly opaque solid orange, verging on Orange Julius but not quite. It almost looks and behaves like a Tired Hands Milkshake, but again just not quite as thick or unusually tan, but more vibrant. Juice Machine is topped with a thick, off-white head that leaves behind of layer of lace every few levels."
Hazy pumpkin orange color. Off white head with a lot of lace.
Based on 2018 batch = Downgraded
"This tastes like a Julius and Green cuvee from front to back. Typically delightful and excellent Treehouse offering. No one does hops better. With that said, I liked this a little less than Julius, Green and some of the offerings."
"Bright glowing orange color, and foamy head with moderate retention. Huge tropical fruit, orange, mango, pineapple nose. Biggest longest lasting nose of any tree house beer or any beer period that I've head. Great soft and lasting mouthfeel, good carbonation, great all around juice bomb!! Right up there in my opinion with VH, King JJJ, VG, KJ."
Week old. Kept cold the whole time until drank.
"This beer pours murky and hazy like a pureed. The nose is reminiscent of a vintage 2013-14 era Lawson's IPA. The taste is bitter with a subdued tropical sweetness that lingered on the lower palate. It felt like this beer was holding back, as though a second wave of juicy goodness was possible but never shined through. Overall, a bit too hyped for my liking."
Poured from a 16 oz can dated 9-15
Canned 9/15/16. Consumed 9/20/16.
16oz. can into a Surly teku. Canned 9/15/16. Shared with schen9303. 
Drank from a 1 pint can
"Wow what an amazing beer! Pour a very hazy, dull orange color. A thin layer of foam. The smell blows me away I am picking up predominant pineapple, followed by orange, and then some faint grassy notes. Just an absolute tropical fruit bowl. The taste closely follows and has got to be one of the most delicate tasting beers I've had. Great orange, mango, pineapple, and peach notes. After a few seconds, I get the resiny bitter flavors, but not at all astringent. For 8.2%, scary drinkable and no trace of alcohol burn. Definitely going to trade for this one again!"
WOWzer. 
"This offering by TH looks way too think. I think light went in maybe 1/16"". And it's a weird shade of orange, sort of orangish brown. And it sort of glows. In fact, I poured some out of the growler into a brown 12-oz bottle to save for a friend. I open the fridge, and this one stands out more than any of the others. It literally glows. The smell is unique: lots of typical TH tropical fruit smells, but a little spice note too. It's more complex. The taste needs some getting used to. There's so much going on that my tastebuds needed several sips to adjust. It had many layers of complexity, but I'm not sure they were smooth. I kind of feel like the hype around this one is the limited release of it. Mouthfeel was unique: low carbonation is the norm for TH, there were a lot of resins, and an astringency that stung at first. Overall, I'll trade this one if I come across another one."
oh my lord this was good
"This is the BEST IPA I have ever had. Consumed amongst it's peers, some real heavy hitters, this was so far ahead of the pack! My stranded on an island beer..."
"Appearance- Typical Treehouse look: orange, turbid, and a pillowy two finger head."
Green family tree has a marriage with Doppelganger.
"Pours super cloudy golden brown..the color really has bands of gold and brown with 1/4 inch head. Smell is pineapple and mango. Taste is apricot, lemon, peach, burnt pineapple, and mango. Low carbonation but super light..feels soft, especially compared to other Tree House beers. The lightness and perfect body is what makes this one stand out. Super juicy. Amazing. Feeling bad that I keep on giving these Tree House IPAs 5s, but I feel they are really in a class by themselves. Hands down better than 99.99% of all other beers I have had. Well worth seeking out. Happy I drove and got a six."
What a phenomenal brew. Glad I was able to get the full allotment from the brewery on 9/15. The malt bill of KJ + the hop schedule for VG - The holy grail for me. Consumed same night from a tulip.
Wow. Just Wow.
"Juice Machine is amazing, arguably the best I've ever had. Tree House continuously knocks it out of the park with amazing yet uniquely-inspired beer. To use the term ""juice-bomb"" would be an understatement. It's like an asteroid of juicy/hoppy goodness hitting your tongue without the total bummer of killing off all the dinosaurs. If you can get it, GET IT!"
"Hazy, opaque brown/orange - Delicate white lacing. Looks like a TH beer"
"I could have sworn I rated this one a long time ago, but I guess not. I wasn't as impressed with it as I was expecting to be. I'd take so many other TH beers instead, but I guess that's what happens when you brew so many stellar beers. Despite being slightly let down, I of course would drink it again in a heartbeat...just to be sure."
"Its like sucking on an orange, but cold and refreshing."
My favorite yet
"Look: Pours a golden to orange, consistent color throughout. No sediment"
"Best DIPA and for that matter, best IPA I have ever had. I drank this in January <1 mon old. "
"Great beer, but not in my TH top 5. Actually think the name and label skewed a lot of peoples' opinions of it. It's certainly not their juiciest beer, or their most well executed. Still great compared to almost anything else..."
"Having had most of the ipas in the top tier, this is probably my favorite. It's all in the title and I don't know had they pulled this one off, but I want a lot more juice machine."
"I've never smelled a better nose than I do on this beer. Pure papaya/pineapple juice with a ton of juicy hops. There's a reason it's called Juice Machine! Has a surprisingly fluffy mouth-feel, and the taste is an explosion of the juiciest, dankest hops of all time. This is TH's best IPA by a mile."
"Poured opaque into a tall pint glass with about an inch of dense cream foam. Nose is heavy citrus, orange and drinks the same with mango and grapefruit accenting the hops. Wish I could have every morning with my eggs."
"A tad old, but been dying to try. Straight pineapple juice bomb! Hop balance & feel are spectacular. Surely the ""juiciest"" beer I've had. If fresh may be my new favorite."
"This beer was awesome, like a juicy hoppy pineapple bomb. It's unfortunate how rare this beer is. I hope they do it again. Would love to try it a few more times to see how I feel about it. Smells unbelievable. This beer was awesome, Looking forward to trying it again."
Wow. Hard for me to choose between this and King Julius as the beer I would most want to be stuck with on a desert island. Outstanding.
"This would have been an easy '5' if it had been fresh, but at 2 months old it went from being orgasmic to fucking awesome. Knocks to everything but appearance."
"A great beer no doubt, but I found the term ""juice machine"" slightly at odds with the ""heaviness"" of the DIPA. Green is more of a juice bomb for me, and Alter Ego is more of a crispy hop bullet while Julius is just mellowness at its best; Juice Machine comes across to me close to a Second Fiddle - not as juicy and definitely on the stronger side - but a frigging great beer nonetheless."
"Drank this at just shy of 2 months old. Exactly as described, juice mixed with beer. It was very tropical, lots of citrus flavors. Very smooth and well balanced, great beer overall."
"WOW. I am not a big fan of IPAs most of the time, but Juice Machine was so flame. So much fruit and bursting with hops. This is probably the juiciest beer I have ever had."
Had from both a can and 750ml. I would say the 750 held up much better than the can.
Sooooooo juicy
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a medium thick white head (almost picturesque. Smell is unbelieveable, honestly how can an ipa smell like a fruit explosion. Mostly pineapple but lower hints of orange, citrus, and finish of mango. Taste makes me question if there are even hops in this beer, a banquet of fruit that makes me want to let it linger on my tongue for as long as I can keep myself from drinking it. Feel is extremely smooth which really helps with the part mentioned before. Easily the best beer that has past my lips to date. Gonna be really hard to top this one.(Can was a month old so review may be off. Also drank side by side with a fresh cycle crank and a tree house green canned last week)"
"Poured from a can into a teku. Hazy orange color reminiscent of orange juice. Huge nose on this one, bursting with tropical fruit. Taste follows suit with tropical fruit followed by a light bitterness. No apparent alcohol...straight juice!"
"Pours a hazy yellow/orange color with a light white head that dissipates quickly, some lingering through drinking. Lacing on the glass, very solid for a beer of this ABV. Smell is an absolute juice burst - pineapple, orange, citrus, mango, maybe even some apple. Taste is exclusively the same - can't even detect the alcohol, straight juice. Feel is extremely smooth. Wow, what a beer. One of the best I've ever had, period."
"From can. Looks identical to the Very Green, which is a good thing. Holy hell how do I sort through this smell. A citrus explosion bursting through a pine wall. Taste is incredible. A fruit stand mixed into a blender with a pronounced pine. Hops orgy. Well carbonated and velvet smooth. A touch dry and sticky. Just wow bro. Just wow."
"Hazy orange color. The nose is a slightly musty bouquet of citrus fruits, not sweet like most of tree houses IPAs. The taste is slightly bitter with a hunt if the fruits. The feel is full with the bitterness coming through. Overall a solid beer, but not in the top tier of tree house IPAs."
"I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said. Look is a dark hazy feel. Like Orange Juice at the last bits of the container type of look. White foamy head that gives way to excellent lacing. Aroma is very tropical when poured cold, but as it warms the pine comes to the front. The taste follows. Slightly bitter when cold, but very tropical and juicy, with a small amount of pine. As it warms that tropical aspect remains but the pine comes through a bit stronger on the finish. I wish I had more, definitely one of my favorites."
"Probably the finest looking beer I've seen. While I can't say this is the best beer I've ever had, it's surely close. Hard to imagine there is 8.2% ABV let along 2%! If you told me I was drinking juice, I'd probably believe you. I'd likely rank JM as my 2nd favorite Treehouse beer that I've had till date (and that says a lot) right behind King Julius. Can't wait to try it again."
"Probably the finest example of a DIPA I have enjoyed from Treehouse so far!! Loved this one!!! Looks like Orange Juice, smells like heaven and tastes amazing! Hops! Fruit! Lived up to the hype!"
"Not my favorite TH IPA, but they are all fantastic."
Fresh can poured into snifter.
Canned 12/30/15 poured into an TH Tulip 
"Pours orange, cloudy, hazy color with about a 1 inch head. Smells of mango and tropical fruits. Tastes the same with some pineapple notes with a moderate bitter back end in the finish. Minimal alcohol taste even though it is a double IPA. Wonderful beer"
"Luckily was not working this day when TH dropped Juice Machine. Poured into a TH teku and had instant aromas of citrus fruit. The appearance was a hazy orange color (somewhat like OJ). The taste was amazing! It followed suit with the aromas. Strong Pineapple and mango upfront, with each sip having loads of tropical notes. As the beer breathes and comes closer to room temperature, the complexity really kicks up a notch. The mouthfeel was silky smooth. Overall, this has now become one of my favorite Treehouse offerings, up there with King Julius and Very Green. I REALLY hope they release this one again! Cheers!"
Canned 12/30/15 poured into an IPA tulip
L - Typical murky dark orange with a finger of white head
Thought I had reviewed this beer or at least ticked it last year!
"This is probably the best IPA I have ever had. It is certainly the juiciest. You can feel the juice in your cheeks after each sip. It has an excellent body, although not over hazy. It is smooth and delicious without being overly dank. This is it."
"This beer is amazing. Pours a hazy orange into a snifter glass. an inch of solid white head. The smell is awesome, fruit salad. Melons and citrus. Taste is outrageous. It's like a cantaloupe watermelon fruit punch. substantial mouth feel. I loved this beer."
"Poured from growler, first one was 10 days old, this one is 15 days old... a perfect beer! I love all TH beers and have stopped rating some of them because its getting redundant---so frickin tasty (like every curiosity beer they create!).... But this one is so perfect, the nose and tastes of peach, orange, tropical funk, melon... so crisp and refreshing, nuanced, and smooth--esp for a DIPA-- they set the bar so high and then continue to leap over it.... All I need now is a second home next door to the brewery!"
Copied and pasted the previous reviewer- could not have expressed it any better!!
Julius on steroids.
"Pours a golden white-orange with a one finger head. Dry hopped. Smells of sweet citrus, candied fruits, dank, and hoppy. Taste is clean tropical blast of citrus. Smooth and fantastic. ABV is well-disguised. This is the very definition of drinkable. This beer carries the token Tree House tropical flavor and blends it with a bitter balance that makes for an unmistakably world class IPA. Top notch from Tree House that stands with all the bests in the business."
The aroma hits with peach for day.
Poured from a 16oz can into a Tree House tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery today. 
"This IPA for a New England East Coast style is perfect. Pours pure hazy OJ. Smells like pure tropical fruit juice. Taste I can get Mango, Pineapple, Papaya. Tastes like I should be drinking this on a beach. Super velvety creamy mouthfeel. Overall an amazing beer. My favorite IPA and possibly one of my favorite beers!"
"I went into this expected to be let down, but I was wrong, This poured a dirty hazy filthy orange that I absolutely love when it comes to IPA. I can easily taste the fruit profile assocated w the hops, but surprisingly the smell wasn't evident to me. Overall though my TreeHouse Experience has been"
"If TH's Green and a box of juicy juice magically grew beverage genitalia and went at it, this would be the beer that popped out 9 months later"
Look - Doesn't even look like beer. Completely turbid. Juice like. Exactly how I like my IPAs to look. 
"L: Abundantly cloudy and hazy with light apricot and honey hues; few millimeter head with minimal retention, but great lacing"
"awesome citrus smell, very cloudy thick looking pale orange color. Crisp mouth feel very smooth and drinkable, very hard not to drink this one right down"
Can into tulip. 12/30/15 goose is loose
Appearance: turbid and cloudy as fuck. Looks a lot like organic cold pressed orange juice. It's just an opaque murky beer concoction and it looks super cool. Nice white pillowy head with all kinds of bubbles rising to the top.
"This beer is simply amazing. It pours cloudy, with an amazing ""Tree House"" smell full of citrus. I had it on its first release in November of 2015 and its just as amazing as I remember. I've had all of Tree Houses offerings but Good Morning and I have to say, this is the true king of Tree House."
I haven't been moved to review a beer in a while. This one however has awoken the sleeping bear. 
This is like a combo of other Tree House beers.. has the Pineapple and bitterness Green has combined with the bursting notes of Julius.. this could be my favorite beer ever from them...
Drank this in when it came out in 2014. It was pretty good and I really enjoyed it. It was the first beer that I tried that evening. It was hazy orange in color and tasted like and early curiosity.
"I'd love to discuss this with a tree house lover. No denying it's a good beer. Does it taste like about at least 10 ipas they have put out under different names? Well ya it does. Not sure if it's the yeast or they think you all dumb, but most of their beers taste the same. Very good? Yes, but give me the ones with less lines and bigger limits that taste the same."
Another home run from the best brewery in the country
"Tree House has officially become boring with this beer. I've been a big fan of TrH for a while, but don't get the hype on this one. It's basically Julius (a decent, but definitely overrated, too, IPA) with more alcohol. Citrus, yes, lots of it, but basically yeasted carbonated light mandarin juice. Uneventful, forgettable for a TrH beer. Good, but not great."
Week old can poured into a tulip glass.
"Canned 12/30/15. First can into a TH snifter 5 hours after canning, second can on 1/3/16. "
Incredibly drinkable with the hop profile. Scary drinkable for a DIPA. Mango and pineapple on the finish and pillowy soft mouth feel. Only behind KJ and GM
This is one of the best beers that I've ever had. The aroma is insane! The mouth feel is creamy with the taste of tropical fruits. Medium carbonation and nice lacing. Outstanding DIPA!
"Thick creamy DIPA, reminds me of Trillium IPAs. Looks like OJ in the glass, super fruit, grapefruit and other citrus."
Canned on 12/30/15; drank on 1/1/16 in a tulip glass; just an incredible DIPA on every level for my tastes
"The entrance on this beer is second to none. Unmatched fruit scents and flavors as it meets your nose and mouth. After that, it suffers from a past its sell-by-date OJ/pineapple juice darkness and fizziness. Alcohol burn doesn't help, but does remind you it's a beer. I wonder if this was a batch of King Julius that wasn't up to snuff that they quickly repackaged. Tastes more like an attempt at Trillium style than TH."
"Got fresh off the line. Drank next day. Amazing citrus fruit smell. Light hazy orange color, typical of DIPAs. Excellent fruit flavors, a bit of sweetness and a pleasant aftertaste. Right amount of carbonation. Another great Tree House beer"
"When Tree House drops new offerings the lines are ridiculous. I kept seeing updates on how long the lines were. I showed up later in the day and the place was dead...parked at the door, walked in and was out in less than a minute! I love being a local! Typical TH Fruit hammer as soon as you open the can. Pours a solid orange color with with a soft 2 finger head. Strong Pineapple and mango upfront, each sip just slams tropical notes. Very Julius like composure with a higher level hop kick. Really digging the drinkability of this one. As it breathes in the glass the taste just keeps improving, hard to put down. I hope we see Juice Machine again in the future."
Look-amazing golden dark deep hazy orange with a beautiful slight orange tinted head that doesn't hang around too long.
"Still a newbie to drinking IPA's but with this Microbrew in my back yard, hard to not enjoy. I've tried a little over a dozen of the TH Brews and this is my favorite. At this stage I tend to lean more to a little juicier than hoppier, but this one nailed it. Perfect balance. Get in my BELLY!"
"Thought Haze was my favorite DIPA from TH, but this little robot might be changing my mind."
"Just fantastic. To quote a buddy, ""It's Like a cage match between Green and Julius."
"Pours a turbid orange haze color, with a slight white head. Looks amazing. The smell is like Julius/King Julius. Loaded with tropic fruits, mangos, pineapple, oranges. Taste follows the nose. Its an absolute juice blanket. What makes this beer so impressive is that it is a IIPA.. Cant recall having a double with this much tropic flavor to it ever. World class!"
"Pours an opaque orange. Beautiful in the glass. Sharp tropical smell, most comparable to green out of the TH beers I have had. Taste is just unrelenting sip after sip - strong citrus fruits of all kinds in the front with more of a bitter taste on the back end. Feels great, very smooth with a little bit of a sharp bite at the end."
"Real glad i made it before they sold out. pours hazy orange with a light head. Aroma hits you in the face immediately with tropical fruit, heavy on orange, and hops. taste is a blast of fruit most notably mango, orange, and pineapple with a bitter grapefruit on the back end."
This brewery can do no wrong. Easily top brewery in USA right now. 
"L - Pours an absolutely gorgeous blood orange head. Think Green, but with a more aggressive darkness to it. A light, fluffy head tops it all off. Silky and soft. I want to rub my face in it. You can see where it sinks in some places while the rest of the bubbly structure holds strong. It's trying its very best to retain itself!"
Straight fruit Juice on the nose. It drinks like C22 with a little bite. Smooth as silk and does not drink like 8.2%. Another juice bomb by this incredible brewery. New England is Beer heaven.
Fantastic.
"This is the best DIPA I've ever had, it's king Julius malt bill with Very Green hop schedule, and it reminds me more of Green than Julius ( I've not had KJ or VG) still perfect balance, tropical and so smooth for 8+ % Treehouse generally is awesome, but they knocked this out of the park!"
"Outstanding! This is about as close to a ""Tropical"" beer that I've ever had. I wondering how they fit all the juicy, citrus flavor into this DIPA. This beer was canned about six hours ago so I'm going with that fact that it can't get any fresher. Another in a long line of hits from Tree House"
"Canned today (12/30/15); poured into a Tree House tumbler. The look on this is insane. I know that turbid sh*t isn't for everyone, but for me, the Hunter, it's akin to Simona Halep playing tennis pre-surgery. Good God! Can I get a witness? Amen. Fantastic head retention and lace beyond reproach. Masterful. The nose gives exponential doses of tropical mayhem that isn't overwhelming, or cluttered. The scent demands your attention, and it delivers in spades. The taste follows with all that juicy goodness in layers. Each sip gives a different interpretation of citrus, pineapple, young mango, fresh pear, rainbow, Starburst, lemon, grapefruit. It finishes dry, and it envelops the taste buds with a faint grainy cracker taste. It's not seamless, but I won't let that ruin the experience. There's a tug and pull on the end that suggests it could be tweaked to mere perfection moving forward. I have no doubt that the masters at Tree House will continue to perfect this offering. F*ck! Tree House figured something out with hops, and I'm glad they did. This beer is on another level -- above the penthouse. I truly hope they offer it year-round because I think I may like it more than Julius. I just had a beergasm. Murder She Wrote."
"This beer lives up to the name. Pours a typical hazy opaque orange, similar look to Green. Smell is very tropical. Taste is pretty similar to Very Green, in a good way. Heavy tropical fruit, definitely get the galaxy hops in this. Smooth, light carbonation. Overall, a phenomenal beer."
"First thing you taste is legit Juicy Fruit. The label is very apt for this brew. Very slight bitter hop taste with the finish. For 8.2% , it is not boozy at all."
"Im not one to get too crazy with descriptions, everyone's nose and taste buds are different. It definitely has a lot of characteristics of Green. The first glass I poured had a carbonation feel to it. Left a grapefruit, bitter finish that went really well with the initial taste of tropical fruit. Tree House honestly can't miss, I've never had a beer from them that I havent loved and they really have ruined me because I try other beers and they never can compare. Another great batch from them."
"Beautiful tangerine color with a big thick finger and a half of head with layers and layers of beautiful lacing on the teku. Deep, deep aromas that remind me of Green, with a taste that is also very similar to Green. Almost impossible to detect any alcohol which shocks me being 8.2 ABV. There's a snappy crispness to this beer and a flavor that really drops off the palate and doesn't linger, in a seltzer-y kind of way. Because of this, I don't think the name Juice Machine is totally appropriate - I'd say for my palate Haze and Julius are juicier than this. I prefer the more round-flavored gushers over the crisp stuff but overall enjoyed it. As someone who gets to Treehouse weekly, I don't know if I'd run back for this one, especially at $4.50 a can, but I do like getting a chance to try their seldom-made stuff and glad I got to try this one. I'd still take Haze any day over this. I think a 4.4 is where this would lie for me."
"The Hype train is strong with this brewery.. This beer was overall very average and disappointing considering the long lines. I honestly think people opinions of Tree House beer gets skewed from the Monson days, It has to be good it's TH, truth is since Monson their beers are very average and others have caught up and passed them by. They clearly are out for the money and that's it's, where are the sours, BA stuff, farmhouse ales, etc. Their stouts have been great but even those seem very similar, I'm guessing they use the same base malts, same yeast with some maple here and some PB there. They don't seem to have any originality and really create something different.. Ride that train while you can I guess."
Canned 10/26/18; drank 11/10/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, mango, candy, and vanilla. It tastes of orange, citrus, mango, candy, bubblegum, and vanilla. The feel is medium and smooth. A great IPA from Tree House."
"Canned 10/26/18, drank on 11/5/18 after being sent a partially smashed can that had a hairline crack and was leaking. Boo hiss!"
"Canned on 10/26/18, consumed on 11/5/18. Makes this 10 days old."
A-Pours a hazy orange color with a generous head and lacing
"Canned 10/26/18, so just under a week ago."
Really hard to beat this beer. Have been waiting to try this for a few years. Worth the wait - seek it out.
"Pours hazy, light orange-yellow in color, with one third inch head. Taste is orange-rind, creamsicle, and starfruit. Medium-heavy bodied, medium-low carbonation, slightly bitter. Creamy. I feel as though Aaaalterrr Ego elevated a beer I did not care for and Sssappp and Gggreennn were the best renditions of the base beer possible. Jjjjuliusss was more in line with the original. Thicker, creamier feel than Julius but not as much of a difference on the original. Good beer, but I think I prefer the original."
October 2018 can release
Tree house 4th anniversary.
Juiciest beer ever
"Fruit juice, great aroma, and soft mouthfeel. This was intense and awesome in every way. I loved everything about this beer and it has citrus juice notes off the charts"
"Another TH winner. If you love Julius, this is a special treat. I find it a little more aromatic and and a little rounder flavor than Julius. Otherwise, it fits perfectly in the Tree House family"
"okay, there has to be a ceiling, right? i understand nothing is perfect, but how can you NOT give this 5s across the board? the head is a beautiful billowy white fluff, the aroma is sweet and juicy, the flavor is like Sunny D except smoother and the rest is, well, enough said.... got this in a 750 growler with the 'Grolsch-top"". as someone else said ""all 250 top beers are gonna be Treehouse""..... Pliny who? the evolution has begun!"
"So at this rate the entire top 250 is going to be Tree House beers - with half of them being Julius variants lol! But dammit if they aren't all delicious. This rendition to me tasted not too much different from the standard Dr. J, but that's not much of a complaint since it's one of my favorite IPAs out there."
Enjoyed this on 6/30 and reviewed from notes. Poured out of a 16 oz can with a canning date of 6/10/16 stamped on the bottom of the can. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA-specific glass.
"Tastes exactly as advertised. Like a really hopped up version of Julius. Needless to say, it's absolutely amazing. Best hoppy beer I've had. Even prefer it to KJJJ"
"Look is murky orange/brown, love it. Smell is near perfect, tons of mango/passion fruit/pineapple. pillowy soft mouthfeel with tons of soft juicy julius qualities. Taste is vvvvvvveerrrrryyyy good, not very green or king julius good but still damn incredible. You know when your IPAs are good when all you compare them to are other IPAs from the same brewery 1500 miles away. Overall its exceptional, this seems to be the norm with Tree House and I will be eternally envious of all people that live in proximity to this brewery."
Omg period. That's my review.
A: Incredibly hazy orange tinted gold with huge head. Looks like peach nectar with carbonation.
"Consumed side-by-side with 4 other TH beers, 5oz pour from a can."
"Tasted at approximately one week and two and a half weeks. A juicier, more complex Julius - the nose really stood out, especially at the one week old tasting, and the taste followed suit. Top of the line IPA."
Best TH I've had along with Very Hazy.
"Really delicious, smelt good for being a few weeks old. Definitely has that julius feel but really juicy and smooth. I still think King Julius is the best, but this was awesome and worth waiting for."
The beer comes in a medium hazy gold.
Can dated 6/10 acquired through trade. 
As amazing as amazing gets. Tree house keeps knocking beers out of the park and this one was hit a mile. I might even go as far as saying this is my favorite TH beer to date.
God yes
"I didn't think it was possible for treehouse to get better, but they keep stepping it up. This beer showcases that. A more hoppy, complex julius. Another th masterpiece."
"Once again another great beer from the mighty Tree House Brewing. The beer poured out hazy with a white head, The smell of the beer is loaded with a ton of citrusy hops. The taste is pretty stellar as well. The feel is creamy and smooth. Overall it's a great beer, no major complaints here."
Everything but the look of this beer was average. After seeing what it pulls it really makes me question why anyone would do it. If it wasn't hyped up I would say it's very forgettable. Had next to 4 Monkish beers and DDH Psuedo and Jjjuliusss ended in a unanimous distant dead last.
This tastes like tangerine juice that you steeped a teabag of Citra hops in. Incredible. Rounded soft mouthfeel that carries all the juicy citrus flavors. Minimal bitterness on the far back end.
"Great IPA right hur. Was it their best, no. There was so much hype on this one that I feel I bought in and was let down (somewhat). I would prefer others before this one. Let's not get it twisted tho. This is world class."
"Amazing IPA, easily top 5 favorite beer. I prefer this beer to King JJJuliusss even though both are above world class beers."
The couple of differences between this and normal Julius I notice are that:
Time to review this 750 of JJJUILIUSSS from Treehouse
Super hazy golden orange. White head with lace. 
"16oz can: 6/10/16 ""JJJUICE IS LLLOOSEEE"""
6/10/2016 can drank in a tree house chalice on 6/21/2016
Can thanks to DJ
"Sweet Jesus! Even by Tree House standards, this is absolutely incredible! Beautiful deep orange haze. Massive nose with notes of every delicious citrus and tropical fruit imaginable. The taste is all hops, with no bitterness and notes of pineapple, mango, and tangerine. There's virtually no booze and it's simply as pillowy as they come. Honestly one of the best IPAs I've ever had."
L: Hazy dark orange hues with a fluffy white head and ample lacing
Another solid offering from Treehouse. Tried this less than a week old side by side win a month old Regular Julius and both were solid AF. A little more hop bite on the Jjjuliusss ! Would love more!!
"Orange yellow deep color with a blast of orange and tropical citrus on the nose and palate. Can really taste the hops and oils. Nice thick foamy head, with moderate lacing. Nice full"
"How is this at a 97 right now??? Julius is an amazing, unique beer. But sometimes I wish it had a little more teeth. That's JJJuliusss. Should be at 101. Unbelievable IPA and definitely one of, if not the, best I've ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"Popped this bottle at an epic Omaha, Nebraska bottle share. Poured into a teku. I felt this was one of the best Tree House beers I've ever had. The nose, amazing! The mouthfeel, amazing! The taste, amazing! If I could just drink this and only this rest of my life it would be okay... Obviously I'm recommending it..."
"This beer has the flavor profile of King Julius, but ever so slightly (and I do mean slightly) dialed back, and the body of base Julius. The Aromas blast out of the can the moment it cracks. The look is more vibrant that Julius. The flavors far more intense and delicious. If KJ had a sessionable younger brother that retained 99% of the flavor profile, JJJuliusss! would be it."
"I can't believe I crap lucked out into this beer on my first visit. Strange place that the local government won't let prospective buyers even TRY a taste before buying. Strange and Monson, Ma should be ashamed of themselves. First thing I did when I got this beer bCk to the hotel room was surround it with ice and the wait an agonizingly long tome to get it cooled off enough to drink. I have never had a better beer. Heady, Sip, Epiphany, Second Fiddle, Lunch, and others. What a treat. Thank god I had my non beer drinking amazing wife who stood in line for 47.32 minutes (by her watch) and was able to pick up 12 of these beauties."
"This beer is everything that I wish the normal version of the beer was. Don't get me wrong, the normal version is awesome, but this one is light years ahead in terms of taste and smell. When they move to Charlton I hope that we see this one more often."
Think of JJJuliusss as simply a more hop-forward version of Julius. 
"Great looking pour, chalky rich orange, bold with a one finger head. Smells of citrus, tropical fruit... that real 'Tree House' IPA smell. The taste is outwardly more bitter and hoppy than Julius. Tropical fruit blast and smooth from all the dry hopping. The bitterness isn't so much that it's punishing. This is clearly a beer rooted in regular Julius, a nice addition to the line."
"Picked up 6 cans on Friday. This is an incredible juice bomb. More melons than a phi beta sorority. Mango is up front and center followed with orange peel and lemon zest. Hazy orange pour. The flavor follows the nose, so juicy. This is a beer and brewery to pledge your allegiance to."
"Got this from the brewery today. Absolutely brilliant. The moment you open the can the aroma dominates from am arms length away. Huge grapefruit, lemon rind and bitter orange. The taste follows suit with a nice dry finish. It doesn't get any better than this."
"Brewed to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the first experimental Julius being brewed; growler filled on 6/11/16 and drank in a Tree House teku the same day while watching the USMNT play Paraguay in the Copa; another awesome Tree House beer, for my palate is definitely a clear step up from the base version"
"Pours a bright orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some while drinking down. Strong lacing on the glass. Smell is like an orange creamsicle - creamy, orangey with some nice tropical notes. Taste reflects the same things - sweet orange flavor comes through nicely against slight bitterness to balance. Feel is excellent, very smooth. I don't know how I'll be able to go back to drinking a regular Julius after this bad boy. Delicious."
From growler. Super cloud of burn orange. Thick pillowy head. Laces well. I could smell it from a few feet away. Really smells just like fresh squeezed orange juice. This is definitely jacked up Julius. A touch of peel but truly tastes like juice. Super smooth and creamy. Carbonation a bit low. Well worth the 3 hour wait.
"Arrived at Row 34 for a pre EBF drink. We were there the night before and the bar tender immediately yelled over Julius? We had no idea what he was talking about. Another patron thankfully explained, yaaa, you need to get one of those. "
"People were freaking out as I stood in line when they announced that this one was on tap a few weeks ago. While it's a high class beer, it doesn't beat out its counterpart Julius. The part that stands out to me is its malty flavor; like many TH beers, it's loaded with juiciness. Definitely worth trying, but don't waste your efforts if you can grab some Julius."
Another one from the 3rd Anniversary Party.
Poured from the 25.4 oz. growler into a Tree House stemmed tulip.
wow.. Pours a deep orange.. obviously completely hazy like all TH. Aroma is super dry dank hop juice. Taste is hop up front then huge orange after that. It is unreal. Easily top 5 beer ever
"Pure citrus in taste. A great new style New England IPA. Turbid? Hell, yes."
Meant to write this review sooner...was lucky enough to catch it at the brewery wknd of 6/20. One of the best beers I have ever had! Delicious.
"This may literally be the best IPA I've ever had. It's outSTANDING. Honestly it blows Julius out of the water, and THAT is an amazing beer. There is so much dank, bright tropical citrus flavor & aroma going on, I can't begin to imagine the amount of hops that went into this. Brilliant."
Pours a cloudy yellowish color which you cannot see thru. The smell. Oh the Smell. A citrus bomb in the nose. Taste was not a citrusy as the nose with grapefruit and piney bitterness predominating. Wonderful bitter finish. Great mouth feel.
First batch 2015/06/01
"This is the absolute epitome of citrus juice-bomb IPAs. An almost perfect beer - dark orange light-swallowing in color, a bouquet of fresh, juicy citrus in the aroma, a nice level of carbonation, and an absolute transcendent taste of heavy citrus and some dank earthiness in not quite balance. Best IPA I've ever had."
"Hazy and golden in the glass. The nose is ripe to overripe tropical fruit -- guava, mango and orange. The mouthfeel is akin to a fresh squeezed glass of orange juice. It's perfect and thick. With the dry hopping, Julius is flexing like a DIPA. Seriously big flavor here. A tropical citrus bomb that adds an extra dimension to the reg. Really nice."
Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Reviewed from notes.
"Glorious, juicy oranges.. BOMBARDED with a super-fresh, ripping HOP BLAST.. Magnificent!"
"Juicy, delicious, nothing bad to say about this beer at all, one of the few 5/5 I've given."
"I bought this today, about 8 hours ago, and it has been in my cooler and then a fridge since then."
Poured from a 1.5L growler into a snifter. Growler filled 2 hours ago at the brewery.
The nose on this is just out of this world.
No bitterness at all. Easy drinking. Very unique balance of flavors.
One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Great taste and smell. Very easy to drink.
"A strong pour was needed for a 1/3 finger sized off white short lived foamy head. Irregular punctuation mark lacing, the head quickly shrunk to a ring. Labeled can, blue green dot, 11/02/18, is this too fresh? "
"Super juicy, super citrus. Nice and thick"
"Jon, thank you so much for this can. You're the best!"
probably the best IPA I have ever had.
"I've only rated one other beer 5's across the board, and that was a Double IPA. This is the best Low/Mid-ABV IPA out there, no doubt in my mind. Orange nose and flavors galore, and a joy to drink. This is a famous beer, and it lives up to its reputation. It is the standard to which all other juicy, NE-style single IPAs should strive. If you are seeking to enjoy the best that beers have to offer, Julius is the one to savor."
Massive citrus juice with plenty of Orange more so than mango. Nose and taste were big and pleasant. Great biscuity malt to back up the huge hops. Very drinkable but a bit bright vs soft on the carbonation. Then again could just be can vs draft.
Consistent top 10 beer out there.
look: Hazy peachy orange. Have admired this in pics for a while and up close doesn't disappoint.
Poured into a hybrid glass from a 16 oz can
Really Nice IPA
"This is one nice looking beer. Deep orange color, and super hazy. Big amount of thick white head with tons of lacing."
"First Treehouse experience, one pint and I am all in. "
Overall: I bought a mix pack at Treehouse. They're all delicious... BUT ALL THE SAME.
"When this is dialed in, it's the bees knees! The first time I had it back in November 2014, it was top notch. And I am happy to report that they're back to that same level once again - aromatic, juicy and fruity, yet a nice hoppy bitterness in the back without being West coast-esque. Tasty!"
Great Amber color and wonderful fruity aroma. Just sip and be happy.
"Very good beer, but by no means great. Overhyped, but overall solid product."
Poured from can into teku glass.
"This is a very good beer. I've been seeking good, craft beer for decades and this is in the upper echelon. I've had several from Tree House and it is honestly hard to distinguish one from another in terms of quality and, frankly, distinct character. Hate to say it but, you drink one Tree House beer and you've drank them all. But they are fantastic."
Anise aftertaste...at times unpleasant.
"A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color—as you get closer to the bottom of the can the color becomes darker and murkier. It poured with a finger high white head that gradually died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and some specks of lacing down the sides."
"Amazing IPA from Treehouse. Bursting with citrus and a non bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable 6.8% ABV, recommend a trip to the brewery in MA or a trade to taste this beer."
A really awesome tropical aroma. Just slightly more bitter than I envisioned but real tasty nonetheless!
"This beer pours a thick, milk shake, cloudy orange juice color, forming a 1-finger,creamy and rocky crown head. The smell is luscious citrus with an a creamy orange peel, mango, passion fruit, vanilla with a hint of pine. The taste is juicy with a creamy, zesty orange and stone fruit flavor with a medium mouthfeel and very little hop bitterness."

"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...love it"
"Pouring from a 16 oz. can that was canned on my birthday into a wine glass. This beer pours out and looks like a less bright orange juice, like maybe a natural orange juice and formed a perfect one finger dense and rocky crown. The smell is citrus and tangy with somewhat of a sweetness on the back, almost like a peach sweetness. The taste is the same thing but finishes with a dry cracker like element. I do want more bounce from it! Could use some more carbonation to make it shine for me. Overall, this was alright, and I do truly respect the balance that was brought, but I wanted more from it! Honestly a little disappointed..."
"Poured from fridge temp. Pours a lovely hazy orange with white head. Nose is awesome. Orange creamsicle, vanilla, a hint of pine. Very balanced and smooth on the nose. Taste is great. A slight bitterness is there, but mostly tropical notes of orange and banana. Maybe a touch of mango. Getting some citrus peel and pine for sure. Mouthfeel is spot on - medium bodied and a bit dry. Overall, a great balance and complexity in this hazy IPA."
Just awesome
"I've had a lot of IPAs, but this is probably my favorite. Very citrusy and smooth, it packs a punch but doesn't have a sharp flavor at all. Amazing brew"
16 oz into tulip.
"Canned 07/10/18 and drank on 08/17/18. Idk this beer wasn't so good. Very bitter taste and not juicy at all. Thought it would be more flavorful like Lawson's Sunshine or Mikkeller Windy Hill. Oh well, maybe the can I had was starting to turn bad. Just over 1 month though Idk. The SMELL was kind of citrus like, but the TASTE didn't follow the nose. You win some, you lose some."
"The beer that made me want to start experimenting during the home brew. Everything it is made out to be, soft pillowy mouth. Taste of mango with a small malt backbone."
Canned 6/19/18
"Good. But not as good as the hype. Doppelgänger beats this hands down. I have zero idea how this is rated so high. If you want a good treehouse beer drink their doppelgänger, that is good. "
"After wanting to get down to Treehouse from Canada for a few years now I finally made it this summer and was able to get 24 Julius along with some others I will review soon. Love the super hazy looking straw/orange colour. Carbonation is very active initially upon pouring and then settles to nothing rather quickly leaving just a small head which sticks around & leaves some thin wet lacing. Being that there's an orange on the label it's no surprise that the aroma & taste are hoppy orange forward. Also grapefruit & something a little tropical / passionfruity. Definitely some sweet astringent bitterness as well with a mouthfeel which could certainly be a little more full & smooth. Still, it's a classic, an excellent fruity NEIPA, & I will miss them when they are gone!"
"Smooth and pleasing. Very little bitterness, juicy."
I travel two hours and wait in line for an hour for this beer.
Better than Orange Juice.
Amazing IPA the hype is real with this one.
"Just a fabulous brew. Cloudy in the glass, juicy to the taste buds--a volley of fruit flavors trading places for prominence on your palate. State of the art IPA!"
"With all this haze craze, I seeked out the top brewery in this category. Beer is good but no wow factor. It’s better than most. Give me west coast ipa’s all day."
"Delicious in every way. Oh, and my 1,000th review."
"Buddy visited them and grabbed me a couple, I think it was $4 per, canned 6/6/18"
"From can dated 6/6/18, poured into a — what else — Tree House glass. "
"Great ipa in every way, it is a beautiful orange color in the glass with a low foam head, smells and tastes of tropical fruit, very low bitterness, very drinkable. These babies go down easy."
Canned 3 weeks ago.
The best
"I had waited to get my hands on a can of Julius for a long time. When I got it home, I was in awe of the aroma, taste, body and overall package that Julius is. I can have this beer all day long on a summer day as it is very drinkable and not heavy at all. The color and taste go hand in hand as it burst of tropical fruits."
"The juiciest hazy hop bomb I’ve ever had. So strange and magical. Creamy, zesty orange and stonefruit flavors and a lovely, soft mouthfeel with a medium-dry finish. Could this really have been achieved with just hops and malt? Apparently yes, but special malts make up the foundation for this hazy IPA. Perhaps one of the most singular beer experiences of my life. "
Best tasting beer I have had.
"I love Tree House and drive up often. They finally has Julius on my last visit. It's not my favorite beer from them, let me explain: It is an amazing beer, perfectly balanced and citrus notes galore, but compare to their other stars... this is a good starting point to get a Tate of where their beers are at. This goes down smooth and has an all day drinking appeal to it."
"Very different kind of beer - most of my experience is west coast and more old school IPA's, so this came as a bit of a shock. "
Could be my new favorite
"Wow, wow and once more wow. The only thing this beer is perhaps lacking is a bit of mouthfeel. I like some DIPA's from Tree House better because of that reason, but this beer is absolutely amazing. Peach is the first thing I smell in this intense hop-bomb. So smooth, so juicy, so tasty and not a bit of the bitter harshness that hoppy beers sometimes have. This is what New England IPA is meant to taste like"
"Amazingly Fruity, yet not too sweet. Easy to drink. Obviously it deserves a high rating and a place in top beers"
Pretty obvious that this is a great beer. A lot more rind and pine in both the nose and flavor then a lot of the rest of the tree house IPAs. But still a total juice bomb.
"Pours a golden straw yellow that is so hazy light can barely penetrate it. Big billowy white head that lingers for a while. Aroma is loads of piney hops, big citrus flavors of lemon and grapefruit. Flavor has a floral quality to it. Lots of grapefruit and lemon rind, some pineapple, a touch of dankness. Lightbodied, a little creamy, excellent carbonation. Easy to understand why this is ranked so highly. Outstanding and so easy to drink."
Yum!!!
"Smooth, juice bomb, hoppy but not a bitter aftertaste."
Top of the charts. 
"Dated 3/21. Pours orange cream color with abundant head. Smell is orange, cream, pepper. Taste is orange with an interesting pepper note at the end. Feel has a bit of a pepper note. Overall, slightly disappointed as I played this up in my head a lot, but still very good. It’s a pity I had this a month old at barely cellar temp. Would love to try cold and fresh."
"This is it! The perfect beer. Never had one before, but this (on draught at the brewery) was the best beer I've had in my lifetime."
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/11/2018. Pours opaquely hazy deep orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, orange juice, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, biscuit dough, light honey/toast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, orange juice, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, biscuit dough, light honey/toast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, orange juice, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper/pine, biscuit dough, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, lightly sticky, and slightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.8%. Overall this is an insane NEIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink; with the mildly bitter/drying finish, never aggressive. Spot on soft mouthfeel. Insanely juicy, vibrant, and fairly dank hop complexity; balanced bready malt/oat backbone, with mild lingering sweetness. A highly amazing offering, and spot on style example as expected."
By far my favorite so far
Great beer. I understand the hype on this beer. Pure goodness!!
"Pour into a pint glass from a 16-ounce can. Beer is very much the color of the can it comes in. I get 2 fingers of head on a relatively aggressive pour. Tight bubbles creating a rocky head of foam. Looks like a 50-50 mixture of pineapple and orange juices. Best looking standard IPA I have seen so far. Nose is straight citrus fruits, again heavy on the orange and the pineapple."
Finished tied for 5/7 in a blind taste test of similar ABV IPAs.
"Picked-up a case at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton for three dollars and eighty cents per can. Just about as good as I imagined. Not sure I would wait 90 minutes & pay $91/case again, but I do love good brew...."
"Canned on 3/21/18; consumed on 3/29/18. Sometimes we live no particular way, but our own."
Canned 3/21/18
Solid IPA.
"Finally drinking Tree House Julius, fresh from the brewery, a can poured into a Church Brew Works shaker. Smells like beer, looks like beer ... Yep, it's a cloudy juicy IPA. One of the originals, or so I have read. This is tastin' really good right now. A fina ale."
"Canned 3/1, drank 3/18. Shipped across the country but otherwise has been cold stored. Served in a Teku glass."
"Quick: pours an grapefruit juice gold with a great amount of haze. Nice small tight head and incredible lacing. Smell was tropical, guava, grapefruit, orange, mango. Then I got a slight grassy hop. Taste follows nose very closely. There is also a sweetness on the finish as it warms that makes the mango come forward. Feel is nice middleweight, with good carbonation, and a nice lingering bitter finish. Well done, this one lives up to the hype. Must get more."
"Julius has to be the most popular beer of Treehouse - definitely has the best smell of any of the Treehouse family and a head that will not quit through the whole consumption of the beer, oh yeah it tastes great too. It has become my daughter's favorite Treehouse beer and it always mysteriously disappears whenever she comes home from teaching at a Massachusetts boarding school. Just gives me another good reason to drive the 40 miles to Treehouse when it is selling the next time!"
Pure gold..can not find anything that tops this delicious beer! 
"Incredible IPA, amazing flavor and feel all around."
"It's fucking beautiful! Soapy head laying atop a hazy golden orange body. Smells subtle if citrus and bitter hops. And boy does that carry into the flavor! Zesty lemon, luscious oranges, and a juicy mouthful of fresh bitter hops. This is the posterboy of what a new England hazy IPA should be!"
"Can at share. Milky, golden pour., small head subsides. Aroma is Belgian yeast, and light citrus. Taste too is light on the palate, juicy, citrus, dries out chalky. Nice feel, not overly sweet or bitter."
"Julius looks like fresh squeezed orange juice ( just a slightly lighter orange) with a fluffy white head that left lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of incredible tropical fruits and orange. Tastes of peach, mango, ripe pineapple, clementines and a hint of sweet malt. Virtually no bitterness. Medium to full bodied, light but lively carbonation, creamy mouth feel. Just an awesome beer that lived up to the hype."
"Poured out a hazy orange gold with a decent head on it. Nose consisted of loads of peach, mango, tropical fruit in general. Taste was similar but had much more complexity to it. Notes of grapefruit also dancing around. Finished with a very nice grassy hop finish. It really wants you to keep drinking, the taste is truly fantastic. Mouthfeel was medium and creamy, felt just right. I understand this beer and it's right up there as a the gold standard for IPA's. I finished this beer without knowing it, it's worth seeking out."
"pours a vibrant hazy orange with a creamy head, looks amazing"
"Super delicious. Surprisingly I don't feel like this one drops off as quick as other IPA's. the guys at treehouse were super nice, and we waited about 2 hours and still got a good amount of beer"
"Canned 2/9/18. Consumed 2/17/18. ""A julius a day"""
Had it a second time and loving it even more. Think I may have had a bad can previously. Nice rich hazy amber color with a creamy two finger head. Bright citrus and grass aromas. Good amount of hops with citrus and cream flavors. A medium body feel with some spice at the end.
"From a can in a tulip glass, hazy, almost looks like diluted orange juice, mango and citrus notes- expectations may have been too high and affected my rating"
16oz can shared with Tim.
"One of the best beers I've ever had. Juicy, fruity, redefining the IPA."
This is one of those beer you can sip and really enjoy without any hint of backlash bite. It goes down so oooh with citrus (orange / grapefruit) tones with a urning for another. Great job with a fantastic finish. One of the best IPAs I’ve ever had for sure.
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pint can on February 2, 2018. Look is bright hazy orange gold with a creamy head and sticky lacing. Smell and taste is mango, peach, passionfruit and citrus. Feel is pillowy soft with a well rounded bitterness. Highly recommended."
"Canned 12/29/17. Pours a beautiful hazy orange in color with a fluffy white head, which retained much longer than I was expecting (NEIPAs have a bad habit of poor head retention). Massive fruity hop aroma with heavy citrus and tropical fruit notes. Flavor is very fruity as well, bursting with new hops and a subtle, slightly bready malt note. I'm usually not big on flavor descriptors, but this had a ton of peach & mango notes. Mouthfeel was pillowy soft with just a bit of dryness. I had high expectations for this and it easily lived up to them. I'd give it a 4.7/5"
"From a 16oz can, dated 01/23/18. 'I don't want a goldfish.' Another popular culture reference, no doubt, that I'm not getting. Anyway. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
"Pours ocompletely opaque darkish orange, 1 finger white foamy head. Aroma- orange, peach, pineapple, hint of grapefruit. Little mint. Taste- All those fruits, and a little hint of biscuit. Really nice fruit juice taste. The taste does not linger. Makes it pretty easy drink8ng actually. Mouthfeel is nice and light and fluffy and silky. Overall- really delicious. Tasty fruit, hardly bitter. It really is tasty and more and more what I crave."
"great ne ipad, juicy orange citrus notes. generally killer ipa. imperieal is king julius but a pain to get. love this brewery but no distrobution makes it a labor of love to get."
"I have to admit, I am an animal. This beer was put into the fridge only 2 hours ago, and it’s still a bit warmish. I couldn’t help it though, don’t judge me."
"Pours a very cloudy bright gold cot with a off-white fluffy head. Aroma is sharp with dank tropical fruit notes, almost winy. Taste is dense with mango and orange juice flavors. Very smooth flavor that sticks around to the finish with no off flavors. Feel is very soft with so.e seltzer behind it. Bitterness is a moderate to low, staying out of the way. Really fantastic NEIPA, worth the legendary status it has attained. A must have for enthusiasts of the style. Wish i could get it more often."
Canned 8/2/17; drank 8/8/17 @ the Yarchives. 
Julius... Finally got my hands on some treehouse legendary beer. So lets see of the hype is real.
"Poured from a can to a 16 oz glass, canned Jan 11. "
The gold standard for NE IPAs.
"Canned 12/29/17. Thick, hazy, juicy appearance much like pulpy orange juice Head is like shaving foam just sitting there on top. Head recedes to a quarter finger and leaves walls of lace behind. "
"Wow, very refreshing. Peach, apricot, orange, pineapple, citrus. Was very happy to try this great brew."
Refreshing
"January 2018, can dated Oct 2017"
"This could just be a classic case of over-hype, but I was expecting so much more from this beer. When sampled side by side with Triple Crossing, Veil, or Trillium beers, it just doesn't stack up. Really an outstanding beer on its own, but I don't think it lives up to the hype."
"16oz can purchased at the brewery after waiting in the most insane line I have ever seen for craft beer, poured into a Tree House pint glass. Super hazy orange color, Smells like juicy citrus and yeast. Flavor is super juicy New England IPA, lots of orange flavor, little bit of yeast or something extra. Nice to finally try one of the originals of the style."
Smells and tastes like a bowl of fresh oranges. Crisp. Not too bitter. A great citrus ipa.
"My favorite American standard IPA so far. Amazing smell and pour, taste of citrus and mango with great hops but no lingering bitterness."
My favorite standard IPA. Julius has been dialed in to perfection. It’s such a soft and sweet IPA. It tastes just like oranges and slight stone fruit. It smells great and has the perfect hazy NEIPA appearance.
The aroma of bright citrus and tropical fruits is unmistakable. No wonder people wait in line for hours in the cold for this reward. 
"Fruit bomb, from the can...cloudy orange and gold in color with a thin white head. Orange/mango/papaya/grapefruit smell. Taste is sweet with mostly mango/orange. Medium carbonation and body. Excellent!"
"Hazy-haze, this cloudy orange beer is awesome looking. two finger off-white head when poured aggressively into tulip glass from 16oz. can dated 12/5/17. Lacing present but not significant. Head hangs a bit but backs off to a film of foam on top. Citrus hits the nose immediately upon cracking the tab. Orange, grapefruit both large notes. Some sweetness to the citrus also, I'm not great at pulling the scent apart, just know it smells great! Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with medium carbonation, it's really exactly what I want it to feel like, perfect to me. There is some bitterness on the finish but nothing to aggressive and it only adds to the depth of this beer. "
"Look: Cloudy, golden orange. Full on haze. One finger of fluffy white head. A little bit of glass lacing when you swirl the beer around. It looks awesome!"
Canned 10/24/17
A: Cloudy orange pour with a large head that sunk over time into a surface ring that stayed till the end.
"Great look, very nice smell especially the day its canned. This is one of the best. "
Aroma: Strong hop aroma - very mellon-y
Best beer I’ve had. Slight edge to this over trillium and heady topper.
"Pours a excellent cloudy orange yellow. Very clear fruity aromas hit the nose as you smell it. Taste is subtle, but quite good and with a smooth finish. Fantastic beer. Would recommend to anyone"
Just really good. Exceptional.
Yum
Quite possibly the best beer ever!
"Enjoyed at a bottle share with some great folks. Poured from a bottle into a small tasting glass. The pour is very hazy and dark gold in color with a nice white head. The nose is one of the best noses I've ever encountered in an IPA. It carries some intense tropical fruit notes. I get the usual suspects (lemon and grapefruit), but also sweet oranges and over-ripe peaches. Awesome stuff."
Thankful to have their new Charlton brewery
Refreshing!
"From a pint at the brewery. The single most beautiful glass of beer I've seen and the most delicious I've tasted. Gorgeous vibrant cloudy orange with thick long lasting head. Full,rounded, balanced robust flavor with the best mouth feel ever!"
"Been dying to try this.... did not disappoint.... amazing aroma, color.... citrus everywhere, and smooth finish.... only downside is I couldn’t get more"
"16 oz, brewery purchase by a buddy a few days ago...11/1/17 canning date"
A: Cloudy almost orange juice like. Decent head.
A: Cloudy orange body. Nice amount of head at first pour that gave way to a slight ring of head and some lacing while drinking the beer. 
Pouring a cold can into a snifter. The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a bleached white creamy head of 1.5cm. The foam fades slowly to a sturdy surface layer and leaves clingy lattice on the sides of my glass after each sip. Some bubbles stick to the bottom of my glass instead of rising to the surface.
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 10/24/17.
16oz can poured Into a tulip
Look- Hazy glass of very beautified full bodied orange
Look - creamy thick tannish orange color with a good sticky white head
Tried this on draft at the brewery and needless to say it's definitely worth the hype. Probably the best beer I've had in years. 
My favorite and most consistent of the tree house. Just overall the most delicious and changes your palate forever
"Pours dark yellow / golden, very hazy with small white head. "
I truly owe my friend Joe for this and all the other TH he picked up for me.
"juice bombs are the diet coke of ipa's. these recipes are prophylactics for wimps who can't handle well-balanced beers. we've gone through the dark ages, the enlightenment, and prohibition only to arrive at a time in history where modern beer drinkers ""desire"" a flat, inoffensive, product. i get that you don't want to feel like you're consuming alcohol. try wine coolers. that's why they exist. congrats on following trends but a plague on your limp originality."
"Pours nicely, decent head, body was a plain. The aroma is quite good. The beer starts with a nice refreshing taste but didn't finish very well. Overall I think it's a bit over rated. I went to Tree House to buy only Julius but purchased some Bright with Citra also and am so happy I did. That beer is really special!"
16oz can poured into a becher canned 9/7/17
"16Oz can dated 9/20/17 purchased at the brewery. A murky peach/pineapple look entices one to drink it. A citrusy hoppy nose leads to a creamy, tasty brew with flavors such as peach, orange, mango and other citrus coming through. If Wine Advocate was reviewing this beer, descriptors such as thick, fruit-bomb, juicy and hedonistic would be used. We agree! Certainly a world-class beer and we feel lucky to have tasted it. Thank You TH."
"Incredible citrus bouquet. Best since Boneyard Hop Venom when in Portland. Mango, Orange, Peach Flavors follow perfectly. Very tight through the middle with very pleasant citrus aftertaste. Thanks to Aaron and Iko for mailing to me after their Labor Day 2017 Boston trip."
This is a great beer. Citrus right from the start and it doesn't stop. Easy drinking as well.
"Excellent IPA. Smooth finish, excellent texture, nice hops. Not overly bitter."
Canned on 11th of May of 2017. Drank on the 20th of September of 2017.
Canned 2 weeks ago and tried alongside a 2-week-old can of Green and a 1-week-old can of DDH Congress St
One of the best yet not over-poweringly so...
Lived up to the hype. From the moment I cracked the can I was hit with hop aroma. This carried from pour to the last drop. Wish I could have this in my fridge every day.
perfection
"Looks and smells incredible upon initial pour. More malt than I expected, albeit not much, tons of notes of oranges, orange peel, and mango. My complaint would be that it doesn't kick me in the face with hops and at times seems to be a bit boozy. The can was packaged that day, so perhaps I should have waited a little longer."
This is currently my favorite IPA. 
"Poored into a tulip glass, this beer is a very murky orange color with 1 finger head. Instantly I get smells of passion fruit, orange/citrus, and pineapple. It has a thick mouthfeel from wheat malt, but the body is very dry and light allowing the fresh citrus notes to shine through with a subtle sweetness. Overall it is a very juicy IPA with very little bitterness and a world class beer"
"A: Poured a murky off orange, almost like super concentrated orange juice. Great head retention, 2 fingers, held a bottle cap on top for 5 minutes while I wrote this."
L - Hazy dark golden orange color with a thick creamy head and lots of lacing
"Pours an orange juice color with loads of turbidity aND haze, nice frothy head that lingers around a long time. Aroma is juicy and sweet, peach and juicy fruit. Smooth and creamy on the mouth, more tropical flavor and no lingering bite. Very nice IPA...top notch but nothing insane."
"Tasted from can. Amazing single IPA. Probably the best I've had. Aroma is huge orange and mango. Very well balanced. Flavors of orange, passionfruit, mango, slight peach and melon. Very drinkable juicy IPA. Incredible!"
Finally got my hands on this beautiful golden joy. 
One of my favorites .
"Fresh can from the brewery. Super excited to get this on the random day I was heading to TH. Pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice. Medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere. Unlike some murky NE IPAs, this remains bright despite being super hazy. Nose is actually not nearly as big as I expected based on what I'd previously heard. Nice orange zest, some tropical notes, and certainly yeastier than I expected. Taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit I get. Plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note. Mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks. Overall, a great beer that didn't quite match the hype but was still a great experience. Delicious burps."
Can thanks to Kevin.
"The most unique of the several TH beers I've had so far. Hazy, bitter etc. as all, but midway through it's soft orange funk. Really flavorful orange."
"16 Oz can, fresh"
"Not quite the nose of haze but still lush. More of a green fruit feel then bursting fruit. Fresh white melon, hints of citrus and cut grass. More of a west coast. Crisp and well balanced."
big hazy ipa. i do like my hoppy beers where i can get at the hop oil as opposed to proactive aggressive yeast. thanks richard for the fresh can hookup.signature th beer.thick lacy.
Just a super drinking experience all around. Great taste.
"Had a few TH beers over the past few months. Great tasting NEIPA with all the fruity tastes one can handle. First one I had was less than 2 weeks old, felt fresh. Second one I had was about 2 months old and felt a little different and not as good as the first but still excellent. They say drink TH within a few weeks. I guess my unintentional experiment shows why."
"They really nailed this one. Pours an impenetrablly hazy orange. Smell is a tropical fruit explosion. Sweet mango, candied orange with something lingering just beyond. Taste is a tart citrus up front followed by a cascade of mango, maybe pineapple and that delightfully sweet orange. My only feel is that it could use a little more tart on the finish. Feel is pillowy and soft, carbonation just right. Overall a beautiful offering from TH. I know they get a lot of hype but ill give credit where credit is due. When fresh this is one heck of a beer."
"My personal favorite beer yet. Treehouse is an amazing brewery, I've had a couple other big names, still waiting on the heavyweights to come around to try, but Julius is by far the best beer I have had to date."
Cloudy straw licit with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is grapefruit citrus. Taste is also a grapefruit citrus and hoppy blend. Overall very good
It's as good as it gets
"Pours a super hazy orange with a nice, fluffy, yet dense foam."
very good.
Great blend of drinkability (especially considering the 6.8% ABV) & complex taste.
"Best nose on a beer, I have ever smelled. Mouthfeel is amazing and the taste of Tangerines and Oranges shine through. Can't wait to try more TH beers!! Amazing."
"Look: Orange, hazy, with two inch head."
a: ultra hazy dark orange amber matte color. 2 finger frothy white head
"This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a lasting one finger white foamy head. Slow dissipation. Thin white speckled lacing. The aroma proceeds to sweet portions of citrus and tropical fruits while allowing a nice subtle crisp resin fresh backbone (in the malt?), seems like to me that the resin in the malt part?, hmmm, interesting. The flavor brings together the hops and the malts to blend fantastically allowing a burst of juicyiness in the full flavor and sliding into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a spectacular sessionability about it. Carbonation seems spot on for the style to allow the bitterness bite down on a great amount of harshness hitting my tongue. Overall, wow, holy crap and a half, New England juicy bitterness bomb, awesome. Definitely would have again."
"If I had never tried other TH regular releases, I would say this is one of my favorite beers of all time. However, after having fresh haze, green and doppelganger, I think there are better, hoppier, more flavorful options at TH - within the regular release lineup. This beer is definitely a juice bomb NEIPA and I would drink it over 95% of beers out there, but it lacks the wow factor that fresh haze and green have when you taste them."
"Beer lover and by no means an expert, so here is my humble opinion. Best. Beer. Ever. This so far has been my favorite beer I have had. Hunt it down and enjoy!"
"Don't get me wrong, this is a tasty IPA. I like hazy IPA's but this just looks like flat orange juice. I've it had within two weeks of canning on several occasions, and have consistently found it under carbonated. IT has some great citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but I can't really get past the mouthfeel with this beer. It simply doesn't deserve the hype it gets, Tree House has several better IPAs."
I was hoping for a touch more on the nose just based on what I've heard about this beer. So take my rating with a grain of salt. Definitely deserves the hype.
"This is a difficult beer to rate. By style guidelines this beer falls on its face for appearance. While not bad to look at, it's a murky orange pour. Can't give it good numbers for that. "
"Had this out of a growler, day of pour. Amazing rich, hazy, golden color. The smell is subtle and not overpowering, definitely fruity notes. mouth feel is very unique - it is dense with slight effervescent feel. The fruity flavor in this one is very much 'orange' vs. the more grapefruit flavor in the 'Haze' from TH."
Purchased and poured from a growler 5/20/17. First time visiting Tree House - that place smells fargin' amazing inside. 
"Light, juicy and refreshing. Loads of melon"
The way Tree House explains this beer is spot on. Truly a great brew.
was gifted this at a bar while geeking out with an awesome woman from MA who was visiting VT - BLESS YOU!! 
"Julius pours a cloudy, hazy orange. On the nose, I picked up pine and tropical citrus fruits. The taste is very citrus and orange juice forward with a bit of the traditional IPA hop bite up front but it slowly gives way to the JPA juice. This is a very complex beer with both citrus fruit and some pine resin working together."
"A juicy orange offering. Served in a special tree house glass. A cloudy orange without much of a head. I think I hyped this up a bit, but it was still awesome. Interested to see how this tastes from the can."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is opaque and yellow/orange/mango in color with two finger thick white head (fairly good retention). Smell is beautiful orange pulp/juice with a nice presence of slightly bitter orange pith. There is a hint of earthy hops/spruce and resin as well. 
"Never thought a beer could get as juicy as this. Like all TH, resembles OJ in a glass. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit, with fluffy soft mouthfeel. Superb palate-coating dankness to this one, with a hint of breadiness on the back end. This beer is unreal, best rated IPA on earth for a reason."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass.
Very solid beer. Alittle underwhelmed because if the hype surrounding this one. Definitely glad I was able to try it and see what all the fuss was about.
Two finger head that clings to the glass pooling into a halo and collecting into a few islands of foam. Aromas of sweet ripe mango and fresh cut pine. Mango purée and an undercurrent of hop resins swirl into a perfect luxeroulsy soft finish. Words aren't sufficient for this beverage. Hall of fame beer.
Pounder Can > Tulip Glass
Flagship.
"A standout beer, great taste, feel, smell, and worth drinking every day. Treehouse characteristics through and through...a beer that everyone should try."
"A very solid beer from treehouse but in my opinion not quite worth all the hype. Smells great of juicy nectar and looks beautiful hazy orange but the feel leaves some to be desired. Or rather the flavor. The great smell doesn't really translate into the flavor as much as I would have expected, I thought it would smack me in the face with flavor but it was rather subdued. The beer would also be way better if it had more carbonation."
"This is such a fine beer my review will not do it justice so I will keep it short. Hazy, orange, sticky head, Smells like orange, mango, weed, and pine. The taste is full of weed and citrus with a nice sweetness and a great piney bite. This is a damn fine beer and the people that can get it regularly are lucky."
Big time want here and first beer from Tree House! Cannot make out the canning date (looks like 3/17) but it tasted fresh.
"EDIT - increased the score... There is just something about this beer that is memorable and will never forget how damn delicious this smells. It lacks depth of a traditional IPA, but it's SO damn tasty. I buy into the hype"
1st time trying - out of can dated 3/8 - so just over a month old
Mouthfeel on this beer is INSANE.
No words
"It's still above all the imitators! Despite the haze, there is no powdery sediment flavor. Cans have been consistent and the formula is really something else. I'd maybe like some more bubbles, but it's otherwise flawless."
Great aroma. Wasn't sure what to expect with this one. Had a fair share of NEIPAs recently and this was one of my top 5 favorites. Wish it was available in PA. Very hard to get
"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew, again."
"Brewed today!!! Poured into a Tree House pub glass. It looks like orange juice with a thick pillowy head. Aroma is tropical juice. Taste like tropical juice. Feels like a fluffy pillow in my mouth. Good lord Tree House, what have you made and why can't I get it on the regular. The hype is understated!"
"Snagged Julius and Green at the brewery yesterday. Cracked Julius the same day it was brewed, after 2-3 hours in the fridge to chill. Pouring it into a pint glass I immediately catch the rich aroma of hops and citrus, which is remarkably potent. Once in the glass the beer is completely opaque."
"This is my ideal NE IPA. When it's fresh, the nose and look set you up with expectations of a real treat, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Full of Orange flavor, choppy without overpowering bitterness. A great experience."
just muddled a bit by a flour like for taste. It's a good beer and no doubt my particular was not the standard bearer for what Julius should be looking forward to trying again soon.
You have heard all the hype. It is real. I got this in a trade in the DC area. Super fresh and juicy. The aroma is strong as soon as you pop it open and the taste backs it up.
Worth the hype!
Poured a cloudy cider/reddish body with minimal head and no lace. The aroma hits me as both citrusy and sweet although the sweetness is all over the place. The beer has little balance as the sweetness (tropical fruit like) lies underneath a dry and bitter hopped body. Pretty good beer that I enjoyed a lot but just a tad off for me.
Great IPA. Still give the nod to Haze as my favorite treehouse. This beer is more amber in color and more of a dank citrusy IPA. almost like an orange juice IPA
"Very drinkable. Wasn't sure I'd like the amount of citrus, but it's really well balanced while being really juicy. Really enjoyed it, especially on tap at the brewery. Was lucky enough to be there on one of there special permit days allowing them to sell full pint pours."
"L: light orange/yellow, very cloudy, thin lacing head, looks just like grapefruit juice "
"Just loved this one. Picked it up yesterday on my first trip out to Treehouse. The smell is incredible. The look is bizarre (like . smoothy) and super cool. The taste is so good. Like they used all of the fruits in a fresh fruit bowl to ferment it and then added millions of orange peels at the very end. I don't get the feel part b/c it's beer. It better feel good in the mouth if it tastes good, right? One of my top 10 beers of all time. I wonder if it tastes this great in the can. Mine was out of a growler."
I can't believe I finally got my hands on one of these! The hype is earned! 
"Canned yesterday...TeKu glass. This beer smells like an orange grove that has been invaded by mangoes, passion fruit and grapefruit. I find that the smell is much more intense out of the can than when poured into a glass. I am already trying to find a way to turn this into a cologne. Looks like a muddled orange, rind and all...hazy to the point I can't see the emblem on the other side of the glass, a signature of Tree House brews, I am learning. A good inch and a half of head that slowly melted away leaving plenty of lacing along the way that just sticks to the side of the glass. Has a slightly sour orange/grapefruit introduction that gradually fades into a more sweet and soft finish, very creamy. Super soft feel, like stuffing a handful of fresh powdery snow in your mouth. If you have to drive over two hours to get your hands on this like I did I have to imagine you are going to be just as satisfied and glad you did as I am. So glad I have 6 more of these patiently waiting for me in my fridge."
"Had a small glass from brother , he shared LOL. Very smooth"
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? The hype is very real, Julius delivers on every aspect, this beer alone could sustain a profitable brewery for a very long time. Julius pours a very beautiful, hazy yellow/orange with about a one inch head. It's about the same color as the can it comes in. Smell is in your face tropical fruits, mango, orange, tangerine, pineapple, a touch of melon. Taste follows the smell, big orange, mango, tangerine flavor, hints of melon, very slight rounded bitterness. An absolute juice bomb. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, very stout-like. Overall it is a very easy drinking, delicious, dare I say sessionable at 6.5% abv..."
"Had this next to an Alter ego.....what a treat and both beers are very similar but this one had the edge imo. The nose promises a juice bomb and the taste delivers it.....its all there, mangoes all over the place.a definite juice bomb worthy of being described as one of the best out there."
"I love everything about this beer. The smell, taste, feel and look of Julius just blow my mind every time I have it. To me this is the greatest beer I have ever tasted. "
Well crafted IPA sweetness and hop bitterness work well together. Nose of orange and citrus for days.
"This has always been my gold standard when it comes to ipas and double ipas. I have had better, but this is a classic beer that I always love coming back to."
"This beer is woefully overrated. You get some pleasant melon on the taste, and then a lot of floral notes without much else. The packaging is the best aspect. I love that logo."
Pours a dark yellow with creamy inch of head. The aroma and taste are are spectacular: mangosteen and passion fruit with a finish of jasmine tea. The body is juicy with a healthy dose of creamy carbonation.
murky yellow orange just like the can. guava mustard passion fruit slight scallion sauerkraut peach. taste is kind of muted. feels full and chewy luscious. not bad i was expecting more from the smell though
Pours a hazy light amber with one and half finger head which is gone in a couple minutes. Awesome lacing though.
A: hazy orange juice sticky laced glass with a massive white frothy head at pour
Canned 2/21/17
"Julius pours a super hazy dark orange/Amber color with a pinky finger of thin foamy bubbles. The aroma is like the first time I drank a orange Julius, aromas of orange juice, orange sherbet, orange peel, mango, apricot and a green basil bitterness... The taste follows the nose with a orange sherbet/juicy fruit gum flavor followed by apricot, mango and a bunch of other tropical fruits....this beer is so soft and creamy, no one does mouth feels like tree house.... They must be wizards!!!!"
Best IPA I have ever had. 
Boy oh boy. That's a really good beer.
Less juice than I anticipated and a rather mellow drink. Obviously amazing
"Oh my God.. Beergasm in a can. How can it get much better than this? Looks great, smells great and taste fuckin fabulous. Must have before you die beer. You won't regret it."
"Canned 1/31/17... ""Stone Cold Crazy"" printed on the bottom. I knew I loved these guys!"
"Pours a cloudy gold with some fizz. Smell is big tangerine, orange, sweet lime, creamsicle. Flavor is fresh squeezed tangerine juice, a bit sweetened up. Texture is soft and wheaty. Great beer."
awesome great beer
poured from 16 oz can into RAR teku. Canned 11-29-2016
Fantastic
I got this as a gift from another brewer on the top beer list so I knew it would be good.
"16oz can, poured into a Tree House Snifter Glass. Enjoyed on 12.19.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"This was the first Tree House Brewing Co. beer I tasted, and I was wowed by its intense citrus aroma and taste. It has a hazy orange color that reflects the inclusion of intense citrus hops. I've never had any other IPA like this one. Over the past year, I've had it many times, and my opinion has not changed. My high rating reflects my willingness to wait in line for an hour at the brewery on their canning days."
"This is probably the best IPA that I've ever had. Such drink-ability! The flavor and the aroma are next level. If you enjoy a good IPA, then you have to try this beer."
"Look: thick white head, beautiful carbination rolling up the sides of the glass, golden orange yellow color "
Poured into a 13 oz Weyerbacher tulip glass canned on 12/22/16. Pours a very hazy orange with a 2 plus finger sticky white head that coats the entire glass with lace.
"I can't really add much to the other reviews, just a phenomenal beer that I'm glad I finally got to try! Juicy, hazy , hoppy deliciousness, hard to beat this one!"
"I'm lucky to live a scenic 50-minute backroad drive from Tree House... Julius consistently lives up to its reputation. Pours into a light golden cloud with a thickness that holds down its froth. Aroma is instantly inviting with tropical fruitiness. It's smooth drinking with pulpy mango juice mouthfeel, but with enough hop foundation to give it a little bite on the tongue. A lively finish that leaves you trying to capture each flavorful note. Makes me want to slow down, think, and appreciate how lucky I am to experience it. The lower ABV makes it hard to say ""no"" to seconds. A beautifully crafted beer."
Spectacular beer.
Cloudy with a good head
"So so drinkable as the label suggests, complex citrus flavors throughout yet creamy and full, not hint of alcohol at any point. Smooth from start to finish one of my favorite TH brews"
The beer you would give a youth soccer team at half time.
"16 oz can, dated 11/29/16, poured into a teku"
Very good IPA but not the best.
"Great overall taste, fruit flavors are more prominent as the beer warms up slightly. Noticeable citrus with the smooth finish."
Bottle Date: growler 12/10/16
"New to this game. Went to tree house yesterday could not believe the atmosphere! Julius is my first tree house. Everything about the beer look, smell, feel are great. Is it bad to say that a 100% rated beer didn't live up to my expectations? Have had beers in CT. that I thought the taste of the beer was better (dose,coriolis). Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough I get that with wine. Curious about different batches if there is a taste differential. Great beer just maybe too much hype?"
"A: hazy golden color, soft lacing"
A: cloudy; a dull medium gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a splotchy cap; very nice lacing;
"Perfect across the board. I don't rate here much anymore but have been having a lot of NE style IPAs lately (lawson, trill, veil, tired hands etc.) and this is one where I'd give a perfect score on the BA scale. Flat out worth the hype and acclaim."
"Description: A hazy, cloudy appearance with a color that is sort of like apple cider but maybe a little lighter. White lacing but not much head. Aroma is full of tropical and citrus flavors (grapefruit, orange, peach) along with floral notes and some pine. Smell is deep and complex with several different layers. The taste is more bitter up front than the smell would indicate and that bitterness carries through to the finish. As it warms more of the fruity, floral notes make an appearance. Candidly, I wish the taste had been more consistent with the aroma. Mouthfeel is rich, velvety and much thicker than a normal IPA."
"worth the wait.....the juice bomb you heard about, more orange or tangerine of the offerings from Tree House, look was spectacular and smell was robust and fruitful, taste - come on what did you hear? well it is true. feel is great a mouthful even though you tend to sip this.....great great great, Tree House is DA bomb"
"For me, this is it!"
From a 16oz. can that has traveled the world better than I. 10-15-16 on the bottom. Poured into a 16 oz. pint glass. We're not wasting time with a tulip glass on this one!
"Look: Hazy, orangish, nice head"
Poured from can into tulip. Served chilled. Less than a week old. 
This is the first beer that showed me the wonders of the NE IPA. Pours kinda thick and sits a hazy yellow orange in the glass. Almost looks like orange juice with a touch of blood orange juice with a ring of head that lingers around the edges and at splotches floating on top. Smell is something unique. Smells of tropical fruit: passion fruit predominates but you also gets notes of guava and mango. The nose on this beer is what really makes it world class; how can you get so much fruit smell with not fruit!? The taste is just generally juicy with a pleasantly bitter finish. Sweet and fruity on the front end with no clear flavor coming through other than tropical punch. Really balanced and not too bitter on the back like some other beers. The body on this beer has heavy gravity that feels thick yet it is not sticky and goes down light and smooth. This is one leg of the Treehouse Triumvirate that really has no clear leader. They are all amazing in their own right and very unique.
Poured into a tulip
First had 8/30/15 at home. Had a friend throw me a can to try out. Its been a love affair ever since. I look forward to visiting the brewery on my way to EBF this February.
16 oz. can
Julius by Tree House vs Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street Trillium. The same freshness.
looks is like a darker orange juice.
"Looks are sublime, as is the reputation for this beer. It pours a completely opaque orange, with a finger of white, tight-laced head. Lacing formation is fantastic, forming spiderweb after spiderweb around the edge of the snifter after each sip. While I hate to use the clique in describing this beer, I really cannot find better words - this beer looks like orange juice. Aroma notes are dripping with citrus and orange. A faint back bone of biscuit malts and pine resin hops support the otherwise Vitamin C-like aroma. Flavor notes are gorgeous, at least a second or so after a sip. Initial flavor notes include a sticky, bitter resin hop, before smoothing out into, you guessed it, citrus and orange hops. The after taste is a lingering, bitter pine resin that sticks around like sap on fingers. The beer really shines mid flavor profile, but otherwise is a bit bitter. Mouth feel is somewhere between strange and great. While the beer itself has a medium to medium-thick texture and consistency, an overwhelming amount of particulates invade and blast the tongue almost like drinking a fine sand - or flour. Otherwise, the mouth feel makes it fun to drink. Overall, it's a well performing beer with plenty going for it. While the initial and lingering flavor notes keep this beer from being an easy first timers IPA, it still is easy to drink. I can only imagine it would be slightly better if it were a few days fresher (it is a week old). "
All Hail Julius! 
"Poured from a 16oz can into a teku glass. Pours a thick, yellow-orange. Opaque like juice. The nose is dominated by mango, papaya, and pineapple. The fruit on the nose is far more tropical and robust than most IPAs, and is accompanied by faint hop background. The palate reveals an exceptional IPA (dank, resinous, and distinctly west-coast) hiding underneath a smoothie-like wall of fruit (with the same flavor notes indicated in the nose). The mouthfeel is thick. Strangely thick for an IPA. This is an incredible way to push the style, and the beer is truly well-crafted. It would be hard for any beer to live up to the hype this one has gotten, and whether or not it does is certainly up for debate. Nonetheless, hype aside, it's a beer that has no trouble standing on its own merits."
"Solid beer, Doppleganger is better"
Picked up the can packed on 10/25/16 at their brewery in Monson. Poured into a snifter glass. 
Thanks @ecoboostinst for the chance to have this.
"Poured from a can gotten via trade from DrunkyBuddha, so extremely pumped to try this beer!"
"Orange-gold and hazy with an off-white, foamy head. Smells like oranges with some biscuit and tropical fruits. At the beginning, it tastes like oranges with a little bit of sourdough tang, tropical and fruity on the back end and a yeasty, bready, orangey aftertaste. Usually I get bitterness early and then acclimate - here the bitterness starts coming out the more you drink it. Medium body, carbonation hits you up front then turns more slick and creamy."
Tree House Julius
L: Exactly what a New England IPA should look like. Personally I don't care for the hazy look but can't fault the style. Nice billowy tangerine head.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned on 9/14/16.
Appearance
"From a can dated 9/14/16 JOHNNY FIVE ALIVE! Pour is murky orange juice. Aroma is slight citrus. Flavor is insane: The flavor is melony citrus; cantelope and honeydew, with a slight booze burn and almost no bitterness, Mouthfeel is perfect. Finish is sweet and clean. Amazing. Beyond impressed."
"So far my favorite from TreeHouse and quite possibly anywhere. Looks like orange juice and the taste is just right. Tons of fruit, smooth as can be. Not bitter at all. Probably my favorite IPA ever."
Sampled TH Green yesterday. Today can of Julius dated 9-30-16. Similarly grapefruity in taste and color but with punchier notes (pineapple?). Very nice citrus smell. Found it to be more rounded than the Green. Smooth and very drinkable. Just the right amount of hoppiness with a slight touch of maltiness. An very well rounded and flavorful libation.
"looks gold/orange and unfiltered as expected, thin head that remains fairly long. smells fruity with a tiny hint of malt, feels extremely refreshing and smooth. taste the fruitiness and malt towards the end of the sip. Wasnt sure if I would buy the hype, but theres simply nothing like a beer from Treehouse."
"Stunning. I lived in western MA for 6 years before stumbling across this dumbfoundingly good IPA. They're out in Monson MA, i.e. the middle of nowhere. Survived the only tornado in western MA in the last 60 years? Worth whatever trip you have to make. Then go visit hill farmstead in St Johnsbury! Can't put to words how good this is, just drink it."
"Either this batch is not their best or the New England reviewers and the brothers are losing sight of what's good. This beer has not lived up to the hype. It's unique but not in all good ways. This batch was made September 27th, 2016."
Just love the looks of these beers. And of course the taste. Easy to see why they are rated so highly.
One of the best beers around. Fantastic IPA
Canned date of 07/19/16
Absolutely fantastic brew. I love New England IPAs. Do yourself a favor and find it ASAP
"Excellent TH offering -typical juice bomb, hazy and delicious. Taste is fruity with a slight hop bite on the finish. Feel creamy despite being rather dry. Evident why this is the flagship IPA."
"Cloudy and believe it or not maybe too fresh, maybe a bit longer to finish"
Tree House is exceptional and Julius is terrific as expected.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a stemed pint glass. 
IPA Perfection. the orange flavor is off the charts.
750 ml growler filled 9-2-2016.
This beer lives up to all of the hype. I never cared for IPAs until I tried this stuff. A true game changer!
This beer is one of those beers that blows your face off of your face the first time and every subsequent time you drink it. 
There is a reason we love Tree House. Maybe it is the place. Maybe it is the branding. Maybe it is because it is hard to get. But probably it is because the beer is incredible. This is a tropical dream. aroma flavor and mouthfeel compliment each other in these mango pineapple notes. It looks like pithy fresh squeezed orange juice smoothie.
I'm on a ratings tear here. 
Julius 
I really liked this one. I have had it a couple of times now. Hoppy with a unique flavor that is fantastic. One of the most unique IPAs that I have had. I can see why this has such a huge following!!
It was a month old but damn it was still tasty
"Can't say enough great things about Treehouse Brewing! Great New England style beer. Super hazy, orange, intense tropical fruit flavors."
Can dated 07/13/16.
Canned 4 days ago. Thanks to my beer drinkering buddy Dave for bringing me back a few cans from TH. 
Look: Haazey orange
"Look : Hazy, a little bit dark orange color and white foamy head."
"This is the perfect IPA. Can't say much more than what has already been said. Orange haze look, perfectly soft and dangerously drinkable mouth feel, juicy orange orangy/mango nose (it is HUGE!) and flavor with light piney bitterness at the end. I'll rock this beer out til' my stock's out. Tru."
"Wow, what a great beer. 5 day old can from brewery. Pours a murky deep orange. Smells like heaven. All citrus, orange, mango and passion fruit. Nice 2 finger head with tight bubbles that stay a bit with nice lacing. Tastes better than it smells. Perfect carbonation. All tropical fruit with a nice malt bill. It's all hops without being killer bitter."
Can Date 8.12 
"Nice head hangs on sides of snifter as it fades. Aroma is great mango, orange, grapefruit and light lime. Taste is Fantastic real fruit bomb. Mango, orange, grapefruit, lime, and passionfruit. With a piney/grassy finish. Thank you chickman. I'll take on the wait in line next time. This beer is excellent."
Simply outstanding
"16 oz. can dated 8/3/16 and humorously has ""Orange You Glad?"" on the bottom with the date. Poured into 18 oz. Belgian ale glass."
"From a can dated 7/19 in a Treehouse Tulip. Pours a glorious, deep, hazy orange, with a substantial, long lingering head. Nose is citrus, melon, with hints of sweet malt. Taste is citrus, melon, combining a massive hop blast with fruity esters. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth. It's a really fine ipa, but despite reputation not my very favorite Treehouse beer, nor, strong as it is, my very favorite ipa. But I've only got one can and my experience with Tree House so far is that ever tasting of one of their beers gives me a fuller appreciation. I'd certainly grab a chance to have this again!"
"Snapped open pint can. Poured into a glass tulip. Date on can was 7/13/16. About two weeks old. Poured a citrus orange haze with about a finger of white head and decent lacing. The aromas of citrus abound making this a tropical cocktail until your first sip, then you realize it's beer! Living up in Pliny country and getting this beer via trading really makes me appreciate the craft at both coastlines. This beer tasted smooth and citrusy and refreshing on a hot California Saturday! Loved every drop!!!"
"Opened a growler of this with a couple buddies to start. Loved it. Switched to some other beers like focal banger, second fiddle, mastermind, sip of sunshine too name a few. Ended on the Julius and was even better than the first glass. Absolutely perfect beer."
"Pours super hazy orange in color with a finger of fluffy white head. Aroma is suprsingly restrained but features tropical fruits and a light crackery malt. Lots of great flavors here, tons of tropical and citrus fruits. I get peach, tangerine, mango, and some melon. Great mouthfeel, pillowy without being too full, very easy to drink. Definitely my favorite of Tree House's staple beers. It has only a hint of the melonly flavor that perceive in their all their NE IPAs that I've had to date; in their other offerings that flavor overwhelms, here it is subtle and helps contribute to the orange creamsicle vibe."
"Julius really is the standard bearer for Tropical New England IPA's. Super hoppy and bursting with exotic fruit flavor, this one is very difficult to beat. Tree House makes consistently great beers and this is their flagship offering."
"Smell is orange citrus, pineapple, general tropical fruit aroma, and a hint of graham cracker. Taste pretty much mirrors the smell, and in line with the ultra juicy ""New England"" IPA style. I know I'm in the minority on this one, but while I enjoyed this beer I thought it was a little over-rated. I thought some of the Aslin beers were of similar quality."
L-Poured from 9 day old can into pint. Pours hazy orange with limited transparency
Yes
"Seriously, how anyone rates this less than a 5 is beyond me!"
"Canned 7/13/16, drank 7/16/16. (UPDATED review: canned 8/2/16, consumed 8/12/16.)"
"Super cloudy, healthy lacing. Dank bitter hop nose. Expecting a big hop punch on the taste, but it's well balanced. Hoppy, citrusy and malty without being overly bitter, really easy to drink. Awesome beer."
"Julius will never get old. Had a week old can yesterday. Beautiful hazy orange pour. Smells juicy with some hop aroma. The taste is a good balance of hoppy bitterness and citrus melon. The mouthfeel is just stunning on this beer. So smooth. Even when at room temperature after sipping on it for a while, this beer still is still amazing."
Opened from can and cosumed on the day it was canned.
Well balanced juicy IPA that represents the style that TH has to offer.
"Perhaps the best IPA I have ever encountered. ""Freakishly drinkable"" is an accurate description."
"Growler from the brewery, pours cloudy orange gold color with a foamy off white head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving excellent foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down."
OK. A bit overhyped. I can taste orange but it is subtle. This drinks better than the Green but not as well as the Alter Ego. Its not as thick as I'd like for an IPA. Ok brew.
"Two fingers of creamy white foam, that slowly settle into about a quarter inch of pillowy goodness. Beautiful opaque orange, almost glows in the sunlight."
Tons of mango and papaya in the aroma and taste. Amazing soft mouthfeel with a very dry finish. I love the mango but it's very one dimensional in that I don't get any other citrus or fruits besides the papaya. Truly a world class beer but this finally decides it for me that trillium is ahead of treehouse.
Had it 4 days old and it was okay... Was expecting more
"Beer was sampled from a can and growler, both less than a week old. Review is from notes."
"I was there when they released the Jjjuliusss for the first time in cans. It was also my first time to TH as well. to be able drink the regular Julius and the Jjjuliusss I suspect might have been a rare ""double"". All in all I liked the J a little better than the Jjj. Not enough to write home about because when both were that good it's like splitting hairs. Wonderful taste, mouth feel and look when I poured into a Tree House glass. Loved the place and will, hopefully get back there."
"Look, this beer is legendary after only a few years. There's no doubt that it's truly unique. I don't think any other beer tastes quite like it. I had my first one back in August of 2015, and while it was very good at the time, I think I let the hype around it build it up to be something that frankly, no beer can be. "
"Very cloudy and rich looking. The color is whitish, dirty gold. Moderate head-- good streaking lace on the glass."
Just made my first trip to Treehouse today. Wednesday is can day and the line moved pretty fast I might say. Took about 25 minus and I was on my way home with 5 Pint cans of Julius and 5 pint cans of doppelgänger. 
"Can 6/7/16 ""The juice turns five"""
"Traded for a can back in April. To this day, still the best IPA I have ever had. Perfectly fruity characters with just the right amount of IPA mixed in. Could never have too much."
"Beautiful orange color. Insanely juicy flavors, especially orange and mango. This beer is everything it's cracked up to be, just an insane IPA. As a homebrewer, I have no clue how they managed this. Note: drank one several weeks later after a road trip, it wasn't close to the same. Get it fresh, drink it fresh!"
Awesome!
"Riding in with much acclaim, the bright and juicy American standard-strength IPA is fabled to boast the perfect medley of orange, mango and passionfruit character from hops alone more so than any thus far. Regardless of any place on a totem pole, excellence is expected."
"Currently my favorite beer in the land. An explosion of taste, texture and aroma like no other!!"
"Have to thank a friend of mine for the hook up. I'll keep it simple Phenomenal beer ! Yes go way out of your way to get it. Looks like orange juice, nose is extremely fruity and taste is the same. Damn near flawless."
Solid but no better than the top trilliums
Revisited 10/31/18
Great!!
A: Hazey and turbid just the way I like them.
Juice Bomb >
"2.5 fingers of fine, white head with pitted, rolling surface. Opaque, pulpy tangerine body."
"This is the best IPA on the planet in my opinion. Julius is a hazy tangerine color with an incredible aroma and an off white finger head that lingers. Taste follows the nose, a tropical bomb of mango, tangerine, with absolute perfect balance. This beer is crushable and a true delight. ."
Awesome
Nice mouthfeel. I am not a huge IPA drinker but I do enjoy everything about Julius.
"Big, juicy, tropical and incredibly complex. Nice three-way balance between malt, hops and citriuos taste. This beer is absolutely superb. The visuals are unspectacular but typical of this style and are quickly overlooked once the taste explosion starts."
"Pours hazy bright yellow orange in color with one inch head. Taste is big jumping citrus. Peach, mango, and orange jump out. Light malty presence to balance the beer out. Super tasty, hoppy, but not super bitter, medium light bodied with moderate carbonation. Like Tree House states, a true joy to drink. My second favorite non-imperial beer by Tree House...only slightly behind Haze."
"100% opaque, Julius looks like peach juice with a large bubbly white spongy head that settles down to a relatively thick, creamy top layer leaving behind a good amount of wavy lace."
"Split a growler with a friend, one day old. First few sips were near perfect, but by the time i got to my second pint a lot of the initial flavors were muted. I know this can happen with any beer, but typically doesn't happen to me with Tree House. Great for one, but not as session-able as I was hoping. "
By far THE best IPA I've had yet!
Best IPA you can buy......
A: Hazy golden; plenty of head. 
"Juicy, citrusy and pungent. The smell almost knocked me over it was so fresh and it tasted exactly how it smelled. Heavenly stuff."
A - nice orange amber hazy color with a big white fluffy head that sticks and leaves great lacing
Excellent in just about every way. Ridiculously drinkable.
Drank a two day old can obtained in person at TH Brewery
"Top notch beer. Delicious tastes of mango and citrus/grapefruit. Very drinkable IPA- low bitterness. Looks golden orange, similar to orange juice. To me it lives up to the hype."
"Pours to a pillowy soft lacy head, Amber in color, grapefruit on the nose, soft mouth feel, I can taste grapefruit mango with hint of orange fruity lingering aftertaste! At times but not always makes my mouth water like no beer ever has!!! Love this beer my obsession right now can't get enough!!!"
This beer is just fantastic as I have had it many times.
Consumed 5/2/16
"Really good, but not even close to top 10 beer in the world. Very cloudy, almost wheat-like. Tropical but almost too much so. It's like an orange juice/IPA blend. Glad I got to try it but for the cost, will not be seeking out again."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a very good, juicy IPA that is very drinkable, it's just not that interesting/complex with the flavor. It's pretty much has all citrus and mango tasting notes with a nice bitter hit of hops that isn't overpowering. Is it the best IPA out there? No. I prefer an IPA that can give you some piney, dank and even sour flavors. Is it the best one dimensional juice bomb of an IPA? Quite possibly."
Canned date 4/12/16
"Had this after drinking swish, alter ego, trillium, and sos over a two day period. Although all were exceptional, this was the standout. Pours hazy and deeper orange than most NE ipa's. Smell is full of mango, melon, lemon, and citrus. One of the more juicier ipas in terms of taste. Feel is spot-on for the style. Medium carb and body."
This beer is an easy 5. There is nothing like it and Treehouse really sets the standard for Juicy IPA's.
Drank a 1 day old Julius picked up from Tree House.
Growler from 4/14/2016.
"I waited in a line for two hours to buy this beer-my expectations were high; disappointment was almost inevitable, but I am happy report that from the first smell to the last swallow, this was one of the best beers I have ever had. Who would have thought hops could produce so a bouquet of aroma. How the heck are these guys so ahead of everyone else-and yes I am talking about Trillium and Nightshift, and even those hallowed brewing concerns in VT. All hail Julius!!!"
"This isn't a beer, it's a gimmick. OK, it is a beer by definition, but it's still a gimmick. The bright fruitiness is infatuating, but lacks the complexities of other beers in the category (American DIPA). "
"As good as it gets... Smell is just absolutely ridiculous. Pour looks like orange juice as many have said. If I had to pick one beer for the rest of my life, not sure I would pick anything over this.... Great job treehouse.."
"The much-ballyhooed Julius. Well, on this site anyway lol. L: hazy orange juice with a bit of muddled brown tones. S: dayum! Smell jumps out at you. Papaya, mango, lots of citrus, sharp hops, hint of sweet malt. T: nice fruit tones, very tropical, plenty of bitterness from hops, nice touch of malt. F: creamy and medium-full. O: excellent."
"Just ridiculously incredible in every way. Looks like a glass of extra pulp orange juice with a ton of lacing. It smells like a tropical fruit smoothy and tastes even better. The mouthfeel is creamy and prefect. It blows my mind that one brewery can make so many perfect beers. This is at the top of the list with king j, doppelganger, and very hazy."
"From a growler, that sat for 1 day."
"L: Yellow to light orange in color, with a bright white head. Pours massive and settles but is easy coaxed out by swirling. Leaves minimal lace. Hazy appearance as well"
"Damn, that passionfruit aroma. Massive juicy fruit with a milder, balanced bitterness. Very hazy, like a hefe. There's a floral character running through with almost a lavender edge. Unlike anything I've ever drank."
Julius is a longtime want of mine. Amazing sweet citrus combined with hops. My one and only complaint is that it's just slightly sweet syrup mouthfeel. Still an incredible beer without a doubt. Real mango here.
"Julius has a lot of head with an orange coloring. There is a fruity and orange smell. The taste is to no surprise is full of orange juice! Overall, I would advise to get this if you *surprise* enjoy orange juice and if you don't; then skip it."
"The flagship! After trying green and alter ego, and blown away by both let's see what this is about. I might make a few comparisons to green and alter ego."
"I love it when a beer lives up the hype and boy does this one do exactly that. It's easily the easiest drinking, hoppy IPA I have ever had. And it truly does look like a glass of OJ. Absolutely world class"
"If you ever reach total enlightenment while you're drinking a beer,"
Had in a growler.... Great beer....strong taste...great flavor
thanks a lot to my brother for sharing this 2 Liter growler with me! I enjoyed this from a taster and willybecker.
"A huge thank you to Matthew for hooking me up with a can of this. Hazy, light orange body with a white head. The aroma...oh my. I actually giggled like a little schoolgirl. And the flavor delivers everything the aroma promised. Juicy, dank, resinous, citric hop character. Beyond delicious, this beer exceeded my lofty expectations. One of the best beverages I have ever had. The best IPA I have ever had. Just wow."
Poured from the can into a snifter. Traded for this and was stoked to finally get one.
"This is my first Tree House beer and I have to say it lives up to the hype. Incredibly hazy from the abundance of hops makes it as opaque as any quality stout. It smells like an orchard of citrus trees. Julius tastes just as it looks almost like orange juice. The flavor profiles for me come in three waves first with the hops up front, then a smooth as silk water, then a slight return of the hops at the end. Extremely complex yet balanced. Julius makes me want to move to Massachusetts. This is my favorite beer of all time. Cheers!"
"Doesn't get much better than this. Pours a hazy orange juice body with a collar of white head. The nose is fruity and drank, tons of mango, peach, nectarine. Taste follows with tropical fruit, passion fruit, peach, and mango are most dominant. Feel is full and creamy. World class IPA, lives up to the hype."
Perfect IPA
16 oz can.
"Julius is a murky, hazy IPA that looks more like Sunny D than beer. The aroma it gives off I daresay is more citrus-forward and juicy than Heady. Flavor is very pleasing notes of orange zest, sweet resinous hops with hints of grass. Very excellent. Smooth mouthfeel, terrific finish. One I could sip for a long, long time."
"Legendarily cloudy and pulpy, with a strong off white head. Good retention, and long thick lines of clingy lacing. Truly opaque."
Passion fruit bomb. Best IPA I have ever had
"Can shared by Curran last night, thanks man."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. I wish I cold give it like a 4.90 because King Julius to me was slightly better but a double ipa. This beer was one of the first hyped beers I ever had that lived up to it. Smells good, has a nice juicy hoppy bite but smooth as silk. Enjoy and definitely try this at least once. And if you don't like it, try it twice in case you got a bad batch."
Growler filled 2/16/17. Enjoyed 2/18/17.
"you know, its a pretty cool surprise when your friend scores one of these, doesnt know what it is, and then after finding out, wants to open it right up and share it. thanks to claystation for making this friday a special one. a pint can poured into a pair of mason jars (in the parking lot at a golf course). its milky and more than hazy, downright thick with sediment, looks under attenuated and weirdly greenish orange under a two inch bubble cushion of pure white. it would be unattractive by ipa standards if i wasnt so used to the vermont style ipas. the nose is fantastic, really fruity punchy, with mango and orange for sure, smells like fresh juice, really awesome hop profile to it. is it mosaic in here or what? the taste matches the nose, i was happy to see the vibrant nature of the hops carry over. its super fresh tasting, and aggressive as they go, packing some bitterness to back it up. the grain doesnt seem to contribute anything too unique on the flavor, maybe a pinch of wheat in here, it has some real full body, but isnt heavy in any way thanks to its radiant carbonation. i taste it for a long time after its gone too, bitter hops and orange zest on my palate all day. now, this is pretty special ipa, some really top level suds, but is it the tenth best beer in the world as its listed here on BA? im not so sure. i liked their alter ego even better than this one, and wonder how much high marks come from hype. dont get me wrong, its amazing, but is it way better than so many other forgotten india pales not on this list? not in my humble opinion. thanks again to claystation for making this rarity (in colorado) a reality!"
"Growler shared with the fellas at HamTech Reunion 2014 - Clinton, NY. Pours hazy gold with a white foam top. Rich fruits abound with lots of the tropical stuff, melon, tangerine and orange. Not too bitter, fairly sweet. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Juicy and rich but still well rounded. Really juicy on the finish with some honey, pale bread, lots more melon and tasty citrus. Just loads of expressive fruit character in here. Wonderful."
"can dated 3/8 - 9 days old. poured hazy, light orange, white head. great citrus aroma. flavor is full of beautiful hops but not overly bitter at all. juicy and crushable. mouthfeel, to me, is what separates this from many of the others. so hard for me to crown ""the best ipa""...like picking a favorite child. but it's there among the elite."
"Looks like OJ, smells like OJ, taste like OJ...amazing"
"World class. Best IPA I've ever had. A step above Sip, G-Bot and Captain's Daughter. "
"drank this on saturday and was overwhelmed with what i tasted.... beautiful aroma and flavors, super easy to drink and probably the best AIPA out right now, in my opinion, and of my short scope of tastings.... so many great IPAs coming out right now it's unbelievable."
"Really great IPA, but not what I expected. May have had a little age on the can or just not my thing I'm not sure. Poured a hazy gold as you would expect a non-filtered IPA to pour and had a slight citrusy aroma to it. Had a great mouthfeel and flavor was on point for sure. May have just been the hype getting to me"
"I'm going to have to fall into the minority on this one. I prefer Haze or Green to Julius. Having said that, this is Treehouse. Julius is better than almost any other AIPA out there."
"Unfiltered pour. Thick orange color. Smells of passion fruit, mango, orange and citra hops. Super smooth on the palate, but a little too fruity for me. I'm not a huge fan of passion fruit or mango, and it's overpowering. Not necessarily a bad thing, unless you're not a huge fan of passion fruit/mango. I've read other reviews who claim it's not super juicy, and it most certainly is."
"Orange yellow cloudy mess, in a good way. Not as ugly as Heady Topper. Two finger off white cloud, long lasting. Sticky lacing."
"Fruity flavor blasts, great hop kick. AWESOME beer."
Poured into a tall tulip about a week and a half after purchasing at the brewery. Consumed after a swordfish dinner. 
"Enjoyed in a tall glass from the can, date of canning was mid february so it was enjoyed fresh. "
"A friend picked up a growler from the brewery: this is the first of their beers that I have had. It lived up to the hype: this is an excellent IPA. It pours an orangish color with a nice head on it. Nice nose. It’s fairly hoppy, with orange and tropical notes. The taste is also quite good. Lots of tropical and orange hoppy flavors. A faint sweetness from the malt body. Very smooth. A very nice beer. Edit: Have had the canned version now too. It is equally good!"
Superbly well-balanced drinkability. Great anytime of the day including breakfast. Amazing citrus flavors.
Absolute perfection. May be the best beer I've ever had.
My thanks to @FFreak for bring me a couple cans.
"My brother in law pickup a few cans near his house outstanding beer , very hard to get your hands on.truly a special brew"
A marvelous unfiltered orange look and a lovely juicy citrus on the nose. It is even more pronounced in the taste and as it warms a mango flavor emerges that nestles nicely in the citrus. I would believe that there is actual fruit juice in here and the mouth feel is complete like a glass of orange juice. At the edges of you tongue the mango drops off into a hint of bubble gum flavor. Best IPA I have ever had.
"WOW. So hazy, citrusy and delicious. An absolute treat of an IPA, that is well worth the hype that it receives. The name serves it well. Canned on 2/11/16"
Canned on 24Feb 2016 and enjoyed the same day. Poured into a Duvel Tulip. 
"This beer pours a turbid burnt orange with a 2 finger fluffy off white head. Retention is excellent and there are massively thick sheets of lacing everywhere. The smell is a fruit juice bomb. Aromas of mango, pineapple, grapefruit and most notably orange burst out of the glass and engulf the senses. There is also a slight dankness. Taste is exactly the same. Feel is light side of medium and just so pillowy soft, juicy and drinkable. The dankness shows up on the back end, but there is barely any of the bitterness you would expect to go with it. Overall absolutely world class. Next level IPA."
"A very well balanced IPA. I've had plenty of Treehouse brews and actually never tried Julius until well after I've tried some of their others. For this batch, I'm not getting the crazy citrus that is described as in other reviews of Julius. Rather, I'm getting a dank, smooth hoppiness that is quite drinkable, and not bitter at all. Very delicious."
"I like to think of Dr. J like the Kool Aid guy. Everyone wants it, and when it smashes through the front of your house, it doesn't even matter because it makes your day better. Color and smell make your mouth water, taste doesn't let you down either, superior drinkability. Delicious."
"As far as those Juicy DIPAs, this is it. I can't imagine what King Julius tastes like as the prince himself was that damn good. Beautiful orange color, great smell, best taste and mouthfeel."
"This is obscenely delicious, if it counts as a pale ale i guess. Beyond juicy, and zero transparency, an amazing nose and a wonderful yet light body. Meets hype. I can see why people call it watery, and too light on flavor, because it is. But this is the new style. Again, almost unfair to call it a pale ale by the classic definition"
"Pours a gravy-like, pale orange color. Develops a foamy 1/2 inch caps of suds, that sticks around for several minutes. I rated the appearance pretty high just because of what it is. Most IPAs would suffer with this appearance but being one of the new crops of NEIPAs, I think ti fits the part better than many. The aroma is very hop forward. To my nose, the overwhelming aroma is freshly peeled orange. But there are a lot of delicious fruity notes in addition. One might call them ""tropical"" but I can't put my finger on one specific fruit. Either way, this has very juicy and mouth watering aroma. The flavor is, well, orange juice. Well, more complex than orange juice really, but it is very reminiscent of the delicious breakfast beverage. It does have a nice citrus quality and an almost spicy character. There is a bitterness, but it pretty much drops off the palate immediately, mostly just serving to balance the overall fruity character of the beer.The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It has a lot more body than your typical West Coast IPA, though not ""thick"" by any means. Quite a unique mouthfeel for IPAs in general yet really bring home that ""juicy"" quality. Overall, just an awesome and fairly unique beer, one I would drink on the reg, if possible."
"My first Tree House Brewery beer and review. Very curious over the hype on this brewery and was lucky enough to score a can in Nashville, Tn! Pint can dated 01-21-16 so not quite a month old."
L - evenly opaque orange
Probably the best IPA I've had. Definitely the most unique. Super balanced. Hazy orange. Very fragrant mango and citrus. 
"Bottom Line: If you get this fresh from the brewery (either growler or can), it is absolutely worth the hype. Most of the aspects of this beer have already been well covered below. A few thoughts: Don't be in a hurry with this one - some of the more subtle fruit flavors like peach come out as it warms up a bit. Perhaps what I like most is the balance between citrus/fruit flavors and the hoppy bitterness --nicely proportioned. If I had to choose only one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it (although still need to try Tree House's King Julius and Juice Machine)."
Out of a fresh can. Pours an orange hazy color with a thin white lacy head. Flavor is all candied orange. My second favorite beer from these guys!
"This is an exceptional beer. Pours a perfect orange color with thin lacy head. Flavor is full of candied citrus fruits. Mouthfeel is probably the weakest point of the beer, but we are really nitpicking here. Cheers!"
Big on the plush fruits and hazy body - lots of juice with a malty enough base to even suggest some chew. A really delicious brew that deserves a rank with many of the best. Certainly not something you pass up on if you haven't tried.
Surprisingly delicious and not overpoweringly hoppy like many IPAs. Definite citrus flavor and smell. Quite refreshing and not overly dry or bitter.
"Appearance: Pours opaque golden rod, small white cap good lacing."
"Had a sample of this on line over at Other Half back in the middle of the winter on a freezing day and finally got around to having a full can of this tonight. Traded for it in New York and yes, this was a bit old with a date of 4/12 on the bottom of the can. Thankfully, this aged well and still tasted fresh as there wasn't anything dank, skunked, or wretched to this with the added bonus of no floaties when I held this up to the light. Already ahead of the game before I took a sip!"
A - Opaque orange color with a thin white lacing ring. 
12/21/15 batch still going strong
Thanks Steve!
My first Tree House beer. Pretty much lived up to the hype. Smelled delicious and tasted the same. Too bad west coasters have a hard time getting this.
pours dark orange. hazy w nice lacing as the beer gets drank. nose of tropical fruits orange tangerine . taste is up front juice w mid and late palate gives way to light fruit like mango and papaya? taste lingers w bitterness going on long after sip had been complete. overall this is a great beer. personally I like most other treehouse better. to orangy for me. but would take over must other beers.
A: Hazy yellow/orange. Nice head great lacing
I honestly.... was let down by this beer. 
"As many times as I've heard people say it's like orange juice, nothing really prepared you for such a juicy onslaught of hops! I just wish it was easier to get. Nice and cloudy all citrus and hops on the nose and on the tongue."
"Great orange and citrus flavors, passion fruit, bubblegum, and resinous hops add light bitterness from start to finish. Excellent mouth feel, so full for an IPA. This is worth the hype."
A - Cloudy orange body with a decent white head. Leaves moderate lacing. 
"I've had heady, SOS, Fuzzy baby ducks etc. Julius tops them all!"
Mango creamsicle
Not a real technical review but here goes.
The best IPA I have ever had. Juicy goodness!
"Poured from the can into a pint glass. Intense citrus aroma starts as soon as it's cracked. Pours hazy with generous foam that slowly dissipates into fine skim. Obviously, orange citrus is the primary flavor, but it's tempered by dank, resinous hop profile. Very crisp with enough malt backbone to remind you it's not juice, just juicy. Mid-level abv means you can have a couple, if you can find them. About as good as it gets."
Ridiculously awesome.
Everything I want in a beer. All the flavors are there and the balance is perfect. Tropical fruit explosion. So damn tasty. Love this beer.
Could drink it every day!
Very fruity and refreshing. Tree House makes good beer.
"God damn. I've had Julius on roughly 10 different occasions to this point and it has never tasted as good as this one tastes right now. It's roughly 3 weeks old, canned on new year's eve, and it's damn near transcendent. Definitely one of if not THE best IPA I've ever had. As soon as you start pouring, the aroma hits you like a ton of bricks: orange, pineapple, mango, fruity as fuck, with a little bit of bubble gum too. Taste starts with that yeasty bubble gum, like juicy fruit, follows mid-palate with the aforementioned fruits, and finishes with a soft bitterness - more of a dryness really. This thing is a straight up juice bomb, but it never crosses into that slightly too-sweet territory that I feel like the Grimm IPAs frequently do: that bitter finish keeps it from tasting too much like Orangina, which is a good thing. The bubble gum thing is a bit odd - adds kind of a hefeweizen feel - but it's not off-putting at all, and kind of acts as a Tree House calling card. Overall this beer is just flat-out delicious. The hype is absolutely justified."
"Poured into a Teku snifter glass with a solid two fingers of head from a can dated just shy of 30 days. Color is a turbid dark orange reminiscent of oxidized pineapple juice. Aroma is like burying your nose in hop pellets—intense. Contrary to the noted citrus, I'm getting more pine and resin with hints of candied orange peel and ripe honeydew. Taste is lush and full bodied, but the hop presence remains front and center. Flavor notes of clementine, and citrus juice, but that pithy hop presence is consistent and astringent, even against the backdrop of malt. Overall, I've had this twice from the same batch and felt the hop presence on this one backed off from the stronger citrus hop notes from a can two weeks fresher."
"Absolutely a top notch IPA, rich citrus hops with endless drinkability."
Opaque dark orange color. Head lingers and leaves nice lacing. Smell is fresh citrus fruit especially orange. Taste is very bright citrus hops with a uncommon smoothness to entirety of the beer. The hop flavor is massively intense but it's delivered so masterfully here the beer goes down fast. Unbelievablely drinkable.
"Going to start this off by saying I was slightly underwhelmed with all the hype behind Julius and Green, by no means were these bad beers they just have been overhyped and like most things the hype is usually greater than the final product. First off the nose of this was an absolute citrus bomb, tons of orange, grapefruit, orange pith, just citrus fruit. I dont know who had to sell their soul to the devil because I dont understand how treehouse makes their beers have a mouth feel this good. Taste similarly follows the nose but not as juice bomb as I have experienced with some of treehouse or trilliums other beers. Good malt bill but not as much hop bite as I would like. Outstanding beer but I do believe its overhyped."
So good when fresh
"About the perfect blend of beer and juice, if that is possible. Looks like light orange juice, smell and taste are a juicy hop balance. Tried this alongside King Julius and actually prefer this one, as the lower alcohol taste makes this much more drinkable. With juicy IPAs and coffee/maple stouts, maybe beer is trying to take over breakfast now?"
Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip
Pours out looking like its some sort of tropical fruit drink.
"This pretty much fits all the expected standards of a good modern IPA. Citrusy, fresh, dank..."
"Light, foamy, airy, and... peachy? "
Tried Julius with a friend after trading SoS.. First brew from Tree House and did not disappoint.
"A- Just like Alter Ego, this IPA pours a stunningly bright orange in color and extremely hazy in the glass. Again, it basically just looks like orange juice in the glass. A big and dense head of about 3 fingers thickness forms and never goes away, leaving a solid wall of lace down the glass."
More about the hype then anything else
16 oz can poured into Teku glass. Canned 1/6/16 and consumed 1/6/16.
Another solid IPA from Tree House. Green is my favorite but is very close. I really love the sweet mango and citrus taste to this beer. It has a subtle malt and creamy finish. This is along with green will be a constant addition to my IPA inventory. My favorite brewery right now.
"16oz can, sample from the brewery. "
"Not the best Treehouse beer I've had but still outstanding. Slightly overhyped in my opening but still a world class IPA. Name speaks for its self, tons of citrus, orange. Grapefruit, pithy citrus. Aroma like all treehouse beers is off the chain. But what makes this and all treehouse hoppy beer insanely good is the crazy haze and mouth feel."
Can into tulip. 12/21/15. Yippie ki yay 
"Had a fresh one canned 12/31/15 and marked ""Merry New Year"" along with the date! Was my second TH (After Green). Great lacing and amazing aromas. Taste was a little too sweet for me and I ended up liking the Green better. Great great brew nonetheless. TH knows its stuff and wish I was living nearer. Lots of candied orange on the taste with mild bitterness like grapefruit peel."
"Another fine east coast style IPA. I've only been lucky enough to try a few brews from Treehouse but they have all lived up to the hype. This one does as well. Nice hop hit up front but a little more subdued than some others. Wonderful fruity flavor throughout with nice mouth feel. Very tasty brew. Not the best I've had, but a great brew that I will seek out in the future. Cheers"
"Look - Hazy orange. Not too dark... or as my buddy put it ""not murky"""
"Fruity or as those who've had it call it ""a juicy IPA"". Juicy flavor explodes on your taste buds. You can still taste the hops. Great texture. One of the best from my favorite brewery."
"To start off, I want to say this beer is in my top 3 beers of all time. Im pouring a fresh can into a HF tulip glass, the head is off white creamy and settles down to a very rich lacing. The nose is just pure tropical juice and bright fresh hops. I smell more of an orange/tangerine than the typical grapefruit. The color is an unfiltered hazy opaque orange. The taste is definite tropical fruit with some pine coming through. I can tell there is a massive amount of hops in the whirlpool and dry hop bill. Being unfiltered the mouthfeel is just awesome. Really creamy and has a rich feel as it goes to the back of the palate. As soon as I swallow a sip I have to have another one. Overall, this is a beer which is a must have for anyone who proclaims themselves a hop head! Hands down one of the best Ive ever had. That's a big statement."
"16 oz can, packaged on 10/27/15. ""Live wild"" on the bottom of the can."
"The orange flavor is less my thing, as I prefer the resin flavor profile, but this is a great beer that does this to the fullest. Cloudy haze, with a refreshing mouthfeel."
"So much peach, mango, & passion fruit in a fully-hopped IPA. Wow. Incredible balance. Canned yesterday!"
Awesome beer. This pours so thick and cloudy like orange juice with tons of hops and citrus on the nose. I drank this within 2 weeks of canning and it made a difference for sure. Tons of happiness and great flavors all around.
"I hadn't been to Tree House since they stopping by their original location a few times a few years back, until I had a chance to stop by while in western Mass today. I picked up some cans of Julius, canned today, and opened one right when I got home--doesn't get much fresher than that."
Another Great Brew from Tree House. Love the Beer and the Brewery.
"Really nice IPA, prefer alter ego and green,, but this one is straight orange juice, very nice would drink anytime!"
"Poured a 12/9/15 16 oz. can into a tulip glass. Pours out a cloudy orange color with a thick off white foamy head. Aroma was a bit subdued, was expecting more but what I did get was all tropical fruit hints. Taste was all tropical citrus flavors and finished so smooth like drinking a carbonated tropical juice drink. Only negative was the lack of bitter bite, otherwise a great great beer. Mouth feel was incredible, silky but somewhat thick and smooth. Overall, great beer but was expecting a bit more."
This is one of the best IPAs (and beers) out there. There is so much citrus from the hops but there is a huge presence of biscuit from the malt. It's hard to believe this beer is only 6.8%. Well done Tree House. This beer is worth actively seeking out.
Look - golden haze that has an inch of foam. 
Obvious hints of citrus to the nose immediately. Citrus/Hoppy blend almost to perfection. VERY enjoyable!
"A massive thanks to Pearpicker for this generous gift. I don't ever drink canned beers nor do I like them, but when someone's gives you a Julius, you can't ignore that. So here goes my first canned review..."
Best overall IPA I have tasted. Nice balance of hoppiness and tropical fruit/orange taste and ABV is just right.
"Deep gold in color with a fair amount of heads that settled to about an 1/8"". Lacing is moderate to heavy as the beer was consumed."
Its that good
Pours an unfiltered cloudy papaya color. Has a great aroma of tropical fruit and citrus. Flavor is bright and hoppy. Notes of passion fruit and citrus. Has a slightly bitter hop aftertaste with a smooth clean mouthfeel. Overall this is super delicious.
The top IPA in the country and for a damn good reason.
Canned 11-23-15
Pours cloudy light orange with a small white head. Love it.
"Looks like a hefeweizen. Nose is decent. But cot' dam' it tastes good. All the dank hop bite but very little bitterness. Smooth, with citrus notes."
Imagine a mist of pure aromatic mango and passion fruit hops with some orange scattered about.
quite possibly the best IPA I've ever had. Cloudy color with nice fruity aroma. taste great on the tongue with slightly hoppy finish..
"Finally get to try the pinnacle of Tree House beers. Shared a can with my brother. Pours a cloudy orange, amazing aroma. Taste reminds me of Heady. A little more bitter in finish than desired."
Many thanks to Kegatron for the share on this pounder can. Heard lots of good things and was excited to try this freshy last month. It appears a chalky orange color with white head that fades leaving stringy lace.
Glowing orange opaque smoothie like color
WOW. Lucky enough to have a friend share a can with me. Magnificent IPA. 
Look: Holy haze! Never seen a non-homebrew this thick
"Thick, hazy, beautiful pour and a refreshing taste make Julius a real delight to drink"
Look : Thick murky orangish yellow
"Opened another can of Julius to enjoy during the football game. The smell is a fantastic mixture of orange and apricot. The look is that of a orange-red-brown and slightly cloudy with micro bubbles. The taste is a perfect, juicy, complex smack to the taste buds and its drinkability is making it difficult to save any in the fridge for another day. One of my favorites."
16oz. can poured into 16oz. CLBC/Jameson snifter
"Poured 11/28/15 from a 64oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 11/27/15, into a large mug glass."
Amazing beer. Notes of tangerine and grapefruit. How up front and it sweetens right out with long finish.
"Thank you, Patrick. Canned 11/05. "
16oz Can!
"This is one juicy IPA! Loved this beer, for being an IPA it was super easy to drink, perfect amount of hops and bitterness. Poured a cloudy burnt orange color; smelled of citrus, orange, tropical fruits; tasted amazing! Had bits of mango, orange, and grapefruit taste. Everything about this beer is perfect! I need more Tree House in my life!"
Service: Bottle
Cracked open a can and poured into a Tree House tulip. 
Hazy golden orange color. Beige head. Lace. 
"You'd be hard pressed to come up with a better, more succinct and appropriate name for this beer than Julius. Children of the 80s like myself will harken back to the flavor of Orange Julius when trying this beer. In short, it is god damn amazing. "
"Juicy, that is all i can say. Amazing beer, nose is fruity and tropical, mango comes out beautifully. Taste is fruity with almost not bite from the bitterness, just hoppy and orange and mango. Absolutely fantastic"
What a juicy amazing IPA
Perfection.
"Tried this the second time fresh (3 days after canning). Much better this time. Dark hazy orange color. Great blend of citrus smell and flavors. Subtle fruit aftertaste. Light carbonation, easy to drink without the heavy bitterness of a typical IPA. Excellent IPA from Tree House. I will be enjoying this over the next couple weeks."
750ml growler (11/14/15) into a Tree House teku. Shared with schen9303. 
"Fantastic! As soon as you open the can, you get that citrusy/mango aroma and the taste is just as good. Very smooth for an IPA. Mine of the best beers I've had"
"Fresh can -poured into glass. Appearance is hazy orange with fluffy white head, and decent lacing. Smell is amazing, orange, apricot and mango. Taste is very juicy and tropical orange and mango, with nice hoppy finish. I don't get much bitter grapefruit taste so it seems sweeter than most IPA's. Feels very creamy and juicy. Overall, a great IPA that rivals the best I've had, but with a unique take on the style."
"Pours a murky dark orange. It doesn't get by on its looks, but it does have nice fluffy off white head. Faint aroma of melon. Definitely get a lot of melon, honey, and honey dew in the taste. A little bit of papaya and bitterness on the finish. Flavor is a bit underwhelming and lacks some of the juicy intensity that I enjoy, but it has a very nice soft mouthfeel. Overall, I like Julius, but it's far from the best IPA I've had and it's definitely not the best beer I've had from Tree House."
Awesome sauce
"Alright. The IPA at the top of the heap for the moment. So stoked to be able to try this. After several cans, I think I'm ready to sketch some thoughts."
Canned 11/4/15. A week old.
Soooo good. Complex enough to satisfy a hankering for awesome-ness and yummy enough to drink a whole bunch. My wife even likes it.
"Had a can of this for the first time last night. It was a really good beer but not mind blowing by any means. I still prefer Heady, SOS, Pliny and Hopslam to this. That said, I'd definitely drink it again if I came across it but I won't go out of my way to trade for it again. Looking forward to trying the other TH beers though."
Orange Julius
"An overall great beer. The hazy, opaque look is fantastic, and the aroma is pungently pleasing. Flavor is very tropical fruit -- different than Heady which has more of a grapefruit character (nd which I prefer). Still really delicious. 7% ABV drinks like 4% -- outrageously smooth. The Tree House boys definitely know how to brew."
A - Pours a bright hazy orange with limited foam
"This is the perfect IPA in my view. It takes a couple of cans to truly appreciate this brew because I initially thought it didn't live up to the hype after the first can/sip. And this is partly due to its complexity. I love the fruit in this but what separates this beer from the rest is the herbal character. You almost feel healthy drinking this. Go drink this before Tree House expands further and, God forbid, something changes about this beer (knock on wood)."
"pours a beautiful orange murky color. decent head retention. smell is very very juicy and tropical. pretty much how the can describes it: oranges, peaches, mangos, plus im getting a hint of bubblegum. taste matches the smell perfectly. big blast of citrus and tropical juice, but rounds off very nicely into bubblegum and peaches. feel is spot on perfect, perfect carbonation, and dry despite the amount of juiciness. knock out brew from Tree House, glad I got a hold of this."
"Very good beer, but slightly overrated IMO. It's definitely top notch, but I think overhyped. Epiphany, to me, is a better version of Julius. Both a great though."
"Stupid amounts of citrus make for a complex and well rounded offering. Hazy with a perfectly balanced mouthfeel. Even next to Haze, this is one ridiculous punch-you-in-the-face-over-the-top-flavor beer. Can't compare this to any other IPA I've had."
"One of the most memorable beers I've ever tasted; the flavor profile of oranges and grapefruit is incredibly distinctive. Also a drop-dead gorgeous beer to behold in the glass (bright orange!). Fantastic offering by Treehouse, and completely worthy of the hype."
Poured from a week old can into a teku:
"This beer, at less than 7% ABV, is reminiscient of some of my favorite double IPAs, namely Dinner and Sunshine. Hoppy, citrusy and smooth; I ended up finishing the can (via pint glass) much faster than I expected as it is really smooth and drinkable. I think I like this more than the other TH beers I've tried, though I've loved them all. They really cater to my palate, I need to visit that place... a growler filled with Julius... a short drive to Maple Hill disc golf, that'd be a perfect Saturday."
poured from a can dated 2/9/2018 into 12oz snifter glass..what needs to be said about this beer that hasn't already been said?
"This is absolutely hands down one of the top beers i have ever had....explodes with a hoppy aroma when opened. Looks pillowy orange on pour, tastes unlike any beer i have ever had. Can taste citrus, peach and other fruit like flavors. Feels smooth, pillowy and velvety. Overall absolutely delicious!!!"
"Great beer! A friend brought it to me at work witch was a wonderful surprise. It was canned just around a week before opening. I got great grapefruit notes off the nose which I really enjoyed. All in all a great beer which I was super happy about, cheers !"
"I have enjoyed many of the hyped up IPA and DIPA. This beer is the bomb! Massive amounts of tropical fruit in the nose and taste (from Citra hops I suspect). Peach, Mango, and grapefruit juicy dankness are the flavors that bust through. Smooth, creamy feel to accompany this, but does finish a bit less hoppy than what I would like. I drank first out of the can, but if you pour, deep orange hazy color. IMO, one of the best IPA's that I have ever had. The only thing I would say would make it better would be a little more ABV (its at 6.8, but a nice 8 like Sip of Sunshine would rule), Regardless, top notch for the style and I could drink this for the rest of my life. Cheers!!"
"I mean, you can knock it for having the haze it does, but if you're looking to appearance for what to expect, it's exactly what it should be!"
Not many beers live up to the hype. Julius does!
From a 16oz can into a teku glass. Can dated 10-6-15 so exactly 2 weeks old. 
I finally got the Juluis.... Wuuu huuuu!!
"16 oz can. Pours turbid milky orange, finger head fades to a thin layer, lots of lace. Super juicy aroma, oranges and ripe tropical fruit, wow. Taste is just as juicy and fruity. The juicyness fades faster than I'd like to a dry piney earthy finish. I'll soft mouthfeel. Up front this brew was through the roof, finishing a little flat but overall outstanding."
"3rd try, once from a growler and twice from a can. This batch 10/6. Pours an opaque peachy, vitamin water color with 1/2 finger of tan head and nice lacing. Smell bursts with tropical fruit, peach, mango and passion fruit. Taste is more carbonated fresh squeezed orange/pineapple juice and less tropical/mango. Not world class for sure but certainly very good."
From a tallboy can into a Belgian tulip.
"Canned 10/6, consumed 10/17. As fresh as a Californian is going to get this bad boy..."
Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter. Bottom of can says 10 06 15.
Look - Looks like orange juice in the glass! WOW! Haze for days. 
"This was an absolute outstanding brew. Smelled of citrus, pineapples, oranges, mangoes and a little apricots. Taste was smooth and packed with punch. Mouthfeel was very good and finished with light bitterness. An absolutely great beer. Would drink over and over again."
"Color on this one is orangish brown, with perhaps a green tinge, like all the TH IPA's I've seen, its very hazy and pours a solid two fingers of head that retains beautifully aroma is a burst of citrus, taste is oranges and tangerines, with a hint of subtle, peppery spiciness. Nice biscuiy malt supporting the complex hops. No booze whatsoever. Bravo"
"One of the best beers I've ever had. Amazing citrus aroma, clean hoppy taste, perfect amount of bitterness and a ridiculously smooth and creamy body. Granted, this comes from a can literally off the line yesterday so it's unreal fresh. The aroma and taste are very assertive but it's the smoothness and ease of drinking that sets it apart from all other IPAs. Hits the sweet spot of being dank, tropical, almost juicy in its fruit flavor, with the lightest kiss of malt to prevent the taste from being sticky. Drinks and finishes so crisp without a resiny or bitter aftertaste that when you're done with a sip, you're done; the beer doesn't overwhelm the palette. Balance is its greatest virtue. World class."
Along the lines of a heady. Similar nose and after. A very very very good IPA.
hazey golden nectar poured from the can. Reeks of orange juice and zest. beautiful bright hop aroma followed buy a juicy flavor that keeps you wanting more. Nice medium bodied almost creamy mouth feel. This is a beer worth seeking out. The hype is very real for this beer.
"Excellent. But not world class. Yes, I would agree it indeed smells and tastes like orange juice in the beer form. Very earthy. Feel is top notch."
"Looks like tropicana. Smells intensely citrus/tropical fruits. Taste is is too bitter for my taste, with the good elements of the smell falling a bit to the wayside in favor of intense bitterness and a bit of caramel sweetness. "
Many thanks to Derek for the chance to try this beer.
Poured a golden-orange haze from the can and it looked fantastic. The nose was wonderful with just a bounty of citrus flowing from it. Oranges really stand out to me. The body was just like orange juice beer. It tastes so juicy and refreshing and sweet with a light bitterness at the end. Really really crushable and a fantastic beer from Tree House!
"Poured from a can, this beer was a bright golden-orange color with a good bit of haze and a frothy eggshell white head on top. This head stuck around awhile and mellowed slow leaving great lacing. The moment the can popped open the aroma of pineapple, citric, dank, pine resiny hops all filled the air and the release over the glass was intense. Some mango, and fresh bread and light honey aromas also came to mind. The flavor was a super drinkable citrusy, dank burst of fresh hops curtaining over a smooth, sweet malt base. The pineapple and mango tropical notes were clear in the taste too. A smooth beer with light carbonation and mellow bitter finish. Lots of flavor going on here and a top tier American IPA!! I am so glad I picked some up at the brewery and have been happily sharing it. Wish Treehouse brewery was closer."
Cheers to Adam for getting this divine nectar to me. Poured from a fresh can into a snifter.
"Had a growler from Tree House. Really unlike almost any other IPA I've ever had. Pours out like orange juice and smells like it too. A total juicebomb, slightly dank, super drinkable....one of my favorite single IPA's..."
"Can. Pours a yellow orange opaque color with a full finger of fluffy white head that lingered for a while with nice lacing. Beautiful looking American pale ale. Smells of oranges, mangos and other citrus fruits I cannot identify. Want to say pink grapefruit. Little hop smell too. Taste is super citrus forward with a rush of mango and oranges. Little hop bitterness on the back in but overpowered by the citrus. Really juicy. Definitely more hoppy as it warms up and you drink it. Really good but I'm not giving it a 100. Thicker than most imperial pale ales. Almost like a thin stout. Really drinkable. You could down a case on a hot summer day. Ready glad I got to try this. Excellent juice bomb."
Look: A deep murky orange
Looks like thick pieapple juice. Color is cloudy orangish yellow.
Out of the grolwer taste way better than the cans.
"Golden orange with a thick milkshake head. The nose is fresh squeezed orange juice. Goes down so smooth. Citrus, fresh naval oranges, and subtle pine resin notes. Delicious!"
"A: looks like juice...orange and murky, lovely. S: fruity, oranges, some tropical fruit. T: did I say juice? Tropical fruits, nice citrus presence...delicious. M: creamy, on the heavy side for an IPA. O: this is my new favorite IPA...just a delight..."
The beer pours an apricot syrup. 
"Received in a trade, only 8 days old."
"Really enjoyable and drinkable, but honestly I was a touch underwhelmed following the hype this has. I definitely preferred Sap, but I wouldn't turn Julius down!"
"L: You know it's Julius. Cloudy, tangerine color."
"I've had this a couple times before, but got a handful of really fresh cans from BA wuntrikpony, and after cracking a couple this weekend, I was inspired to write down my thoughts. Enjoyed out of the ""new"" can design with a canning date of 9/2. Poured into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass."
"This beer is the blueprint for the NE style IPA. I've had it a week old and at a month old and it's great either way. Dense body, think mouthfeel. It's slightly bitter yet balanced and creamy. Get your hands on this whenever you can."
"Wow. Just wow. My second ever 5 on BA. Canned on 9/2. Pours an absolutely beautiful murky, hazy, cloudy, orange and peach. The nose is stunning. I could use this stuff as cologne every day. Orange, peach, mango, tangerine, passion fruit, so tropical and citrusy, just bursting out of my tulip. The taste doesn't disappoint. Perfectly sweet orange and peach upfront, transforms into a luscious mango before finishing with juicy tangerine. If the taste wasn't amazing enough, the mouth feel is possibly my favorite of any beer to date. It has a creamy and mouth covering feel that goes down so smooth and leaves a nice bitter tangerine aftertaste in your mouth. Will definitely seek out any tree house I can get my hands on after this experience."
Look: Deep orange. Very little head; 1/8 inch but fairly creamy. No transparency.
When you first pour the beer you see the bright orange color and immediate smell the citrus. Definitely what you would expect looking at the can. The hazy beer drinks super smooth with just the right amount of bitterness as it finishes. Love it every time I get the chance to have one. Cheers
"I almost wanted to be letdown by this beer. But I do have to say by no means was I disappointed. Pours murky looking like fresh squeezed orange juice. Smell of citrus (orange, pineapple), taste follows suit with some dank. Great hop profile with tropical fruit juiciness. I'd recommend to any hop head and then some."
I felt like this was a great beer. But I think I may have got an old can from the guy I traded with because I don't feel close to how everyone else seems to feel on this. It just wasn't bursting with all these mango and papaya that I have been reading about. I still think it is a great beer but I believe it to be over-hyped. But I will definitely be seeking this out again to make sure I just didn't get an off can.
Tons of fruity goodness as expected. Sits a little heavy. Flavor came through well as it warmed.
"Wonderful hazy orange color. Good mango, citrus aroma. Poor malt body and a harsh lingering bitterness. Good IPA, probably even wonderful, but not earthshatteringly awesome."
Smells like citrus. Looks like fresh squeezed orange juice. So smooth and the hops shine like bright stars. Incredible beer that I wish I could get more of.
"Can dated 8/18/15. This is my first Julius and I'm already disappointed that I don't have another one to drink after this (yet....). Pours opaque and murky almost like fresh squeezed orange juice. Immediately hit with an intoxicating aroma of oranges and ripe mango or peaches. There is also a pleasant dankness too it. Taste is just a continuation of juicy tropical fruit with a bit of citrus pith and pine aftertaste that lingers. So smooth and drinkable. I've never given a beer a 5 before but I think this deserves it. Too bad I don't have regular access this to this, cause my beer buying choices would be so much more simplified. I wouldn't need to buy anything else I don't think."
"Finally got the chance to try this and it certainly impressed. Looked like orange juice along with having an awesome aroma and nice, juicy taste. Would certainly not turn it down should I have the chance to get more. Remarkable IPA."
16oz Can!
"exceptional ipa Hazy deep orange color with a nice white head and amazing lacing. Notes of oranges, citrus pith, light pine and mild mango. Silky feel finishes clean with a medium body. This is an absolute stunning IPA in every way"
So smooth. So citrusy. That color.
"Here it is, the last of a 4-pack. I already know it's the best IPA I've ever had, and the only IPA to which I've given all 5s, but now I'll do a formal review. 16 oz. can into a tulip glass."
"If I could rate this beer a solid 10 + I would...it is absolutely OFF. THE. CHARTS. AMAZING!!!!!! Color is like a milky sunset orange; it captivates and lures you in at sight. Smell is outstanding...peachy, apricot, citrus goodness. Please please PLEASE bottle this stuff as a perfume!!!! I'd douse myself in it and my boyfriend would be in sheer HEAVEN!!! Taste~okay here is where we get a little crazy because up until this point it's been a pure turn-on and tease. Let me preface this by recalling a movie entitled When Harry Met Sally. Remember Meg Ryan's rendition of a fake orgasm? At first sip, expect this beer to cause the real thing...it's mind-blowing amazing. Beautiful lacing from a pure white head, it's truly pillowy and extremely easy to drink. For me, the peachy/apricot notes are prominent upon smell, opening up to strong notes of mango, papaya and a touch of melon to taste. This beer lingers on the palate, so don't rush in for a second sip too soon! Sit back and relive that first sip for a couple minutes...the finish is amazingly smooth and fresh!! On a side note...this beer can be dangerously easy to drink and cause people to slip and say things they may be held accountable for: Honey, am I really getting a diamond engagement ring within the next 6 months???!! hehe!! ; )"
"Pours a murky orange bronze with medium white head. Lots of carbonation in this one. Smell is incredibly sweet almost like honey. Bursting with hops, lots of tropical fruits and ightly floral. I really liked this be and if it was local to me I could see it being my go-to IPA."
Got in a trade
"Best IPA I have ever had, could write an in depth review of how citrusy the aromas are and the amazing mango and bitter hops but if your interested in this beer I highly recommend it"
"Hazy deep orange color with a nice white head and amazing lacing. Notes of oranges, citrus pith, light pine and mild mango. Silky feel finishes clean with a medium body. This is an absolute stunning IPA in every way."
Received in a trade with @DrunkyBuddha thanks dude!
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with crisp white head. Unbelievably complex nose full of fresh citrus. Orange and mango are predominant, and as others have mentioned these hit in multiple waves. The taste follows the nose with sweet citrus. Very smooth, velvety mouthfeel with a medium body. Overall one of the best IPA's I've had. Refreshing, sweet citrus, smooth and clean."
"Amazing. Looks like orange juice and smells like tropical fruit juice. I want this with my wheaties every morning. Taste almost follows the nose perfectly, very tropical. Feel is very nice and medium bodied, carbonation is perfect too."
"This was my first Tree House beer, and holy cow was it awesome. I was lucky enough to have a buddy that had a few different ones for me to try. This first one didn't disappoint at all. It was like Orange Juice. Super easy drinking, and easily one of the top beers I've had."
"Such a delicious beer, hazy, citriusy, so excised they started canning this, had it in a growler and looking forward to getting some cans soon. Awesome to see Treehouse growing so quickly, hopefulyl they start doing distro soon."
"Hazy orange color, looks like orange juice. Smells like juicy, tropical fruit with a dank hint. Taste follows with some sweet juicy fruits like orange and papaya. Body feels very smooth but not heavy. Very balanced IPA, doesn't seem bitter at all for me, just a lot of hops in the taste and aroma but with a moderate amount of bitterness, just to balance the beer."
"Great beer, didn't quite live up to the hype for me. It's a fantastic, well balanced IPA. But for something rated this highly I expected a lot more hop flavor and aroma. Look and mouthfeel are perfect. Taste and smell just didn't have that ""WOW"" factor a lot of other northeast IPAs have."
"My god. Julius is the man! the aroma of this isn't over powering, but it not going to kick you in the vag/nuts like some super hop aroma beers, but it's still something I would love in candle scent for my flat. This isn't a tea bag you in the mouth IPA, this isn't super malty like some regular IPAs can be, but it's just a very well balanced IPA. I'm not a big IPA fan but this hit the spot for me. Being in Tampa, I'm used to the maltier IPAs, so this was a refreshing change. I love the look of this. Nice and hazy. It felt great as Julius danced on my tongue and slid down my throat with little burn."
"The best way for me to describe this beer is, not what I expected."
"Revisiting this one. Left my old review below, as I have noticed marked batch variation on this beer."
"I finally got my hands on Julius back in July. Smells just like pineapple and orange juice. Pours a typical East Coast IPA hazy yellow which I really like. Tastes so good and refreshing, so citrusy and smooth. I could enjoy this beer on the hottest summer day or cold winter evening. Highly recommended."
"Can from the brewery, a few days old."
16 oz. can. Dated 8/18/15.
Super juicy. Beautiful in the glass - cloudy. Great hops. Nice can. This was a delight.
"Look: Orange juice like yellow haze, nice frothy white head and a very sexy noticeable lacing on the glass. Nice looking beer."
Love this beer because it is always such an easy drinker. 
"The smoothest IPA ever, delicious mouth taste and wonderful aftertaste."
"How could a beer ever live up to this hype? Incredibly Julius does. If there's a perfect India Pale Ale, Tree House has apparently solid their souls to the devil for the recipe. Stunning color, aroma, massive citrus flavor, but the key here is that while many great IPAs push the citrus envelope, there's another layer of complexity in this beer. Perhaps its the water profile, the hop bill and schedule, house yeast, but this beer is truly exceptional and nearly in a category all its own."
Such a juicy soft IPA
"What a phenomenal experience! Pours a gorgeous dark orange haze. The smell of orange zest, citrus and mango is overwhelming. An extremely well-balanced, smooth, creamy finish with a hint of pine. This beer absolutely lives up to it's hype. If you're lucky enough to live within driving distance of the brewery, do yourself a favor and visit. You won't regret it."
Great beer. Wish tree house was more accessible.
Maybe I got an old can but this brew is good but not as outstanding as everyone says it is. It's very drinkable but so are many other beers I've had that are much easier to get. I definitely want to try this again so it can get another shot at my Top 10. Just had an opportunity to try this again! Now I know what the hype is all about. Absolutely outstanding! I would recommend this awesome beer to anyone. Visit Tree House if you're ever in the neighborhood.
It's like no other IPA you have ever had.. Watch out Heady... You are going to start falling from your perch... Julius is on its way up!!
"Great, great beer. Tropical notes come through on the nose and plays well with the hops on the tongue."
"Look - Vibrant Orange, opaque and pours with a nice head"
Poured from two 16oz cans into a snifter (when sharing) and a tulip (self serve). Pours very hazy/cloudy with a white head that fades away but not quickly. The color is head on with orange juice or the light orange feature of the can. So much tropical fruit with orange citrus upfront and finishes very smooth and piney. ALot of hop character. Overall 5/5 and this is defintely my favorite IPA right now.
"Overall, this is everything that is great about NE hops. A solid, balanced beer with great mouth feel, lots of hops that are balanced with the rest of the beer, and some orange notes to make it even better. Some beers aren't worth the hype - this one is!"
"Poured from a 16oz can into a teku glass. Pours a little cloudy with a fluffy white head. Smells of citrus, passion fruit, melon and peach. Tastes very citrusy and fruity with a little hop punch at the end. WOW it begs for another sip. This one is a GEM!!"
Another turbid glowing orange beer from treehouse. They really nailed the orange and other citrus smell and taste of this beer. I just wished these were easier to obtain.
If I could only drink one beer JULIUS would definitely be it! Amazing!
"Pours hazy orange with a nice two finger white head. Aromas of orange zest, mango, and juicy citrus. Flavors mirror the nose quite well - sweet malt and hint of grassy hop bitterness offer a very nice balance throughout. Medium mouthfeel. Very delicious beer!"
Tried from a fresh can poured into a teku glass.
I had this fresh from the can. Absolutely bursting with flavor. It was extremely juicy on the nose and palate with a pleasing thick mouth feel. The finish was more juice balanced with hops.
"This beer absolutely lives up to the hype. The nose is the best I've ever experienced on an IPA (better than Heady) - huge citrus notes of orange, mango, et al (I don't really get the pineapple that a lot of people seem to mention). The taste follows the nose with a ton of citrus, but the most impressive thing is how balanced and subtle the bitterness is. There is an amazing hop oil finish to the taste that just makes you want to take another sip right away. It's extremely juicy, but still nails that balanced hop flavor that you expect from a great IPA. I could drink this all day...."
This quite possibly is the best beer I have ever had.......if heaven had a flavor it most certainly would be Julius
From the time you crack this beer down to the bittersweet last sip this beer is amazing. The super citrusy tropical aroma the nice fluffy head on the pour and the unbelievable ideal IPA taste are all what make this my favorite beer going right now. I'm blessed to live 30 minutes away from the brewery
"Cracked this one open tonight, got it on a trade on Sunday. Pours a deep opaque orange with a fluffy white head that sticks around. Smell is super fruit, just pure orange and mango. OK, this is amazing, one of the best beers I've ever had. The mango on the tongue is so potent you could have told me this was juice. Notes of blood orange and pineapple, sweet malt, hint of grassy hop bitterness. The feel is so light and smooth. Drinks like a mango orange smoothie. Overall this beer deserves all the credit it gets."
"Pours a beautiful hazy orange. Really bright. Smell is loaded with tropical and citrus fruit. Taste carries over from the smell. Tons of sweet citrusy hop flavor. Mango, orange, pineapple. Full bodied substantive mouth feel."
J U I C Y !
"Opened this growler and walked across the room to grab a glass. Stopped in my tracks, because I could suddenly smell it. From all the way across the room (a fairly large room). Tropical, citrusy juice. I have no idea how they achieved a nose like that, but I want it in my life every day. (Julius Candles, anyone?). "
Unbelievably great taste lives up to the hype. Might be my fav.
"From the gorgeous orange pour, the passion fruit explosion nose and delicious hop taste, this brew is amazing. Can't express how much I love this beer. Great job tree house."
Fantastic.
Nose wafts citrus and pineapple. Taste is similar with more mango and melon. Body has a resinous chewy feel with fair carbonation.
"Beautiful, hazy bright orange appearance that is almost artificial color. A tropical citrus nose is predominant, with a hint of bitterness in the aroma. Bitterness and citrus bursts out of the glass but blend well together to create a well balanced product. Mouth feel is not exactly as astoundingly soft and cloudy as some of Treehouse's other offerings, but this is definitely an improvement over many other IPA's I've had. Overall I would drink this again but probably not soon due to the limited availability and lack of distribution, however hopefully they will begin making this beer more en mass."
"This one pours a hazy orange. A thick white head dissipates into nice lacing all the way down. Aroma is tropical fruit, think mango and pineapple. The taste is more fruit and orange peal. Great all around beer."
"Pour is dark orange, extremely cloudy, with lots of white head, some large bubbles, decent retention, and a thick lace. Nose is heavy mango and citrus, with a bit of mango rind, lightly earthy, with notes of grapefruit. Flavor profile follows the nose to a T. Tons of tropical fruit, mango and grapefruit, with a citrus blast, low bitterness, a mostly creamy feel, a touch granule towards the back end with aggressive carbonation. Bitterness creeps up a little through the finish and lingers a touch."
"Thanks to mdr4669 for these cans washing up on the shores of maximum12. Had a few samplers of Treehouse at tastings, but this is my first full pour. 16 oz. yellow/orange can that you won’t lose in the woods. "
"I'm going to say it - I think this beer came to me a little overhyped. I was expecting a more subdued bitterness with a big citrus bomb - this is not what I got, sadly."
L: Murky orange brew that looks more like a smoothie than a beer. Fluffy off-white head that looks like a washed out version of the body. Thick sticky lacing sticks around.
"What can be said about one of the greatest flagship beers available? If you have had the pleasure of tasting this beer then you will know that words cannot do it justice. The greatest advantage to living in Ellington, CT is that I am a mere 15 minutes away from the best brewery in the United States."
"Great brew. Very juicy, hop forward and great mouth feel with a nice lingering finish. Provides just enough malt to showcase the hops in all of its glory."
Bitter and dry orange peels in liquid form.
"i like this beer a lot!! its loaded with fruits in the taste, more so than smell... great ipa, very easy going and super drinkable, not as extreme as sope double ipas though!!"
"Poured from a 16oz can from the old can style immediately after getting it in a trade despite it being 10:30AM. It' pours a cloudy orangeish tint. The smell and auroma wasn't as strong as I thought it would be but when drinking, it tasted like straight orange juice. Phenomenal beer!"
Fantastic fruity ipa worth trying.
No date on can but I know that it was canned on 7/31/15; drank in a pint tumbler on 8/1/15. Just amazing!
"No canning date visible but acquired from the brewery yesterday, where the canning machinery was visible and was still loaded with more Julius cans to fill. "
"The can I had was apparently from a June batch and I was still seriously impressed with this beer. Citrus notes still strong, hazy pour with plenty of carbonation leaving silky lacing. My wife even loved it which for her is a rare thing since she hardly touches beer at all. I would love to try some of this fresh!"
"Julius is perfection in a glass. I don't know how the guys at TreeHouse do it, but this beer is one of the few that lives up to the hype and surpasses it."
"Poured from a tallboy can. Comes in a gorgeous hazy orange color. Looks like orange juice with spot on carb and a beautiful fluffy finger and a half of off white head. The nose is hoppy oranges, pineapple, mango, and some pine..the taste follows suit. Wow..what a brilliant beer. Tastes like hoppy orange pineapple juice. I'm blown away. The hype is real. Such a creamy mouthfeel. Might be better than focal banger."
Definitely not the best single IPA I have ever had. But very good. Would recommend trading for or trying!
"Pours a dark amber, completely hazed color, with a decent, bubbly head."
12oz Can poured into my tulip glass
"One of the best IPAs I've ever had. I think the only other IPA that I like better is Green IPA, also from Tree House. Everything TH is just SO top notch, I'm not sure how they are not considered the best brewery in USA! "
"This might be my favorite ipa. Better from a fresh growler than a fresh can. There's a bit more pine out of the can, not really a negative, but I do prefer my ipas (or at least IPAs of this style) to be a bit more fruity."
"This is certainly the most balanced IPA I have had. I do not get the orange juice flavor everyone else seems to get. Citrusy, yes, but not like I am drinking tropicana. It is insanely crushable, the hops do not over power. I like hoppy beers, but this is so smooth. "
This is an elite beer in every way.
16 oz can (thanks Leo!) poured into a Jow's Arcade tulip glass
Lots of citrus and hops aroma. Taste is very refreshing. Did a side by side with Heady and SOS. This was the clear winner.
16 oz. can into snifter. 
"Juicy and absolutely delicious! Excellent citrus/orange flavor, perfect body for a summer refresher!"
"Delicious. Nice citrus smell and flavor. smooth, light, crisp easy beer to drink. was fresh this week. would definatly make the trip to Tree house to get again."
So Dinner is actually at the top of my list for best IPA but this is a close second for me. The mango and orange come together so well and the creamy finish makes this very smooth with just the right amount of bitterness. Most of the pineyness lies in the nose with citrus dominating the flavor profile. Quite different than the west-coast IPA with is very earthy/piney. 90% of beers do not live up to the hype but this certainly does.
"Pours a dark orange with a thin white head, not the lighter orange, more juicy color I was expecting"
"Don't get me wrong - this is a fantastic IPA bursting with tropical fruit and citrus. However, with the hype behind it, I expected something a bit more. It was outshined by the double dry hopped fort point I had the same night. Drinks a bit thin, but it's very smooth and absurdly crushable."
Fresh 16oz can poured into a snifter tasting glass.
"This beer is absolutely unbelievable! I don't know how they are doing it, but it's like drinking the best fruit juice I've ever had. The can is opened and you are hit with a peach smell that will blow your mind. The taste follows it right up. The true test is my wife loves it and she hates ipas. This is a must have"
Appearance: Pours a hazy copper consistent with an east coast IPA with light head that quickly dissipates and moderate lacing.
"A: Darker amber color with a perfect cloudy look, pours a small white head, but amazing lacing."
"The hype is very real for this one. Was able to trade for 2 cans and while I loved the first can I drank, it wasn't until the second one that I really understood what was so great about this beer. As the brewery says, this is insanely drinkable. It goes down so smooth. Perfect balance between hops and malt with the hops shining in an amazing way. I will be driving to treehouse very soon to grab some of this beer. Top notch all the way."
"Wonderful beer, the best I have ever had. Explodes citrus, just enough bitterness, creamy, delicious."
"Been seeing the Sculpin IPA on the shelf all around Boston, scared off by the price at $15/6 pack, read some reviews, thought I give it a chance. And, JULIUS is SOOOOO much bettah. Just wish I lived closer to Tree House or it lived closer to me. I love going there and the team there is really great."
"L - Pours into chalice foggy-gold, with ample 1 inch head."
A fresh pint can poured into a tulip glass. Can is undated but this can is from last weeks release.
"One of my current favorite ""readily available"" options. Juicy and drinkable... this beer looks, smells, and tastes very much like you would expect: orange/tropical fruit juice beer, at least as much as you could get orange juice and tropical fruit out of an IPA/APA. I couldn't convince my non-BA brother that this wasn't brewed with juice/fruit/zest..."
"It's just so good. Totally tropical and juicy. If you can get your hands on any in California, definitely spend the $$. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. Easily top 5."
"Everyone says it and its true, just an incredibly big juice bomb. So very juicy. Beautiful citrus smell and color. This could be a bushel of fermented oranges that were then squeezed into a can, and I think most people would believe it. Screams everything orange."
Just fantastic. Cloudy and orange. Loads of citrus fruit flavor. Just a touch of sweetness on back end. Easy to drink with just a touch of bitter.
its just straight juice! so so tasty
"Pours a chalky-bright, rich orange, cloudy haze with a one finger head. Smells like fruit, tropical juice, mango, pineapple and orange. Taste is incredibly crisp and refreshing. Lots of bursting citrus followed by a lean bitterness, fading into bready malt. Wonderfully balanced. Leaves your mouth with a mild peppery zest and clean aftertaste. Insanely drinkable. Airs just slightly on the thinner/lighter side, but hardly worth mentioning. If this glass was bottomless it's hard to say when you'd ever put it down. This beer lives up to every bit of the hype."
lucious; amazing; juicy and delicious
Poured from a 1 pint can into a Rhode Island Brewfest IPA glass.
"Pours bright copper with orange hues. Slightly frothy egg-shell head with low retention. Cloudy but not particles. Spotty laces. The nose is orange zest to start, then hoppy bitterness and nectarine. The taste starts with a hop bite that goes to very nice notes of orange zest, nectarine, malt, and ends with a crisp hop bite. This is not over juicy but more bitter, like orange rinds. This is smooth, moderate carb, and moderate body."
citrus galore. tastes like orange without being too sweet. What is really unique is the creamy feel. never had an ipa like this
This is an amazing beer from Tree House. Best American IPA out there!
"Pours a cloudy murky orange peach color, with a thin off-white head. There is a bit of carbonation and some lacing. The odor is powerful, IPA, peach, orange, grapefruit, apricot, tropical fruits, passion fruit, clove, a little bit of pine. The taste is crisp, citrus, fruity, orange, grapefruit, apricots, juicy, floral, slightly grassy, slight spice, slight bitterness throughout."
"Fantastic brew, very smooth, super citrusy, but balanced"
"A magnificent, citrus, somewhat thicker, legendary IPA. What a beer! Find this, buy this, seek this out as it is a masterpiece in the World of craft beer."
Canned 6/12/15 I believe:
"This beer really is absolutely fantastic. It is the pinnacle of what has been christened the New England IPA style. It is unbelievably fruity and easily drinkable. This is one of those beers where every sip you go ""oh my god, oh my god."" It has a beautiful translucent orange color, somewhat like orange juice, it smells and tastes like near-perfection. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."
Citrusy and zesty. Pours like OJ.
A great IPA. This beer has a unbelievable taste from start to finish. It pours a wonderful orange haze into the glass with a citrus flavor that is as smooth and sweet with just a incredible bitter aftertaste. Just about the best beer I have ever had. ENJOY!
"I have had this 3 times now, can, growler, and then growler again."
"Heaven in a glass or in a can! Julius delivers on the hype. Truely wonderful beer. Not overly bitter, definitely a ton of citrus and tropical fruits in there."
"Enjoying a fresh one from todays release on Treehouses' 3rd anniversary! My new fav. So much mango, papaya. A hint of cracker malt and then bam!!! You get a solid kick of bitterness. Well done."
"From 06/11/15 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing this one, finally got to try it. 16 oz. can into a tulip."
I describe it as the best orange Witbier combined with the best IPA. And you get JULIUS. amazing aroma of orange and other tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose with the slightest malt and bitterness to balance off one of the best IPAs ever produced!
Nice fresh growler. I liked their green a little more.
"After the pilgrimage to Tree House and several growlers and cans of Julius, I feel ready to write a review of the best IPA I've had."
"A: Dark orange, golden honey. Nectary. "
"Essentially one of the most drinkable IPA's i've ever had. It's smooth, fruity like biting into an orange peel."
L- dark brown/orange - assumptions are a B - still very pretty but this wasn't as beautiful as advertised 
"L: pretty, dark orange with. Bone white head that leaves a good deal of lacing and a sizable collar"
Got a can of this on a trade as an extra. Very simple cool can. Basically a silver tin can with a simple orange logo. Poured into a glass. Very cloudy pale straw body. Smells so good. Lots of citrus in the aroma. Just amazing aroma. Big fruity taste. Tons of citrus and orange come though. Fairly bitter as well. Absolutely excellent beer.
Again I got this one from Hopsouras when he was on a business trip up in the NE. He said it had just rolled off the canning line when he was there and sent it express to me! Unbelievable! And it is Beeradvocates #1 American IPA. (I agree!)
Perfection! One of the best brews I've ever had
"Full of citrus flavor, like taking a bite into an orange. Full body, and great hop aroma."
This stuff is liquid gold!! Can't believe how dangerously drinkable it is!
Transcendent. Transcends even that. Next-level shit to the power of 80.
It's everything that's good about beer.
This is as perfect a beer as they come
Get some ASAP! Juicy hazey orange in appearance. Frothy head that slowly fades only if u drink slowly. Smells of fruit juice perfume and dank hops.. Great rep of the hop cone. Great job fellas!
"At brewery. Not sure what happened, but not what I was expecting."
On tap at the brewery and fresh in a can.
"Big citrus bitterness, aroma is very nice as well"
To be completely upfront on my review: 
Acquired via trade from @NickWebster87. Poured into snifter
"One of the best beers available today! This IPA tops the charts and frankly I can't see how it will be beat! Juice bomb! Holy oranges! Syracuse has a new mascot! The citrus component gives way for a crisp, hoppy finish. Almost no bitterness and/or dryness. Well done! I had a taste test Julius vs Heady on 8/18/15 and Julius won!! Better aroma, citrus notes galore and the pillowy mouthfeel is superb!!"
Just had this for the 4th time...next to a ZD and Congress St. 
"So pillowy and juicy, just keeps you wanting more. My favorite beer from my favorite brewery!"
Enjoyed from 16 oz can (canned 5/6). This was everything I was hoping for. Beautiful cloudy appearance. Citrusy/piney smell. Perfectly balanced sweet and bitter taste.
"One word to sum up this beer... outstanding!! As of late, even with the amazing beers I've been trying, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. The beer's flavors and aromas are awesome and it is ridiculously drinkable (straight out of the can, or served in proper glassware). Treehouse definitely killed it with this one! Cheers!"
"Finally! The big, bad Julius. Got it in a 2L growler and cans at the brewery in early May 2015. Beautiful, and I mean beautiful, cloudy/hazy golden-orange color with a decent bright white head. Poured much better out of the growler than the can, oddly enough. Whole lotta citrus and other tropical fruit. Very soft and fragrant in both the nose and the taste. I get some malt, too, which was unexpected. Just not as much going on as I had hoped. Incredible drinkability and feel. Like cream. Good finish, slightly bitter and piney. To be honest, it didn't blow me out of the water like I expected it would. I think the growler was better. Still fantastic, though."
Huge thanks to hoppymcgee for the hook up on this can! Thanks!!! 
Benchmark for all other American IPAs
Smoothest IPA I've ever had. Incredible beer. Doesn't get much better than this.
2L growler poured into a Tree House tulip.
"This one pours out as a hazy yellowish orange color with a think white head on top. The smell of this is juicy, it's got lots of ripe citrus and floral hops coming on strong. The flavors are citrusy as well with some subtle bitterness, I'm picking up a little bit of chalkiness in the finish too which kind of hinders my score a bit. Overall it's still a great IPA!"
Second canned batch (?). Canned about a week and a half ago. Tulip glass.
can enjoyed from a treehouse taster. pours thick murky nectarine lace is sheets of foam on the glass. nose is straight up oj. tangerine/nectarine. what a flavorable ipa. super easy drinking. super delish. worth hunting down.
"Pours a hazy, copper-orange color with a 2 finger off-white head that dissipates very quickly. Leaves some decent, splotchy lacing. "
At under 7%... with the company is currently resides... this will certainly climb much higher in the ranking than where it sits today. The way an IPA should be...
best ipa i've had. it is more that i expected.
Love it in its can form
"Had a one week old can poured into snifter. I thought this was a good IPA, but definitely overhyped. I don't think it holds a flame to some other IPA options out there, especially in the NE region. While it's got a great smell and taste, it had a tad too much malt presence and was not as citrus or juicy as anticipated. Still a great beer, but not a 100 score for me. I had this next to MBC Dinner and it blew Julius away."
"Ahhh Julius. This is my favorite IPA from treehouse, by far. Dark orange, hazy, murky deliciousness. Immediately hit with nectarine, grapefruit, peach and mango. Feels creamy and has perfect carbonation. I could drink this any day, any time, and in any weather. Perfect beer in my opinion!"
"This was perfection. So juicy, plump, and balanced."
Liquid Trader Joes mango gummies. Perfection.
This beer is a tropical fruit bomb. One of the best IPA's I have ever had. Taste is juicy mango/orange with a slight bitter finish. A must try!!!!
64 oz growler was poured into a pint glass. 
"Appearance- Orange amber in color, turbid, and pours a two inch head."
Lives up to the hype. So smooth.
"I've had this a lot. Finally out of the can. Oh my lord this is still stupid good beer! Whatever it takes for you to acquire, just do it. It'll more than likely take the taste out your mouth. Cheers!"
"AMAZING! This was one of the best beers I have ever had. Easily in the top 5. Insanely drinkable and the flavors and aromas jump right out of the can. My only minor issue with Julius is I wish it had a little more bite at the end. It goes down so incredibly smooth, almost too smoth. . . . Overall tho like I said easily in my top 5 along with heady, focal, pliny, SOS. . . Up there with all the big boys!"
Poured from a 16oz can into a Tree House tulip glass.
I picked up a 6 pack of this at the brewery on 4/25/15.
Poured from a 16oz can into a Tree House tulip glass. Thanks AL for picking this up at the brewery today for me!
Tried from a fresh Can. Nice deep orange and tons of citrus on the nose with a huge citrus finish! Great Stuff!!!
"this is maybe the best their is. pours a dark hazy orange, aroma is just orange and orange zest. mouthfeel is unreal. the taste is epic citrus bursting through and beautiful on the palate. Everytime I have one I am more impressed."
"Awesome fruit forward IPA, citrus, peach, smooth and hoppy... creamy finish... just awesome! Put this on tap in my basement and i'm a 300lb alcoholic in no time!"
Special thanks to Maverick74 for the high quality trade.
"Thick, rich dark chocolately and complex. Absolutely delicious dessert of a beer."
Growler shared by biggsbowler. Clear light yellow pour with a white head. Grapefruit hop aromas. Big grapefruit hop notes dominate. Sturdy malt backbone. Very good mouthfeel with a good body.
"L - Gorgeous. Deep dark orange ball of haze. Cloudy, but at the same time not murky. Extremely appetizing. "
"Wow, This beer certainly met the hype. Extremely drinkable. Glad to have a growler of this and will continue to search this one out. This is the only beer I have had that can rival the amount of citrus that comes through in HF IPAs. Amazing"
"Haven't typed out a review in a while, but as this beer is my first 5 Overall, a few words:"
This beer will make you smile. 
"Brilliance in a bottle is an understatement for this highly reviewed IPA. Began the evening with a 750ml bottle from the previous weekend's batch. The color pours into my Hill Farmstead tulip glass a perfect pale golden tone. The smell of orange, grapefruit, and citrus fills the air immediately when opened. Freshly squeezed orange grapefruit juice with the mild bitterness of hop to give it that classic taste. A beautifully crafted IPA and easily one I will go out of my way to try again. Cannot recommend the aesthetic quality of this enough."
LOOK: Color: a marvelous gold yellow orange. Almost opaque but not cloudy.
Not a bad thing to say about this beer. Delicious citrus smell and flavor and amazing mouth feel. One of the most refreshing and drinkable beers that I have ever had
Holy hell what an ipa.
Poured from a 750ml growler and the first beer of an incredible bottle share. Amazing tropical notes and truly tastes like OJ mixed with an IPA. Incredible!
My first beer from this brewery and I had not heard any hype beforehand. This is simply the nectar of the gods...
One of the best beers on the planet. I have been lucky enough to travel the US for many years for me job and have tried most of the other brews on this top list and i always go back to thinking of how amazing this beer is.This is the BEST IPA ive ever had. I am so excited for them to begin canning in the next coming months and get my hands on some more.
My first Tree House beer. Just outstanding!
"Invited to drink a glass with a friend who just picked up some beer at the brewery. Incredible. Fresh, citrus, amazing after taste. One of the best I've had."
"Great beer, awesome to have this one so close to home, drank a 750 within 24 hours of pour. To me this sits right next to Lunch by Maine Beer for best IPA. The only thing about it that turned me off at all was it sat heavy in the nose, awesome mango/citrus in your face but nail polish remover also came to mind. (and this is not a complaint for sure, it wasn't overwhelming) As for taste it's cleannn from beginning to end; Hop hits hard and then the fruitiness at the end makes you want more and more. Dank and delicious! Top 5 IPA IIPA"
About as good as it gets. Huge mango nose and tons of citrus. All this and so smooth and fresh.
"In a world of IPAs that taste awfully similar, here is Julius. It may not be the absolute perfect tasting IPA I've ever had, but it really is a bit of a curveball from the average IPA flavor profile. Like it's name might possibly suggest, this baby is all oranges: orange rind, orange pulp, orange juice, Tang, orange gummy bears. The potency of the oranges becomes even more apparent as the beer warms to room temperature. I'd even suggest drinking Julius at a chill level closer to room temperature because the flavors really expand. From Tree House, I personally prefer Green, but Julius is a lovely little beast."
Super juicy. Excellent ipa with great citrus taste
I don't write many reviews but this beer deserves one 
"Look : Cloudy, on the Darker side of Golden."
Lots of peach and mango flavored and aromas. Really balanced and absolutely delicious. Not a super hop Bomb but a really nuanced and balanced ipa.
Waited 2 hours in line for this beer today. Add two hours to drive home. Kiss the wife and roll back the top on a very fresh growler. Poured into a tree house snifter.
750 into a HotD tulip. Filled 11/28/14.
"Holy juicy tropical juicy nectar, like EXTREMELY JUICY. Could use a little more balance behind all the hop juice in your face. Cant wait to see how the canned product turns out."
"Golden hazy orange with a thick white lingering head, nice lacing on the glass. Bursting with tropical, orange hop smell with a hint of dankness. Bitter orange flavor with tropical hop flavors shining through as well. Great mouthfeel, carbonation is a bit lower out of the can than out of the growler I had previously. One of the best out there right now."
First time I had this was straight orange juice. This is more of a hazy bronze. Still good lacing and still 2+ finger frothy head. Such a strong smell. Dank orange juice and other citrus. Hint of pine. Absolutely fresh taste. Both sweet and bitter orange. Really get a background juicy sweet mango. Other citrus and tropicals I can't place. Super juicy but carbonation is a tad low. Leaves a sticky sweetness like I ate a Starburst or something. Phenomenal beer.
Everything that the can says. Love this beer
"Julius looks beautiful in the glass. Smells like tropical fruit. When I first tried Julius I thought it was almost too fruity, now after 20+ times of enjoying it, i love the fruity taste. Finishes just bitter enough to make you come back for more. Although it's not my favorite tree house beer, it deserves its reputation as world class."
An absolutely amazing IPA. This is full of cirtus and so juicy. So glad I finally got a chance to try this beer. Probably the best IPA I have ever had!
A: Pours a super hazy dark golden color with a one finger off white head. Chunks of lace on the glass after each sip.
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
"The best IPA being brewed today. Yes, better the RRBC and HT. Full of flavor, aromatic, complex to the taste. Every time I taste something else within this perfect libation. Mission Accomplished."
"Open passionpineapplegrapefruit,"
"Just wow. Gorgeous orange sunset in the glass. Wafts of grapefruit, sticky resin and a hint of pine. Flavor follows the nose profile: Notes of grapefruit, tangerine, nice stickiness and the undernote of pine again. This is a single IPA that has the huge flavor and juiciness of a double. Reminds me a bit of HF's hoppy offerings. Balanced, sophisticated and great. Look forward to trying more Treehouse."
"Just an amazing representation of the single IPA. Tree House pretty much knocks it out of the park with everything they brew and it's obvious why Julius is the flagship. I've been fortunate and have had many offerings from them and they produce the finest beer in MA, hands down. That's considering the stiff competition from others like Trillium, Pretty Things, etc..."
Awesome brew.worth the 45 min.ride
Seems to vary from 4.5-5.0 depending on batch.
Have had this 4 or 5 times now and finally getting around to reviewing. Thanks to Cam for sharing this 750ml growler. 
"A- My second 750ml of this throughout the last week. Poured into two snifters with a slightly hazed apricot amber body. The head is white and foamy, frothy textured rising to about one finger. Decent retention and lacing is a mix of webs, sheets and spots."
The beer comes in a deep rich orange. Looks like fruit juice with a splash of blood orange.
"Growler courtesy of Cam....oh man, what a great surprise. Thank you buddy!"
"This beer is something else. The one word that I will forever associate with Julius is FRESH! It tastes so dang fresh. The hops smell as though you were holding them fresh picked in your hands. Seriously. The flavor is off the charts and for a sub 7% abv ipa, it is packed full of hop flavor! With all that being said, this beer isn't a hop bomb like a west coast style. Its well balanced like Heady topper with a touch of sweetness to even things out. One of my favorite IPAs of all time. wow."
"This beer blew me away, world class IPA"
"easily one of the top IPA's I have ever had, that includes Pliny the Elder and HT - South Carolina"
Awesome IPA. Definitely one of the most unique IPA's and freshest IPA I have tried.
Had a sample of it straight off the keg at the brewery and it changed my life. Freshest single IPA I have EVER had. Crisp and hop forward but well balanced. I bought 2 growlers of it to take home and it kept its freshness well!
05/24/2016
Big thanks to Deuane for cracking this growler open at Campground Brewdown.
"750ml growler filled 8/1/2014, poured into a Lawson's snifter 8/10/2014."
Pours a very hazy but luminescent apricot colour. A nice foamy head recedes rather quickly leaving a thin ring around the edges of the glass.
"Got a growler 3 days after it was kegged! Pours hazy yellow with a sustained 1/4"" head. Aroma is oranges, kiwis, and peaches with a little pine. Intense fruity taste. Peaches, apricot, papaya and cantalope with a few distinct hop layers. Tastes like an amazing fruit that doesn't exist. Sweet hop resin absolutely coats your tongue at the second half of the sip. Intense hop character without being overwhelming. Finishes dry but because of the lingering hop coating on the tongue it doesnt feel like a normal dry finish. I don't think I've ever had a beer before that I just couldn't stop drinking like this one. I barely put the glass down. Treehouse is up there with the best of the best. So psyched to have such a badass brewery here in MA."
"Thanks, jlindros. The beer is bright orangey gold in color. It's quite hazy, which I rather like for an IPA.. Not that I really dislike clear IPAs. Eh. The head is white and fairly vigorous for a growler pour. Lots of lacing. Good retention. Even after a few minutes and many sips, there's still a solid coating of bubbles on top. The aroma is massively juicy and full of hop flavor. Citrus for days. I remember reading BuckeyeNation use the term ""electric tangerine"" in a review; that would be a very apt descriptor for this beer. It smells like tangerine juice with a healthy shot of lime. There's also pineapple, kiwi, raspberry, grapefruit and pine. It's like a wonderful citrus drink spiked with a tropical fruit background. Mouthwatering stuff. Little malt presence, which is just fine with me. Taste is similarly big on juicy hop flavors. Pale malt sweetness is well in the background. Tangerine, grapefruit and lime hoppiness dominates with tropical fruits providing highlights. Moderate bitterness. Fairly dry. Tangerine rind finish. Extremely easy to drink. Light, pleasant feel. Seems like normal carbonation. Some hop oiliness. Each sip makes me want more. I feel a bit bad not sharing this growler, but I'm also glad that I didn't. This is a fantastic IPA, fully deserving its acclaim. Tree House continues to impress."
750ml flip top growler that was filled at 515pm today!
Drinking my first Julius in a while and it's pretty amazing how many breweries have (tried to) copied this beer. 
"Growler poured and shared with the girlfriend. 2L growler. Was really excited to try this, I have been craving Citra hops after King and Pseudo Sue"
"I visited the Tree house Brewery tonight and found the brewery to be inviting, relaxing, and fun!"
"Deep hazy orange pour with a big foamy white head. Tropical fruits on the nose. Mango, pineapple, and guava. Not getting any pine or rind on the nose. Very bright and juicy. Taste is right there. Not slick and bitter like a west coast IPA but not malty either. Perfect balance that has enough malt to carry the sweet tropical fruit flavors. I don't really get citrus or pine from this. It is much different than most other IPAs, which makes it so delicious. Very easy drinking and tasty."
"Seriously, This is one of the best IPA's you would ever try. The juiciness and bitterness blend so well and its so drinkable for 6.8% its scary good."
"Treehouse is making some serious moves! I know Julius has been their flagship beer for a few years, but I finally got a few bottles a couple of weeks back. Unbelievably complex yet drinkable Imperial IPA. Poured into a Treehouse tulip. ALL of their beers have great lacing on the glass, but this one especially. Its a beautiful golden orange hazy glow. Mouthfeel is big and soft with great citrusy and grapefruit notes. The description they list on this beer is spot on. I get why people wait in lines for this beer. Its THAT good. These guys are making noise in this industry, and they are only getting better!!"
1790th Review on BA
Very good beer. I don't get as much of the citrus notes as other reviewers. Malts seem to mask the hops a little. I could drink this all day. It is a wonderfully balanced beer. But don't expect a citrus bomb like Trillium.
750ml growler poured into a tulip. Enormous thanks to MattOC for this one.
Thank you Kunckle Neil
"Special thanks to Matt (blckout20) for sending me a growler of this gem via trade. Cheers, Matt!"
"was the last person in the door at Treehouse on Thursday 3/28, and got both my Treehouse Growlers filled with Julius. This was to be my first taste of this one. I've had Green last fall, which is a pretty good IPA."
"Look: Orange/brown, with white head"
Pours slightly dark orange with nice lacing. Aroma and taste is like a freshly cut orange. Imagine fresh squeezed orange juice without so much sweetness and acidity.
Thanks to jtdolla911 for this one. Enjoyed this the night before EBF Session 2.
"Poured from a growler, about 4 days old. Pours a kind of hazy copper/orange. Small head. Smells nice. Citrus, tropical fruits. A little bitterness in the smell. The taste is very juicy, slight bitterness on the end. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit rind. A little sweet. Very nice display of hops. Nice prickly mouth feel. What a great beer."
"I'm a bit torn in reviewing Julius after my second growler in two weeks: the first sample was everything I had imagined after the stellar reviews and ratings, but the second sample was like I was drinking a different beer (confirmed by the sender, a huge Julius fan)."
A: Murky and glowing – like polished copper and sunshine
Growler shared by drewone - Thanks.
Simply awesome. 
"Had on tap. So here is the thing, is this beer bursting with citrus and hop flavor? You betcha! For an american single ipa does it pack in a ton of flavor? Oh yes. Is it on of the top 20 beers in the world? Sorry, no. What saddens me is I genuinely liked this beer, but because of the hype this review will be seen as negative. Because I am not, Julius is delicious! It is hazy, smooth, drinkable, and perfect on warmer days. Very nice beer. Would personally would have liked a little more depth in hop complexity and the thickness of the mouth feel. However this beer knows what it is, a citrus NE IPA and it is true to those fundamental flavors."
"Went there this weekend... which just happened to be ""Julius Day""... This beer was outstanding worth the 2 hour wait to get my three growlers filled... The big call to this beer though the citrus I did not really notice... Will totally be buy this beer again in any case.."
"Growler pour at Woodshop 8 held at The Hermosillo in Los Angeles, CA."

750ml growler (filled earlier today) into a Gandhi-Bot tulip.
Appearance: The cloudy honey colored liquid arrives with an impressive head that leaves gobs of sticky lacing behind
"Bright, hazed orange topped with a low, thick, creamy head. Delightfully pungent hoppy aroma: pineapple, grapefruit, pine resin, earthy greenness, clementines, and a little bit of toasted malt. Huge, sticky, lip-smacking hop flavor with loads of sweet ruby red grapefruit, pine sap, tangerine, and miscellaneous tropical fruits. Medium bodied and bitter, but very smooth and obviously supremely drinkable. Gloriously hoppy and one of the finest beers I had on my vacation home to New England."
"On tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. Poured into a Tree House Willi glass."
750 ml growler served in a Kuhnhenn snifter. Thanks to time4lunch for the brew.
"Poured from a 750mL growler I picked up at the brewery yesterday, the beer is a bright, hazed, opaque, orange-copper coloring with a filmy, clingy, sparse white head that coats the glass as you drink. Aromas of grapefruit tart and sweet, pineapple, pine and resin hops characteristics, subtle bready backbone, lemon zest and orange peel. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit on the forward tongue, with a mango/pineapple sweet follow, a subtle sweetbread backbone, and then a slow build of pine pitch, resiny hops profiles, and a touch of roasted characteristics. The roast helps to cut the building bitter and robust characteristics, keeping the beer very drinkable. Robust, smooth brew with a tart, drying finish. The aftertaste is a heavy blend of tropical fruits, with a grassy, piney undertone. Very robust brew, yet extremely drinkable. Great flavors, and worth the trip to the brewery!"
Poured from a Tree House Brewing co. branded growler (per Mass. law) into a Tree House brewing co. tulip glass.
"750mL swing top growler purchased from the brewery a few hours ago. Pours a murky brownish amber with a 1/4 inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of tropical fruits. Pineapple, peach, mango and citrus hops. Smells fantastic. The taste is a lot like the aroma. Big pineapple and peach flavor. Bitter mango with hints of floral hops. I'm surprised this one is only 6.8% because it seems to have a bigger alcohol presence. However it works perfectly with the tropical fruits and is still insanely drinkable. Bitter orange peel at the finish. Heavy, oily mouthfeel. Fruity, bitter and hoppy. Great IPA. Overall, hype warranted."
Poured from a 750 mL growler into a tulip. This was filled at the brewery 3 hours ago.
My rating is based on batch variation. Sometimes the beer is a legit 4.5 and sometimes a 3.5. 
750ml 
"S: Bright tropical fruits, heavy mango and orange, grapefruit and passion fruit complementing, some dankness as well."
"Thanks to BColton1 for being a great growler mule. Served in a standard pint. Pours a dull golden orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a dense, rocky, two-inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a consistent 1/8th inch cap with textured, semi-concentric bands of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses citrus, a slight piney aroma and a hint of tropical fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also an herbal character, but not overly bitter, a light toasted malt quality and a hint of spice. Great mouthfeel on this beer - medium-light in body with a creamy texture (almost reminds me of a cask offering) and a trace of oiliness. Overall - these guys are killing it. Julius is top notch - not a bitter hop bomb, but a complex and extremely drinkable American IPA."
"Nice orange color, immediately sets off the tones of citrus and pineapple you will pick up in the nose and on the palate. "
A-Pours a turbid orange color with a great head of froth. The body has some glow and the head retains well.
"Pours a hazy orange with a nice white head. Not quite Trillium level haze, but hazier than most ipas by a fair margin."
"A - A beautiful, hazy light copper, slightly orange. Pours out of the 750ml bottle with about an inch worth of head that reduces to a thin covering and leaves a thin layer of lacing on the glass. Poured into a Tree House tulip glass. The glass is very much worth the purchase by the way."
"Really enjoyed this beer. Not too hoppy, and smooth, with very fruity undertones. A slight sour aftertaste, but not too problematic."
Growler filled this past Saturday
This is my Favorite IPA and I'm glad I reside close by.
750ml growler from Reagan1984. Served in a taster pint and shared with friends.
"750ml swing-top growler, obtained fresh from the brewery about an hour ago."
Awesome!
"750ml, filled 3/16/13"
750mL growler poured into a pint glass
"Drank from a 1 pint, 9.4 fluid ounces growler purchased at the Tree House Brewing Company, Brimfield, MA"
Pour from a 64 oz counter pressure filled growler into a Treehouse tulip glass. The beer was kegged this morning so an IPA doesn't get much fresher than this. 
"Oh yeah! Just filled at the brewery about 2 hours ago... it's fantastic, can't wait to down this growler!"
"Picked up a fresh growler from the Tree House brewery. Split a growler with my wife, she had half in a Tree House Tulip, I'm reviewing from a Tree House goblet (only a few left, go get one!)."
Received as a birthday gift from BPK59 and poured into a tulip. Guess these guys only do growler fills on Saturdays. Secret recipe for this one I guess. Have a pretty good idea on the hop they used though.
750ml THB swing-top bottle filled at the brewery. 
West-coast IPA with no haze. Slight juicy/tropical/spicy nose. Mostly tropical juicy taste. Thinner on the mouthfeel as you would expect from a west coast IPA.
"Lightly-hazed, syrupy-looking orange-gold with a fat finger of antique white head. Thick rings of lacing."
"Gorgeous burnt orange color, very hazy, with a dense, sudsy light tan head. Wow. Juicy oranges on the nose, and there’s also an earthy, herbal note that is really cool. I am now drooling."
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a slight head and lacing
"The beer pours a some what hazy orange with a medium white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells dank, with citrus, orange pith, and herbs. It tastes of orange pith, citrus, herbs, and pine. The feel is medium, and smooth. A slightly fuller, more refined sip of sunshine. A great beer."
"16oz can purchased at the new brewery. Pours a slightly hazy brownish orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a blend of citrus fruits and herbal hops. Grapefruit and tangerine along with some pine and floral hops as well. The taste is grapefruit and sweet pine that blends into more herbal/floral hop flavors. Tangerine, orange peel and pine finish. Oily mouthfeel with a medium to heavy body. Tastes pretty boozey."
Opaque dark orange appearance with a slight white head. Aroma is a prominent citrus hops. Taste is a very smooth citrus hops that is a perfect blend leaning toward grapefruit.
"Honey colored appearance, beautiful lacing on the glass. "
"04/2016 - this is delightful. Great aromas and flavors throughout, plus light pine, a touch bitter, and lingering floral and orange."
This was incredible. Creamy and super citrusy.
Enjoyed Sip of Sunshine much more but this is a very nice IPA. Enjoyed it in Canada at the lake so everything tastes great there. Great color and a very nice aroma of citrus.
"Hazy orange with a very large, off-white yellow-tinged foam settling very slowly in large round mounds, leaving thick sheets in uniform layers. Some chunks of sediment came out at full pour and the beer took on an unappetizing look from that point forward."
"Double Sunshine was near the top of my want list for a long time and it did not disappoint. This is pretty much my perfect double IPA - the malt backbone is perfectly balanced with the hops and it is a nice easy drinker, even at 8%. I loved Triple Sunshine, but I think this is even better."
"On-tap at Draught 55, New York, NY"
Not the biggest Lawson's IPA fan but this was my favorite thus far by them.
"This was poured into a Lawson’s tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange almost brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that concaved gracefully to leave some bubbles inside of a thin white cap. The smell starts off with a sweet onion up front and then some light tropical fruits and a delicate sweet and bitter sprucy piney stickiness. The taste was mainly bitter backed up by a light sweet tropical fruit revolving around the pine. Bitter sticky piney-ness leading into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a good sipping quality and a danky sweet stickiness clinging to my tongue. Some slight hop oils lay down to want to allow a certain slick feel, but still indicates a well balanced oily to slick and clinginess on my tongue. Overall, what a wonderful DIPA that I know I would have again."
"I put this beer as Lawson's number 2 ... Triple sunshine, Double sunshine, SOS, followed of course by many many other great new England IPA's. This beers has a golden glow, sticky honeycomb lacing, and nice hop oils that slowly drizzle down the glass throughout. Tropical fruit flavor and pineapple grapefruit nose, with a nice medium to full mouth feel. Make this a must try if you like the NE style!"
22oz bottle poured into a Teku.
"drank this one the day of purchase, after buying at the first retail location these were delivered to. "
5
Drank 05-14-16.
"Good beer, clear and clean and super dank. It was not as juicy as other NE beers and did not have as good of mouthfeel. Overall a classic IPA and very good"
"Had this at the West Coast v East Coast event in Denver (Oct. 16). I don't think this was the freshest version of Double Sip as it was a little malty. It was really good, but didn't move me like I had hoped."
Was lucky enough to score a bomber on my last trip to VT.
"Extremely malty, to a fault for a DIPA. I had the August 2016 bottling within a week from the release. By far the biggest disappointment IPA type beer that I've had."
"Hoppy tropical booze-juice. First had this beer years ago side-by-side on tap with Heady Topper and HF Double Citra at Prohibition Pig in VT, and Double Sunshine blew them both away. Drinking it again from the bottle I can see what it has on those -- a richness and warmth that fills all of your senses. A notable DIPA."
Pours a hazy orange with an almost white foam.
"Bomber. Pours deep orange, finger white head fades to a ring, soapy lace. Sweet citrusy aroma, mild ripe tropical fruit. Delish tropical fruit citrusy taste, touch of ripe fruit, dank piney woodsy hops, perfect balance. Soft creamy mouthfeel. Incredible brew, met the high expectations."
Interesting
"Sip of Sunshine is still #1 but, the double comes surprisingly close. Must be had fresh to capture all the sunny goodness."
This beer pours an almost clear amber with a nice thick head and plenty of lacing. The smell is fantastic. All of the tropical and citrus smell with some pineapple and mango. The flavor is just as great as the smell. Lots of pineapple and mango with some grapefruit bitterness. Overall this is up there with the best IPAs I have tried.
"Like trying to explain sunshine on a summer day, with no chores! You just have to try it!"
Hop profile seems a little different compared to sip of sunshine. Papaya and pineapple on the front end followed by resinous hop bitterness. Decent offering.
This beer was not one of the better doubles I've had. It was a bit too boozy for me. It was pretty good but I'd rather have Heady Topper or Sips of Sunshine. Good beer though.
This is stellar. It's everything sip of sunshine wants to be. It's right up there with the elite iipas. It's a melange of overripe passion fruits. Mild bitterness. Treehouse level mouthfeel.
8th Anniversary bottle acquired via trade.
had at Lawson's 8th anniversary on tap;
Bottle purchased 4/9/16 at Lawson's 8th Anniversary Sale. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass (but of course).
"Very good. Sweet, northeastern ipa goodness. May actually prefer sip of sunshine but we're talking about ""do you prefer the best or the best"". Would buy truck loads of this if possible."
"This is the best double IPA out there in my opinion. Sip of Sunshine is a very worthy replacement for it, but double sunshine was everything I want from an IPA. The dankness of heady with the brightness of SOS. Edges out Abner as my favorite double IPA. Pumped I finally got to try it."
Fresh on tap at the Lawson's 8th Anniversary party. Great color and flavor. Blows regular Sip and Triple Sunshine out of the water. Looking forward to cracking the bottles of this.
22oz. bottle poured into snifter.
Finally had one and it was worth the weight. The smell was fantastic. Pine and citrus truly shine through here. SOS on steroids. Wasn't easy to find but I would get it again in a heartbeat. Don't pass this one up.
"Bottle poured into a snifter glass with a hazy copper color (not too dark though) with a decent amount of white frothy head. There is a good amount of lacing as the head subsides. The aroma was straight dank; you get a lot of pine and citrus with this one. The taste pretty much follows suit with a nice even balance throughout the whole bottle. The mouth feel has solid carbonation (not too much, not too little) with a slight dry finish on the palate. The hype surrounding this beer is definitely real. Lawson's totally delivered with this one!! Cheers!"
"Not sure if there was something off with this batch, but it was not the beer most people remembered at a blind tasting. In fact, it finished at the bottom of 15 other top flight double IPAs."
"Acquired via trade and was told it was from a ""recent batch"", no bottle date, so I really don't know how fresh this was. Interesting citrus aroma/taste, but overall, I found this very disappointing. This was by no means a standout double IPA, very underwhelming. I shared the bottle with 2 friends that agreed that this just wasn't very good. I'd be very interested to try this again, knowing that the bottle was fresh, but until then, my rating will stand as-is."
Pours an amber color. Great citrus and orange smell. Perfect combo of sweet and hoppy with a bit of resin/pine after taste. Awesome beer glad I traded for it.
"Pours bright orange, hazy, unfiltered with a one finger head. Smells of sweet orange and citrus, floral. Taste is sweet and smooth, with a caramel sort-of malt. Hoppier than Sip of Sunshine for sure. Finish is dry and bitter. Overall, pretty good. Well above average, but for Lawson's -- they've done better. I may actually take a standard Sip of Sunshine over this beer. I think the Triple Sunshine stood out a bit more than this as well. Still... a nice DIPA, and I'm really glad to have tried it."
"Received it in a trade. Probably had to give up too much for it, but nonetheless, it's a fantastic beer. Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass. Decent amount of foam and lacing. Smell is hoppy and floral and the taste matches. Both bitter and sweet on the tongue. Thoroughly enjoy it. Would certainly drink again (psyched I have a second bottle)."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. Right up there with good morning, Focal Banger and triple sunshine. Extremely soft/fluffy mouthfeel, very easy to drink and just an absolute juicebomb of a beer. Wish this was more readily available!"
"To be brutally honest Double Sunshine is a darn good beer...but it ends there. Drove to Winooski, waited in line from just after 5a to secure my bottle (HT and Sip too) and this just missed the mark for me. A bit muted compared with the other ales I've had from Lawsons. Having had Kiwi and Triple Play on multiple occasions, which I would stand in the cold to get again, the DS was meh."
"A - Amberish in color, not very cloudy. Filtered. "
Tons of tropical flavor. Super juicy and well balanced.
Had this for the first time tonight and WOW. This is a perfect beer in my opinion. I'm a huge ipa/dipa fan and this stands alone. I love Heady topper and it would be a mistake to compare it with double sunshine because they are completely different. This beer has a ton of fruit and floral on the nose and very full mouthfeel. Amazing. I'm glad I have two more to savor. Seek this out!
"This is one of the better beers I've ever had. I prefer it to Lawson's Sip of Sunshine. For me, the nose is much cleaner and the after taste brighter, more floral, and cleaner. Its floral notes are strong but perfectly balanced, and the hops are not overpowering. Perfect IPA."
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Lawson's tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. 
Poured from a 22 oz bomber with no discernible bottling date.
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Overall, a great DIPA - extremely well balanced elite mouthfeel keeps you coming back for more. One of, if not the, most balanced DIPA I have had the pleasure to try!"
"Released Nov 12, 2015, opened Nov 21, 2015"
"So nice to revisit last night after a long absence. Wish it were available more often. Wonderful beer. One of my top 5 DIPAs. More juicy than heady. More dank than haze. It's a nice combination of tropical and resiny. Classic Lawson's mouthfeel. Nose isn't social and it's a tiny bit too sweet for me, but otherwise almost perfect."
L-The pour is cloudy and golden. The head is immense and makes me wait for it recede to finish my pour.
Very traditional look. Bronze orange one finger head that stays very well. Elite lacing. Great clean hop smell. Get the scent from a few feet away. Noticeable malt backbone. A dank resin on the taste and feel. Some orange & peel. A little juicy and a little sticky. Medium carbonation.
"Bomber bought at Winooski Beverage Warehouse. This was poured into a Lawson’s tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange almost brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that concaved gracefully to leave some bubbles inside of a thin white cap. The smell starts off with a sweet onion up front and then some light tropical fruits and a delicate sweet and bitter sprucy piney stickiness. The taste was mainly bitter backed up by a light sweet tropical fruit revolving around the pine. Bitter sticky piney-ness leading into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a good sipping quality and a danky sweet stickiness clinging to my tongue. Some slight hop oils lay down to want to allow a certain slick feel, but still indicates a well balanced oily to slick and clinginess on my tongue. Overall, what a wonderful DIPA that I know I would have again."
Excellent brew. Wonderfully smooth and easy to drink. Go's down nice and full of flavor. I had several of Lawsons brews on a recent VT run and this was my fave. Would certainly enjoy on my next VT pilgimmage.
"One of the DIPA's that started it all for me. Had it after a Heady, and loved the different hop flavor, so much citrus, both on the nose and palette."
"Yeah, it's that fucking good."
I give this beer 5's across the board. It is so delicious and just a fantastic DIPA . A must have if you can find it !
"Perfectly balanced beer. Not too hoppy, not too sweet. Perfect mouthfeel. Only wish it was more accessible."
Fantastic!!! Loved this beer. It was very fresh when consumed as well
One of my favorite beers
Strong hops. Thick flavor. Citrus hints.
belive the hype its that good.
"An amazing beer. What all DIPA's should aspire to. Amazing aroma, smooth taste. Perfection."
Bottle shared by Seth. Clear pale yellow pour. Grapefruity hop aromas. Super dry with floral and herbal notes. A little unbalanced. Above average body. Average mouthfeel. Didn't quite live up to all the hype.
"Hazy dark orange body, three fingers of pure white level foam, plenty of carbonation streams. Lacing is a perfect film."
"the nectar of the gods. This blows away Heady Topper, and Heady is one of the best beers I've ever had. Truly the most amazing beer i have ever had."
This beer gets better with each pour out of the bomber. I enjoyed this cherry popping session more than the one I had w/ HT. Cheers!
double sunshine - lawson's finest liquids double ipa
This must be what melted gold tastes like. This is THE BEST beer I've ever had. Better than Heady Topper and that beer is insanely delicious. So lucky to have the ability to enjoy them both.
On tap at Hen in the Woods restaurant in Burlington.
"Gorgeous orange body with a soapy white head. Lingering aroma of citrus, tropical fruits, cantaloupe, really fruity with some dank aromas too. Flavor is terrific. Hops come through in a big way with all of the fruity hop flavors playing off of each other, but the kicker is a great toasty malt flavor. It sneaks in just enough to balance this one out nicely, but it is definitely a tremendously hoppy and bitter DIPA. Drinks great too, with a nice light body, but huge flavor. Damn this is good."
"Hands down one of the best beers I've ever had, stands up right next to Heady in it's own right (IMVHO). "
Gives Heady a competitor
"Perfect. Great balance of ipa with frontal hops no bitter, nice lace in glass."
From a bomber in trade
Sample from a 22oz bottle. Thanks Clint for sharing!
"Double Sunshine was my favorite beer for years; the handful of golden batches that Lawson produced in bombers, sampled between the spring of 2013 and the summer of 2014, were the finest examples of what craft beer had to offer. Double Sunshine was -then- without a doubt, the best DIPA in the world. It was as close to a 5-out-of-5 beer "
"Great color on this beer that makes you think its gonna taste very tropical and delicious and it does not dissapoint. Amazing beer super well rounded, has tons of tropical fruit notes but also has great pine/resin notes in there as well, enough of a malt backbone to make this beer super drinkable and it finishes eaassyy...love this stuff"
"Bottle poured into a Spiegelau glass, compliments of BRClemons - thanks for this one Brady!"
I'm going back and reviewing some of my favorite beers I've had since my previous ratings now mean nothing. Double Sunshine is top 3 beer I've ever had in my life.
"Poured from gold foil capped bottle into tulip glass. Poured a nice medium amber color with excellent clarity for the first pour. Thin white head with nice carbonation. Later pours were quite cloudy. The hops really come through in the nose, with nice citrus, tropical, and pine scents. The taste is phenomenal with tons of tropical fruit, balanced malt, and a very slight bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel was very refreshing and crisp. This is an extremely well balanced IPA that matches its description perfectly."
"This is just remarkable beer. It also points out how two beers can be so different yet equally fantastic despite being same category. Hazy apricot and gold pour. Fine carbonation that dissipates and leaves a light lacing along the surface of the beer. In both taste and smell, it is the anti-Heady and I don't mean that one is better than the other. All soft tropical fruits jumping out of the glass. Mango, pineapple, floral a bit. Just soft and gorgeous. Taste and mouthfeel follow perfectly. Again nothing similar to the in your face hops of Heady. Just soft and gorgeous hops layering on the tongue. So happy to have had the opportunity to try this marvelous beer. Seek it out, trade for it and savor it n"
Amazing surprise beer included in a box from TheSevenDuffs.
"The appearance is a Dark orange, like an apricot, with a white mist of light bright white foam."
"Probably one of the most perfect IPAs (with the exception of Ephraim) out there. The smell is amazing. Strong grapefruit and tropical fruits aromas. The taste does not disappoint, you taste exactly what you smell. The mouthfeel I think is what makes this beer awesome. A creamy, silky, yet slightly stickiness that lingers. Beautiful color and cloudiness. Unbelievable, this beer has ruined all IPAs for me. Nothing will ever compare."
"Tried twice, once poured from a bottle into a tulip, another time served on tap at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier."
"Discovered on accident at the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier. We went in hoping for Heady, and while they had just ran out, the disappointment did not last long, as the bartender suggested this fine DIPA to us as a consolation prize."
One of the finest beers I have ever tasted. We came up for the lawsons anniversary and tried many of the best beers in the world at hill farmstead and alchemist. I have now had all of the top 10 except VBDL. I think this is my new favorite. Sunshine is the best of the 8 or so lawsons I tried this weekend.
A: Golden slightly hazy beautiful white head nice lacing
"a - Bomber to snifter, 2 finger white head left some soapy lacing, color is orange/yellowish , a bit cloudy"
Appearance - Hazy golden appearance
"Bottle received in trade. Pours a slight murky golden color. Nose is a big herbal, resiny, and fruity smell. Taste is similar with the slightly bitter herbal and resiny taste but with sweet fruit notes. Overall one of the best IIPA's I've ever had. Can't find a fault with it honestly"
Had the pleasure of having it on both tap and from the bottle. First off let me say the drive to the warren country store and fighting the line is definitely worth it. Like others have said it is the exact opposite of heady topper but in the best way.
"This is the exact opposite of Heady. Do not drink this directly from the container. Good god, if you never listen to another word I say please pay attention now: do not drink this direct from the bottle. You will deprive yourself of the most heavenly IPA aroma any American brewer has ever before created."
Had the pleasure to drink Dbl Sunshine on tap at Mad River Glen in VT after a great day of skiing. This was the best the beer had ever tasted. Beautiful mandrine orange/gold appearance with a light fluffy mouthfeel and perfect notes of hoppy citrus. This batch put Double Sunshine ahead of Heady Topper for me...that good!
A: Pours a golden orange with a white foamy head that dissipates quickly. Solid lacing all down the sides.
Had this for my CBS. Craft Beer Sunday for March Madness.
Many thanks to Dereck for sending a couple bottles of this.
"I'll preface the review by saying that if you're a beer enthusiast and Vermont is within driving distance, albeit a trek, the hours spent in the car are worth the price of admission. Is it a double sunshine, or is it a solar flare in liquid form that just emptied into my Surly pint? Either way, this unfiltered masterpiece is looking more like a mimosa than a glass of beer. There's enough residual lace on my glass to give a dendrochronologist a beergasm. The nose on this (for me) is pretty straightforward: Juicy Fruit chewing gum and fresh cut grass. It tastes like a well-balanced mixture of tropical fruits with just enough malt backbone to give it that perfect kick. Not overly bitter, just exceptionally balanced and masterfully crafted. So smooth; so drinkable; the abv on this one is masked and then some. This is a stellar beer. Lawson's Finest has done what I'm sure numerous other brewers have attempted, but their labor of love is simply put -- better executed. To my fellow hop heads and self-professed IPA lovers, I implore you to seek out this beer. If it were more accessible, it would maintain a permanent residence in my fridge."
"Solid beer. Nothing more, nothing less. The hype surrounding this beer, all the ""juicy"" reviews had me expecting more. Don't get me wrong, good, but not great. "
I thought this beer would be more tropical. I think Lawson's has underwhelmed me on all the expectations I had for their beers. 
Poured from a 22oz bottle
"Had this on Tap at the Three Penny tap room in Montpeliet VT this weekend. Had a hard time decideing between the 3 different hill farmstead offerings, rising tide calcutta cutter, and Heady Topper but i was very happy i choose the Lawsons. To me this beer is a more well rounded heady topper. the taste has alot of simialarities but the mouthfeel of this beer is just so much better. The color was great and the aroma was out of this world. This beer is outstanding. So much going on with this one. Was blessed to get to try it on tap while i was there being the local bevy sold out of there delivery in 45 mins. If you are anywhere in the local viscinity of this beer on tap drop everything and get there if theres any left!"
S- Bomber bottle poured into a snifter
Bottled around 1/16. Poured from a bottle into a snifter. The appearance is hazy but nothing untypical of an unfiltered DIPA. A fellow taster noted that it's actually pretty clean for being unfiltered. Deep hazy yellow color with bright white head. Smell is of tropical and citrus hops. The taste is the same. Very hoppy yet very balanced. This beer finishes really hoppy yet not too bitter. Hops linger on the tongue reminding you how delicious it is and leaves you wanting more. The perfect Double IPA!
"A: Pours a clear golden orange color with a white foamy head on top, nice retention with streaky lacing all down the sides."
The beer comes in a hazy dark orange yellow color.
Served from a bomber into an Alchemist Will Becher glass.
"S- Pineapple, mango, some grapefruit. Maybe a little more subdued and maltier than expected at first, but this bad boy opens up well when it warms up. "
"About a Month old. Have had fresh ones and two months old, from what I rememeber I prefer the ""aged"" one. Let's see how this is. Pours a nice golden yellow, 2 finger bubbly head. The smell is so fruity. Tropical fruits and citrus dominate. The flavor is right there, too. Nice grapefruit and slight pine after taste. Creamy and somewhat thin. Goes down easy with almost no alcohol burn. I remember when fresh the alcohol is not noticeable. This is a great double ipa. It's very hop forward but also balanced nicely, with the malt taking a back seat."
bomber into a snifter. 
"I absolutely love this beer. I really can't find fault with it without sounding like some nitpicky douche bag. One of my favorite offerings from Lawson's, and one of my favorite beers on this entire planet of Earth. I only wish Sean would brew it more often."
"I drink this beer regularly as it is on tap at a local restaurant in my town. I have to say it is usually my go-to when I'm there, even though they have Heady Topper, I choose the Double Sunshine mostly because it's harder to get then Heady Topper. Though it is almost an even trade off between Heady Topper."
"Bottle shared with magictacosinus -- huge thanks to Steve_Oldrati for the trade/enabling me to get my hands on this one! Picked up from the farmer's market on December 21st, so my best guess put this at about 3 weeks of age."
Bottle about three weeks old 
A huge thanks to Josh for bringing this out and offering to share it - this has been one of my top wants for a very long time. Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a mini chalice. Bottling date is about 3 weeks old.
Poured from a bomber.
"This is an amazing double IPA. Surprisingly, I've found it gets even better with a couple months of age on it. It becomes even more delicious, with less of an alcohol burn, and less bitterness. If you've got a few, do yourself a favor and put one away for a month or two."
Its certainly special to revisit this beer. It had probably been two and a half years since a buddy in Burlington landed a bottle that I got to try. I certainly hope this gets brewed a bit more often. Tropicals are abundant and everything hits your nose and tongue and dances and sings and Lawsons is straight IPA heaven.
"This is a very top notch IPA and up there as one of my favorites. Poured from a 22oz bomber, it's got a orange color and is very clean and smooth looking. Looks very appetizing. Smell is one of my favorites of all time and where this beer shines. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit are all strong on the nose. Taste was very nice and herbal fruity. Mouthfeel was smooth and velvety with a little carbonation that dissipated quickly. If I get another chance, I'll definitely grab another bottle of this."
Poured from a 22oz bomber. It pours with a rich 2 finger head that hangs around for a while. The copper orange color seems to glisten in the glass.
"Very well crafted DIPA from the clean bodied appearance to the smooth mouthfeel. This is one of the most well-made DIPAs I've had. The mouthfeel is clean and smooth and allows all of the citrus and light pine notes to roll across the tongue. The hops are well in balance and the body is only there enough to carry them forward with a light sweetness. This DIPA is a bit sweeter than I expected and doesn't have the huge citrus punch of other world class DIPAs. Certainly worth a try, and much respect to Lawson's for their quality production."
"Pours dark orange with a foamy white head. Aroma of fresh herbal hops, exotic fruits, lemon, citrus, grapefruit, grass, pine and resin. Taste is hoppy, fruity and grassy with notes of herbal hops, grapefruit, bitterness and lemon. Finish is fruity, herbal and hoppy with loads of bitterness, grass, pine, resin, citrus and lemon. Nicely hopped, herbal and fruity DIPA. Well balanced."
"A regular brought in a bottle twice at Max's Hopfest (from notes, 8/16-18/13)"
"From the 10/12/13 release, so about two weeks old. Tulip glass."
"Thanks to Mikeypnh for the trade! Pours a hazy golden with thick white head that settles into a thin cap. Good retention and excellent lacing. As looks go, this is one good looking Imperial IPA. Lots going on in the aroma - tropical fruit, citrus, hints of pine and a distinct cat urine aroma. The best word to describe the nose - WOW! Sweet citrus hits the tongue first quickly followed by a strong hop bitterness in the middle and through the finish. All that Hoppiness is beautifully balanced by a solid malt backbone. Layered, complex, balanced, this IPA has it all. "

Double Sunshine by Sean Lawson is amazing.
Big props to BostonRyan to scoring some on a VT trip and sharing the love. 22 oz bottle 1 wk fresh poured into a Speigelau glass.
Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. This has a couple weeks of age on it.
"Got this from a verrry generous IP trade. Pours a hazy orange with a half inch tight, white head. Aroma was sweet grapefruit and malt. Taste was just amazing....Nice citrus, floral flavors. Finishes with a beautifully smooth maltiness. Trying not to fall too deeply in love as this is a tough get. Highly recommended to anyone venturing to the northern reaches of Vermont. Imagine; Double Sunshine, HT & HF within half an hour of each other....Wow."
"22oz. bomber bottle with a simple plain white label and some gold foil over the cap. The label has an oddly shaped but cool looking sun, 8 maple leafs, a brief description of the beer, and the mandatory US info. A bottled on or a best before date would have been nice. A beer this of this quality deserves a special glass so I poured it into my Hunahpu Snifter. "
Date: 09/16/13
"This is a very local Vermont beer, from one of best brewers in the state. It actually scored very high, from the six of us who judged it. Compared to Heady Topper, also a local beer, I rate Double Sunshine as a better beer. My feel is that it should be and would be in the top five if more people could get a chance to taste it. Hard to find and in very limited volume. But find it you must."

Thanks to ilovestouts for this!
A- cloudy and orange in color with a foamy white head
On-tap at Three Penny Taproom 8/31/13
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a great citrus nose..really nice. Very smooth IPA..not really bitter and very flavorful...lots of tastes and nice fruity notes. All around, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Fortunate enough to find some of this brew at the notorious Winooski Bevvy. At $10 a bomber, I figured it was worth a try. Served in a Fiddlehead snifter."
"A- Bright, hazy straw color with thick white head. Lacing lingers and head begins to slowly dissipate over a minute or two."
Serving: bottle
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, yellow-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, bright white head and a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. Nose of rich, floral hops on the forward nose, with a tangy grapefruit backbone blending with a truckload of resiny character. Layered and inviting nose. Wow! Flavors are smooth and balanced, with a grapefruit tart and sweet blending with a peppery and resiny hops character on the forward tongue. Some roast characteristics toward the end of the palate. The hops characteristics provide both floral aromas and bitter, resiny flavor characteristics. Fantastic. Robust body, but light at the same time. The aftertaste is richly sweet and bitter at the same time, with a heavy fistful of hops resin and citrus tenderizing your palate into a blissful state. Smooth, bitter finish with a slightly drying feel. Fantastic beer!"

"First had: I think on tap at Blackback, Waterbury, VT"
"On draft at The Farm House Tap and Grill, Burlington, NY. "
Poured into a Lawson’s chalice.
"I had heard so many things about this beer, that it seemed like that mythical pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Now after having the pleasure of partaking, I fully understand why it is held in such high regard! How fitting for it to be named Double Sunshine, it clearly shines twice as bright when compared to every other DIPA out there!"
Appearance: The honey colored liquid is capped by an impressive head that coats and laces like a champ

Lawson’s Finest Double Sunshine 
"Pours a hazy straw color, a touch of the orange you expect in big DIPA's, but noteably light in color. Nice creamy head!"
"Like most others, I have been seeking this beer for quite a long time, it wasn't until I made a recent trip up to Vermont that I stumbled upon it at a farmer's market. Anyways, on to the review..."
"L - even darker than Triple Sunshine (whoops drank that one first). More translucent, but still opaque. Dark, fossilized amber. Creamy head with densely-packes bubs. Leaves some serious lacing behind. "
"On tap at ACBF in Boston, MA out of a plastic tasting glass. Been looking forward to this one since they announced the line up and man it did not disappoint."
"This is an amazing brew! a citrus, orange aroma smacks you in the face when poured into the goblet. The appearance is very cloudy so this is the only drawback to this beer but really who cares what it looks like. The taste is legendary! Pliny, Heady, Abrasive status. This is a must seek, must have beer for any IPA lover. One of the finest, well crafted beers I have ever had...period!A crisp mouthfeel completes this truly incredible beer."
"Ive been wanting to try this one for awhile. Like most other elusive brews that trickle from the mountains of VT, my expectations are exaggerated beyond what is probably fair. However, this brew delivers the goods."
"Had this on tap at ACBF in Boston on June 1st. I tried every IPA there and some showed well but Double Sunshine was a stunner. I mean many 95-100 IPA's just paled in comparison. They seemed lackluster, which is a shame because alone they are excellent brews."
"I had this at ACBF on Friday and went back 4 times just to make sure I tried it enough to write a coherent and honest review about it. I truly cannot find anything wrong about this beer. When the person poured me my allotment each time, I kept getting blown away. The aroma is, honestly, the closet thing we have to 'Ambrosia'. Every fruit you can think of: pineapple, mango, papaya, cantaloupe, grapefruit. Its the same for the flavor profile."
"Another tasty creation from Lawsons finest. I have only had this once just because its hard to come by, seeming how the winooski beverage only lets you buy 1 bottle at a time and driving to warren is a pain. But the taste hits you in the face with massive hop notes and grapefruit after bite. I can't wait to get more of this beer."
Thanks to Kyle for this one. 22oz. bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303.

Review #1000. Woo.
"This sample was super-fresh, and poured into a Lawson's snifter a cloudy off orange/copper hue with a thin white head that dissapated relatively soon. The nose is a fresh mango that was dropped into a pile of fresh Vermont pine needles: immediately you get the sense that a taste explosion awaits you with such a marvelous aroma, and taste explosion is what you get!"
"Bottle from the March 1 bottling, reviewed on April 1."
Big thanks to my cousin Ben for grabbing this. Countdown to review 200!
HUGE thanks to franklinn for knocking out this bad boy... one of my very top wants.
A-golden amber color with a nice off-white head and good lacing
BIG BIG thanks to NYCBUCKEYE for this. been 2+ years in the making
Poured from the bottle into a goblet.
"Pours a hazy yellowish brown, yellow at the bottom of the glass fading to a murky brown color at the top, thick head with a bit of an orange tint."
"A: Poured from a bomber bottle into a stemless wine glass. Orange-marmalade in color with a hint of brown. 2-finger, frothy white head. Beautiful lacing."
"I dont feel as if I need to say much- best doub I have ever had. To me its even better than heady topper, although they are two entirely different doubs. More fruity than a heady- overwhelming mango and more subtle apricot and papaya notes whereas the heady has more of a citrusy pink grapefruit and tangerine taste. Extraordinarily well balanced with the perfect ratio of fruit and subtle citrus an pine resins followed by a supremely smooth hoppy taste. There is really nothing I would have changed in the brew and I plan to buy another 5 this Thursday at the Warren General Store. If you have the chance to get your hands on this unique brew in Warren then I highly recommend that you do so-I cant say there is anything more worth your time."
Bottle to Lawson's sniffer
"I've had a few fantastic Lawson's IPAs, but this appears to be their coup de gras! Lets see..."
"Got to try this at the bottle share during Hunahpu Day 2012. Thanks to all you guys at the J-Table that enabled me to try so many good brews, and had me wasted by 11 am. As for this brew, Heady Topper to date is my favorite ipa/dipa i've ever had. This is a very close second. Cheers"
"This poured out as a very nice looking yellow color with a fluffy white head on top. The head retention is strong and the lacing is very good too. The smell is loaded with floral, fruity and citrus aromas. The smell is almost addictive. The taste of the beer is solid as well, lots of piney citrus and melon flavors with a great malt backbone as well. The mouthfeel of the beer is very drinkable, soft and refreshing. Overall it's excellent. Very happy to have tried this beer finally."
"Tapped at 3pm on 3/2/2013 at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier. Served in a standard pint. Pours a light, golden-orange hue with a dense, half-inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Nose is fairly subdued with some light citrusy notes only really coming forth. Taste reveals citrus, buttermilk and an earthy/herbal quality. Finish expresses a slight biscuity character. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a creamy texture and a slightly oily quality. An easy drinking IPA, but not what I would consider a DIPA per se (perhaps it's the cask conditioning). I was lead to believe that Double Sunshine was a juicy DIPA loaded with fruit; however, I don't get this here. I'll have to see how the presentation in the bottle compares with the cask."
Logged from notes circa 7/22/2012
Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.
"Had this fine gem on tap in Waterbury, VT after hearing so many good things about it. I'm a lover of IPAs and this one ranks up there, Top 5 for me all time. Smell was a full floral scent, a mixture of hops and citrus. The taste was very similar to Heady Topper. If there are differences, they are slightly noticeable. Very light tasting with a slight bitterness to it but very well balanced. This is one of the best IPAs out there. Not quite better than Heady but I would definitely rank it above Pliny. Love this IPA and can't wait to have it again."
"This is a review for the 2015 batch. It is a completely different tasting, looking, and smelling beer than all previous batches. Disappointing. This is not double sunshine. Unfortunately, every bottle Ive had from this batch has been this way, and locals have all reported the same."
A: poured a golden orange in color with yellow highlights and a nice half finger of fluffy head that left plenty of lacing sticking to the glass.
I've had this beer many times..Best place to have it-on tap at the PIG.
"651mL gold foil thanks to dyan and oldsock/Mad Fermentationist. Pours a clear light gold. Spotty lace. Richer tangerine, mango pulp, papaya nose. Vanilla as well. Taste is rich, sugary, quenching. Palate is thick, no astringency. Mild macadamia nut fat. Nice. Jackfruit sugar, pith, and mild pina colata type white alcohol. 5/31/2012 8/3/7/4/15=3.7"

Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Beer pours a hazy golden yellow color with two fingers of soft billowy off white head. Head dissipates to a layer of bubbles leaving a bit of wide lacing. A good amount of fine carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass.

Thanks to Wowcoolman at Woodshop 7
"Bottle pour courtesy of Wowcoolman at Woodshop 7 held at Beachwood BBQ & Brewing in Long Beach, CA."
Poured into my Alpine Pint glass. A hazy and light orange color. Plenty of tiny carbonation bubbles and some particles of yeast float about this one and lead to a small two finger head that is off white in color and thin but on the creamy side in appearance. Lace sticks quite well in a continental way.
A-Pours a lightly hazed golden orange. Head is exact. Off-white and dense but still tall. This beer retains its cap perfectly. This surely looks the part; especially with the lacing it leaves.
"A fresh bomber poured into a Lawson's tulip glass. Pours a nice golden hue with a thick white head that leaves some amazing lacing. The aroma on this is galaxy, citra, and amarillo (or at least that's my best guess) - both sweet, citrusy (pineapple, grapefruit) and a solid dose of spring fir shoots. The flavors smack around and leave a bitter aftertaste that just makes me want to grab another sip - this is really a beautiful DIPA. I wish I'd been able to get more while I was at the Maple Tripple release."
Poured from bomber into Duvel Tulip - 2012 release. Thanks Kris !
A: Hazy orange body with two finger head. Lots of lacing. Great looking beer!
1385th Review on BA
"Pours hazy golden with a medium head that recedes extremely quickly to loose bubbles. Smells resiny and piney, with slight citrus. Overall, aroma is somewhat muted. Taking a sip.. whoa that is a mouthful of pine! Like walking through a pine forest and just biting into a branch. Finishes dry and strongly bitter, with an unusual astrigency felt on my inner lips."
"Unbelievable...I have to say (and I know this might sound crazy) but this beer is on par with RR's Pliny the Younger...so delicious and it has an incredible citrus smell and hoppy taste. I just hope it can make it's way down to Boston soon! Along with the Heady Topper, VT is cranking out some pretty stellar double IPAs."
"Hazy, uniform amber pour with a crown of fluffy white foam. There is excellent lacing and good head retention. The nose is purely sweet citrus fruit with a very subtle alcohol. The taste is far more intensly hoppy, almost too much at first. However, give the beer a chance to breathe and of course let that alcohol set in (/dissapate off into a warm summer breeze) and the beer changes. The sweetness comes in almost syrupy while your palate becomes quickly acclimated to the intense bitterness. Still though, it's hard to completely enjoy the grapefruit rind bitterness completely. Great beer, but it's a bit over the top."

Cloudy gold body with good head retention .
Consumed 6/14/12
"Appearance: Hazy, super hazy, dark gold. Head is bright-white, fluffy, and leaves some ridiculous lacing. Head drops to a thin cap, but some amount lingers for the duration. "
"Wow, seriously? Brewed out East, and holding its own against any beer without Pliny in its name? Thanks, Mike."
"Upon drinking this on tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington it struck me, not for the first time, that when beer is of this quality it’s merely taste which determines how one will rank it and where it should be put in our personal pantheon of any particular style. I was lucky enough to have this side by side with Hill Farmstead’s Abner and later that day, a very fresh can of Heady Topper. I’ve had Pliny and Blind Pig and multiple Alpine IPA’s, Surly’s Abrasive and Furious, and Double Sunshine was likely my favorite of all of them. They’re all phenomenal but on this particular day at least, I was completely blown away by how good this was. "
"I have been intrigued to try something from Lawsons as I keep hearing good things about that shop in Vermont which is home to my other favorite breweries such as Hill Farmstead and Alchemist. Poured from bomber into dimpled glass mug. Pours hazy orange with a beautiful thick white head that dissipates into thin lacing that lasts very well throughout. Aromas of sweet floral citrus, pineapple, and herbal hops. Sweet floral-like malts come out very well in the flavor along with some mango and pineapple. There is some dryness and delicious hop bitterness in the finish. A very pleasant DIPA and an excellent example for the style! Glad to have tried this one out."
"This bottle was courtesy of the infamous Adam Jackson, purchased last weekend. Thanks Adam!"
"Cloudy blond body topped by a thin head that recedes to a crown. Big pineapple nose backed by grapefruit and orange. Little malt presence. Tastes really nice; pineapple and grapefruit with some earthiness in the background. Body is light and malt is noticeable but integrated, slightly bready. A really good DIPA."
"picked this up last thursday at the warren store, this just a well rounded ipa, taste like the other vermont ipa's, like heady, hill farmstead, but does not have the smell of the heady topper,can not wait to drive buy again and pick up some more of this fantasic brew,this is a must try it beer if you like hoppy ipa beer"

"650 mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead tulip. I have a Lawson's pint glass, but I thought this deserved a better glass."
"Reviewing the Double Sunshine IPA from Lawson's Finest Liquids out of Vermont. This is one of the most sought after IPA in the county, along with Heady Topper, and it is not easy to get a hold of if you do not live near the three places that sell Lawson's beer. This is my first Lawson's beer and I am very excited to try it."

Golden yellow/orange body. A bit hazy with a nice sized white head. Decent amount of lacing and solid alcohol legs.
"pour is light golden peach, faint haze, tight white head. The nose is of tropical fruit and faint herbal note. Taste of light doughy malt, strong tropical citrusy fruit, notes of peaches, herbal vegetal I'm the back with an assertive bitterness and moderate carbonation. The body is oily medium body, slick on the back of the tongue bordering a nice velvety finish."
"Alec, you are the man for this one. Thanks a lot homey. Poured into a tulip. This one pours an orange yellow color with a small cap of thin white head and some thin lace. "

On tap at The Farmhouse Tap and Grille Burlington VT.
Bomber from the Warren Store. Didn't see a bottled on date but it was delivered and consumed yesterday so I can assume it was very fresh.
"What the hell!!! Incredible example of this style. Blew my socks off. Nice head after a rigorous pour, beatiful golden/copper color with an incredibly dankish, extremely basil aroma. Hops are well balanced and I hungered for the beer afterwards. Can't wait to get my hands on another one of these! Do not miss this beer."
"Pours a nice medium amber with a 1 finger head and decent lacing. A tropical hop bomb, with tons of pineapple/citrus flavor and aroma. Crystal malts take a back seat but lend a nice counterpoint to the hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable for a beer like this. A must-try! My favorite DIPA to date."

"On-tap at the Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. Stopped by with friends for dinner on the way back from Stowe, and damn this hit the spot. The body is on the lighter side for the style, which I prefer, and the hop character is heavy on floral citrus, with an earthy undertone. The hops vary between fruity and juicy to a more herbal lemon, with a hit of spice. Damn tasty overall. Very hoppy, but I could enjoy a few glasses. You should."

Awesome bottle thanks to shawnm213.
"MANY MANY THANKS to Beenitty. A surprise extra that landed on my porch earlier this afternoon, and something I have been wanting to try since I heard of it. Pours from bottle into Brooklyn tulip. Pours a cloudy very light yellow color- pretty unique looking for a IIPA, normally much darker of a color. nice head and decent retention, after a few minutes it recedes and leaves a sticky looking lacing around the glass. Smell- wow. a blast of citrus to the nostrils. Lemon zest, tropical flavors (mango, pineapple, papaya). Very herbal and clean smelling. This smells amazing. Taste- WOW. I am blown away. Just a blast of citrus on the front of the palate. Almost puckeringly citrus sourness, like biting into a lemon. It rounds out with some sweetness on the backbone that balances out the tropical fruit and citrus, leaving just a perfect mix of citrus sweetness on the end. No real bitterness here, the hops manifest themselves almost 100% in the form of fruit/citrus/tropical flavors and the sweetness that the malt delivers is just amazing. I just burped and up came some piney flavors. This is a perfect beer. Just absolutely amazing. Getting a 5 on all fronts from me, officially better than Pliney, and all the other elite IPA's I have ever had. I'm blown away by this beer."
"Presentation: Bomber bottle covered in yellow foil and served chilled into a pint glass. Phingdong was generous enough to share this with me, among many."
Huge thanks to koopa for sharing this one. 
"Pours a fantastic hazy yellow orange, reminding one of a sunshine. Really looks fantastic. The nose is tropical hops and a bit of malt. Really nice. The taste is where this beer really shines. A good, slightly tropical bitterness gives way to a piney hop finish. Just fantastic. The body is really solid with good carbonation. This just drinks like a dream. I have had a lot of IIPAs and this is one of the best."
This is a phenomenal ipa. This beer pours a golden yellow color with light orange hues. The smell is citrus and pine hops all rolled into one. The flavor is hugely hoppy with a real hop bite the citrus comes through first then the piney hops forward the middle followed by a bitter dry hop bite. This is the reason lawsons won the ipa crown. This beer has a nice light to medium body with good carbonations and a crisp bitter bite. Overall tied for my top two favorite ipas the other being Abner from hill farmstead.
Thanks a ton to PhingDong for helping me get this one. Happy Thanksgiving.
A - cloudy light orange color with little to no head on a solid pour
"enjoyed on-tap at the reservoir in waterbury, vt on 11/12/11."
"Tap at black back pub in Waterbury, VT."
On tap at the pub near the alchemist cannery. Poured into an Allagash tulip.
"I was very surprised and lucky that Tim (thegrogbog) pulled this out on a random weekday in northern OH (thanks so much Tim!). Bottle 137 from batch 196. This was many months old but tasted extremely fresh and hoppy, the miracle of modern refrigeration."

Rare Batch: 212 Bottle: 74 and 77
Served in a Lancaster shaker pint glass.
"A: Clear gold, like sunshine itself. Forms a smallish white head, but there is good retention and it leaves some clumpy lacing on the way down. "
"Bottle courtesy of gn0sis - thanks for the hookup. Batch 211, bottle 64. A gentle pour into a Fantome tulip yielded a billowing three fingers of creamy white head which desperately clung to the sides of the glass, leaving streaks of foamy lace as it gently receded. The beer was a slightly hazy golden color with a bit of an amber cast to it. The aroma emanating from the glass was incredibly enticing - deep resinous hops, tropical citrus fruits and a sweet malty grassiness."
"22oz bottle into Gulden Draak tulip. Batch 211, bottle 46. Huge thanks to SneezyAchew for sending this my way. This is apparently my 500th beer review. Let’s not get all mushy. "
"If you're reading reviews to see how good this beer is, just stop reading and find out how to get your hands on it. They'res alot of people saying that this beer is better than Pliny (i think so) Other people are saying Double Jack is equally good as this beer (not)."
Another quite nice beer from Vermont! Thanks to Michael- yourefragile for hooking me up big time here. 
"on-tap: review based on multiple samples at the ACBF (boston, 06/04/11). between this and the acer quercus i spent a good amount of time camped out in the lawson's line."
"simply put, the perfect beer. try it and try to disagree with me"
"Consumed 4/24/11, drank this with a few work buddies. Bottle got tossed so I can't remember the batch number, d'oh. Anyway, thanks Kelp and nathanjohnson for the chance to try this!"
"I've had this beer a handfull of times now, and it has grown on me throughout those tastings. I rarely get the chance to drink Lawson's, but this was from my third trip to the Warren store. Having had Chinooker'd, Hopzilla, and Triple Play at different times all before, Lawson's Finest Liquids has most probably become my favorite producer of IPA's and DIPA's."
"This review is dedicated to my bride. She hates long drives and agreed to make the PILGRIMAGE to Warren, VT to grab this bottle (and a few others!!) Thanks for making the drive! Cheers to you Melissa!"
Reviewed from notes at Friday's session of 2011 ACBF. Many times through the Lawson's line for this one.
Got this one in my poker winnings from baconsausage. Thanks a lot!
"Shared at Hill Farmstead gathering. Nice fruity aroma, so much tropical fruits (pinneaple, tangerine, mango) but also quite grassy and a nice cracker like malt balanced this one nicely. Superb aroma. This one is so drinkable and is very refreshing with all the fruits and grassiness."
"Rare Batch #211, Bottle #3."
OH.
"Props to Chris for this super fresh bottle, batch 192, bottle # 117... Pours a murky light gold, dark in the middle, a little ugly. A nice white head, great retention and lacing... The aroma is fantastic, so fresh, just plucked pine needles with pineapples and an assortment of tropical fruits... Taste is equally great, bitting pine and alcohol of a dipa, but muted and so drinkable. This is awesome, must try."
Big thanks to Tucker for this one! A bottle signed by the brewer received in the Too Many Rules BIF.
Thanks Brian for bringing a couple bottles to share! 
"Hazy orange juice colored with a thick, pillowy head just off white. No lace."
"22 oz botle, 8% abv. Bottle #94. Hazy gold, with a slight orange hue. Great fluffy white head. Great retention and lace. "
Big thanks to yourefragile for bringing this over to the end-of-law school tasting. This beer is incredible!
Appearance is a bright yet slightly hazy yellow brew. moderate head forms and falls back quickly.
"seriously one of the best beers i have had in the style, not even a question and by far the highlight of the bbq on thursday night. poured into a nonic and split with calton, this was a rare treat indeed."
"Big thanks to mikesgroove for dropping bombs on my palate during Hobo Cookout #1 and sharing this with me! Bottle #53 from Batch #174! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a two finger slightly off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of swee malt, mango, grapefruit, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, mango, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, and subtle marijuana. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Really great in all aspects on this one. The flavor completely floored me on how fresh and potent it was... Really glad I got the chance to try this one and if you have not, you should as well as it is definitely worth it!"
"22oz bottle batch #201 bottle #81 poured into Maudite stemmed glass, reviewed on 5/4/11"
"A - Pours a medium gold color, slightly hazy, good frothy carbonation that leaves a nice cap and some spotty lacing."
"Bottle shared by Chris, and again by Ethan - thanks! Poured into Lost Abbey Tumbler both times. Golden color with a slightly hazy yellow and a foamy white cap settles to collar. Smell is very tropical and sweet, really nice hop balance, very green and fresh, grassy slightly sweet malt in the back. Taste is very grassy followed by tons of tropical bitter hops, some sweet tropical fruit, pineapple, grapefruit citrus incredibly complex hop flavor. Medium body and medium carbonation with a somewhat dry flavor. Very solid ipa with a unique hop profile. I thoroughly enjoyed this, one of the most drinkable beers at 8% abv. Lawsons should cease production of about half their beers (I am looking at you, maple nipple) and produce this one year round. One of the best beers in the style."
Thanks to Chris (spycow) for sharing this one. Served in a Stone IRS tulip. Most recent batch (#192?) - two weeks old in any case.
So happy when I received this in the GIF I'm in. Thanks baconsausage
Thanks to spycow and the rest of the Chicago Crew for leaving me a tickable portion of this bottle.
"Bottle shared my the man that goes by Thorpe429, thanks!"
Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!
"Bottle shared by Thorpe recently, thanks. The few beers I've had from this brewery I've been impressed with. I'd like to get more of their IPAs to try. They seem to have that figured out well."
"From 03/19/11 notes. Bottled shared by Thorpe429; thanks Mike, always excited to try new Lawon's beers. Batch 192, bottle 88, poured into a tulip."
"Huge, huge thanks to imagineiii for sending this bottle my way. I've been looking to try this for awhile now. Served in a Bruery tulip."
"Picked up this bottle at the Cap City Farmers' Market, 1/22/11. Batch #183."
22oz freshie courtesy of BA hophead0808..Thanks!
Jrae2424 hooked this one up... I shared with a couple of peeps over the weekend... Thanks a ton Jason... there were some eyes opened to the potential of this small brewery.
"Batch 192, as fresh as can be, delivered to the Warren Store today."
Appearance: Cloudy - suspect it's from all of the dank Hops!
22oz bottle from the Warren Store. Review from tasting yesterday.
Pours a yellowish-gold color with a frothy head.
Thanks to baconsausage for my first taste of Lawson's. I've been digging these tiny breweries lately & more excited to try their stuff than most saltwater amphibians. Shared with my wife as the last beer on a quiet Friday night after an afternoon of ice fishing. 
This was my second sample of this delicious brew....first was due to a very generous BA who shared at Capone's Hill Farmstead Event. Big thanks to another great BA who traded me this bomber.
"22 oz bottle, batch 183, bottle 99. Thanks Conor and TCassel! Shared with Jeff and Ben."
"Provided by Michael and also split with Ben, thanks for providing this rarity!"
Big thanks to kingcrowing for hooking me up with this brew. Cheers Nick!
"22oz brown glass pry-top bottle with gold foil. Rare Batch #183, Bottle #62."
The color of this beer is of a nice golden sunshine hue. The head is a nice finger. finger and a half. White that dissipates slowly and leaves it self on the side of the glass as you drink. 
A: golden yellow with good clarity and a good amount of rising carbonation. Good level of head that holds well. lacing is good but not great.
I think this is one of only 3 reviews that I gave a full 5 stars on.
"I understand most west coast beer geeks believe they have a lock on the best IIPA's and they are mostly right. Lawson's is so small, lack of distribution will never impact enough left coast taste buds to alter that wide held notion. BUT, if you get a hold of this one, expect the best!"
"Bottle #3! Thanks ATLBeerdog. A quickie, 'cause we have lots to drink."
"This will be my first Lawson's beer. Heard great things about this brewery. Glad to finally have some of their beers to try. 22oz bottle, bottle 86 of 174..."
Portsmouth brew pub glassful- soft pour still produced a big white lacing head. 
"Poured from a bomber into a DFH shaped pint glass. The beer pours a nice hazy glowing orange with a one finger foamy white head. The head quickly fades to a tight ring, leaving oily lacing on the walls of the glass."
22oz bomber poured into a Duvel tulip.
"From a tulip glass, maybe two weeks old and kept cold. At one point, this was my favorite beer from Tree House (and therefore in the world). This time, the beer is amazing, but it's not screaming ""I'm better than all other Tree House beers."" If you can get it, get as much as you can. It's fruity, but not overly so. It's balanced … close to perfect and amazing. But I won't drive 3 hours round-trip for 8 of these if, on another day, I can get 24 of some of the other selections."
Very smooth and hoppy characteristics!
"Picked-up eight cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton on Saturday. My 19th beer reviewed from these guys. This is one of my favorites. Very smooth, does not go down like 8.2."
Drank out of the can on Halloween night. Quite delicious with a slightly bitter finish.
Pours a super hazy orange with half as finger of white head.
"Pours a cloudy orange with a one inch white head that left ample lacing. Smells of tropical fruits with a hint of pine and citrus.. Tastes of overripe peach and mango, papaya, orange, a bit of orange zest, sweet malts and pine. Medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy mouth feel, finishes slightly dry and bitter."
Goddamnit.
Very solid double IPA. Basically doppelgänger with more hops. Extremely well balanced and soft. An amazing beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and balanced with crispness and cirtus.
"Week old can of this stuff. Typical Tree House IPA look but two shades deeper in its hazy peach tone. Thinner head than many other of their IPA's. Similar citrusy smell as all other Tree House IPA's. At first sip though you can taste the power of this beer. It has a strong first attack on the pallet. Not too much bitterness in the aftertaste... or if it is, it is overwhelmed by the lingering power of the first attack. Medium amount of tiny carbonation. All in all, not bad."
TREE HOUSE DOUBLEGANGER DIPA 9/30/18
Poured into a tulup glass via can from TH 9/20/2018
"12/2016 - What a lovely upgrade from Doppelgänger! The nose is fruity and full of Mosaic, Citra, and general greatness; the palate is semisweet, juicy, a bit creamy, and just delicious. Very enjoyable finish!"
"a: super hazy orange/caramel color with some brighter notes towards the center of the glass. large, 2-3 finger frothy white head"
"Shared with my beautiful wife, Lauren."
"Deep golden wheat hue, piney smell. Notes of sap and grass. Bright hops and a nice bitter aftertaste."
Canned 8/3/18
"No beer has made me aware of hop utilization like Doubleganger has. Every since ounce of character from each hop seems to be squeezed into this beer. The result is, as far as I'm concerned, the best beer from Tree House"
"I came across a can of Doubleganger while traveling around Boston - I had worked out a trade, and was quite psyched to try the beer. But I made a very sad mistake in leaving the can loose in my rental car's trunk. Let me tell you - driving in Boston is not wise with unsecured alcohol. So when I drove out to Tree House, I found my can of Doubleganger with a pinhole, spraying a fine mist of beer in to my trunk. Sad way to drink the beer, but I shared it with a random nice guy in the parking lot."
got this gem off of a trade. The primary thing that stands out to me is the alcohol content compared to the taste. It is so smooth for a 8.2%. This brew goes down so easy even in the hot summer months. In all reality Treehouse brews are all similar meaning decently high alcohol content with delicious tropical notes combined with unparalleled drinkability. This one is no different. Well done!
"Picked up two cans. NE DIPA, bitterness does come through so I wouldn't say this is better than other breweries' version of the style."
This is exactly like dopple.
From a can dated 6/6/18 poured into a Tree House tumbler. 
Can stamped 05/16/18 (purchased 5/11 - date code error)
Still think this is their best IPA. Looks like straight orange juice in the glass and smells like dried mangos. Super soft and just a tropical fruit burst of flavor.
This should be a top 5 beer
Should give this all five’s but I want to leave room in case there is a beer that is better. If there is it will prob be a treehouse beer. My favorite from them is the Alter Ego. From there I would say that my second is the Doppleganger(should just admit this is better but the lower abv of the AE balances as a perfect beer IMO. Throw that all out the window because the DG is pure heaven in this treehouse category. I put these into a group because doppelgänger is the imperial version of AE and DG is a version made by God’s ? I’m asking cause I don’t know.
"This is a special beer from first sip to last. Complexity shifts citrus and tropical flavors. The deep golden hazy grapefruit juice look lets you know you're in for an elevated beer-drinking experience. Drink this and say, ""Aaaaah!"""
"Great IPA, there is the classic tree house flavor in this beer but it is taken to the next level with the additi9n of additional hops. There is incredible citrus, pine, and stone fruit flavors on top of the biscuit and earth the malt brings. Worth seeking out, one of the better IPAs to come out of Tree House."
Classic Tree House NEIPA hazy orange look with a finger of head that dissipates rather quickly to a covering. Peach and Mango on the nose. Smooth taste with very little bitterness. Super creamy mouthfeel.
"Canned on 1/30/18, consumed on 3/17/18, making this about 6 weeks old."
Poured from can dated 02/02/18 “New England vs Everybody” An incredible fruit explosion. Nose and taste espouse mango/melon/grapefruit and OJ with a hint of straw and resin on the back end for full balance. Mouth features perfect carbonation levels to keep it light and fluffy but is also smoothie like as it envelopes and coats the inside of your entire mouth...think Very Green in this aspect. My most favorite Tree House beer burps to date.
"Canned on 02/02/18, 11:13:47, ‘NEW ENGLAND VS. EVERYBODY’."
"Thanks to rudzud, unfortunate events kept him from getting this to me too fresh, but canned 1/30/18 not too bad"
Look: Yellow hazy with big fluffy white head. Has medium low carbonation.
This is the best nose on a beer I’ve ever encountered. It’s one of those beers that you smell and the only thing you can do is laugh. 
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a mild hoppy with a very nice amount of grapefruit that blends well. Taste is an exceptional blend of hops and grapefruit.
Poured out of can into tulip glass. 
"Finally got some of this and since doppelganger is my favorite beer i have even higher hopes for this. Doing side by side with doppel this should be fun. Pour looks great wth hazy orange cloud sitting right there looking at me. Looks almost the same as doppel. The nose is sharp orange and grapefruit rind while the doppel is a little softer. Some light grassy notes seem to be floating in there as well. First sip..... mouthfeel is. Excellent. Coats the palate well. Taste is mild for about a milisecond then hits with incredible bitter orange and tangerine with strong mango, pineapple, quickly leading into splashes of tropical fruit juice and papaya that fade quickly and ends with dry bitterness. Not much aftertaste and that leaves you wanting more rather quickly. No alcohol noted by me. The flavors all become more well blended as the beer warms. This beer is a little more harsh than doubleganger with stronger flavors and less aftertaste. More in your face doesn't mean better though as doubleganger, being more subtle, has its own pluses. This beer is awsome and while it may have stronger and sharper flavors ,dopple has a softness to it that seems to play with my palate with more complexity. Overall get some if You can. Was worth every penny after freezing my butt off for 2 hours in 20 degree weather."
"This beer pours a super cloudy, completely opaque bright yellow orange color identical to OJ. The head is two fingers, creamy and off white. Retention is above average and there are tons of spots of lacing left all over the glass."
Picked some of these up at the brewery. 
"Look: Opaque, rich and orange. Poured from a black can with a canning from yesterday (1/30/2018). Fluffy light head with rich color and healthy carbonation."
"This is one of the best beers they make, a truly great double ipa"
"Treehouse does it again with the classic New England style DIPA- Hazy color, good lacing, creamy mouth feel, super juicy, and just damn good! Can hardly tell this bad boy is 8%! "
10/7/2017 @ MTKATL - Doppleganger's double twin who is not bashful about making his presence known. Great job TH!!
Simply worth it.
"The moment you pop the can open the aroma of fresh citrus envelops you - just like it does at the brewery. Very nice head, slightly cloudy and VERY orange. Wonderful, wonderful brew."
Doubbleganger 
Can from Eric
"pours out an absolutely beautiful deep hazed golden orange color, super fluffy bright white head with sudsy bubbles atop ... excellent retention and beautiful lacing. getting aroms of peach, bubblegum, mango, bright grapefruit. profile follows mostly, some bready malts showing up as well as a subtle bitterness on the finish. overall a bit restrained for a IIPA but well balanced and incredibly soft."
L: creamy NEIPA haze with a deep orange strong pour gave a nice 2 finger white head with strong lacey 
"16oz can, canned 9/22/2017, served in a stemmed glass exactly one week later. Pours a hazy orange-amber body, one and half finger thick, frothy white head, perfect retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell is rich tropical fruit, mango, grapefruit, light sugary caramel, papaya. It's quite bright and appetizing. Flavour is a smooth, rich combination of bright mango, grapefruit, tropical fruits on a light background of light caramel and biscuit. The hop aromatics are very much present on the palate, and it makes for a really nicely rounded juicy double IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, frothy but with a really nice mild zesty bitterness on the backend. Crisp yet slightly hefty and frothy on the finish. Another very good double IPA from New England, one of the better ones for sure, but certainly not the absolute end-all-be-all of IPAs."
"Canned 9/22/17; drank 9/29/17 @ the Yarchives. Opaque orange appearance. A rough pour yielded a nice white head; strong, frothy lace. Peach, pineapple, apple & faint wheat notes in the nose. Soft, medium mouthfeel. Peach & pineapple flavors up front; soft apple & faintly dry wheat notes on the finish. No booze heat. DIPA perfection; fruity, balanced & a joy to drink. Bravo."
"Typical orange toned look, fruity smell, outstanding taste, sweetish with a bit of tang, great feel, soft, coating the mouth completely...really good beer that can be drunk every day"
A: The prototypical hazey NEIPA from Tree House pour with a hefty head at first and later midsize bubble head with minimal lacing.
"Canned today, given to me by a friend..."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a treehouse tulip. Purchased at the brewery today.
"I don't know how they do it, but Tree House does it again with another seemingly perfect beer with the signature creaminess but unique tropical profile. Deep orange juice body, white head, massive lacing. Tropical as always but delicately layered where the creaminess deletes any possible bitterness. Tree House's talents truly shine here."
Perfect balance of juicy hops and roasted malts. Great amber color and a lovely creamy head. Nice lacing in the glass and the finishing notes are not over powering. Extremely crushable for a 7.8% beer.
"Not sure why I haven't thoroughly reviewed this beer yet as I've had it multiple times, including from Monson. This particular review may be my favorite version yet, maybe because I haven't had it in a while, maybe not. Maybe it just IS that good. My overall hasn't changed over the past 2 years though."
Best beer I've ever had hands down
"Pours a turbid bright golden color. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Flavor of papaya, mango and juicy citrus. Has a nice feel and overall pretty delicious."
"Poured a hazy orange into a tulip glass. The citrus smells that this beer has is insane...plenty of mango, orange, tangerine and pineapple notes. Such a smooth and citrusy mouthfeel with hardly any bitterness on the finish. The juiciness is there with every sip. It's hard to even taste the 8.2% of alcohol that this beer is supposed to have. The use of hops in this beer is nothing short of outstanding! It gets better with every sip especially as the beer warms up a bit. Overall this beer shines as one of the best dipa out there if not the best!! Tree House really out-did themselves in producing this amazing beer...A++"
"Pours an opaque, orange-juice color with a frothy, two fingers of off-white foam on top. Great head retention with a foamy layer and ring sticking around for quite some time. Lacing consumes the areas of glass that used to contain beer. Aroma is orange, clementine, and tangerine hops with biscuity, bready malts underneath. It has a fruit sweet aroma, and yet remains in check. Flavor profile features a massive load of hops - orange, clementine, tangerine, papaya, and mango with biscuit malts in the background. Hops are highlighted, but done exceptionally well. Everything blends together, working to form a massive hop bomb that refrains from just being a blast of flavor with no substance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, smooth feel. Overall, marvelous usage of hops. While its smaller brother - Doppelganger - comes off a little harsh at times, Doubleganger is the smooth talking older brother. Sublime smoothness combined with world class hop usage makes this one of the most delightful DIPAs to sip on for those seeking citrus, semi-sweet notes. "
top notch. Not as citrusy as haze and very hazy but smoother than green. dark cloud appearance and a nice medium bodied finish . world class for sure .
"Poured from the can into a tulip, consumed 12 days after canning. Tropical fruit, orange and tangerine. Milkshake consistency with a pillowy mouthfeel. A considerable step up from Alter Ego / Doppelganger."
"Doubleganger looks like a glass full of high-end creamed honey, with a solidly opaque dark orange body and a large, cream colored foam head that slowly descends, leaving fuzzy, beaten egg-white lace. The second pour leaves a nice and super thick, fluffy, pillowy uniform blanket."
One of the first NEIPAs I've had and this completely blew me away. This beer is the perfect combination of creamy and tropical and the mouthfeel was incredible. Each sip was like angels dancing on my taste buds and the nose was incredible.
last batches not as good as prior- score reduced
"Classic Treehouse color and vicious mouthfeel. A very pleasant malty backbone provides a nice foil to the juicy hops. A juicy mango nose and a long, long finish round out the experience. Fantastic!"
Canned one week ago. 
"As a new regular at treehouse brewery, I've been eagerly awaiting a special release like this. Doppleganger is my favorite of the treehouse regular offerings, so needless to say I was thrilled to get my hands on this as a secret co-release when I was only expecting dopple. The appearance is a similar full , hazy orange to dopple. Looks like mango juice. Smell is a blast of tropical fruits, mango and tangerine. Taste brings all the aforementioned attributes together. Creamy, mangoy, tropical with just the right amount of bitter, this is the best beer I have had from tree house, and probably the best I have ever had in general. Easy 5/5 for me."
From can into teku.
Simply amazing. Should be rated much higher on this lis
Hazy look that reminds me of pureed pumpkin - orange and viscus. 
mouthfeel is simply ridiculous
"This one pours a very hazy creamsicle orange, with a small head, and a good amount of lacing."
Wow!!!!!
Poured from a 16 oz. can dated 2-23-2017 (less than a week old) into a TH Teku goblet.
Canned 2/23/17. Reviewed 3/11/17.
Poured from a 16 oz can dated 02/23/17.
This beer needs a few weeks on it. That being said mother of god the depth of this beer is incredible and is easily up there for best beer TH makes.
Was lucky enough to score one from a buddy - 
5
unreal
"ILook: super hazy, super orange and not a bit of light passing though it, super creamy 1.5 inch head."
"A lot of mango like a lot of the Tree House I've had, the dry hopped adds an incredible taste to it. I was already a huge fan of Doppelganger and this just takes it to the next level."
Had Dec 29 (twenty days after its release)
Is Treehouse out to dominate the world? Seems like every beer they put out is better than the last. This is one legit brew. The mango shines. Feel is SO smoothe. Give me twenty more please!
Can poured into fluted snifter.
"Hazy, peach color in the glass. Amazing fruit character. Big tangerine and mango with pineapple, grapefruit, passion fruit, papaya, melon, strawberry. Very soft herbal note adds a vegetable bitterness to balance the juicy fruit. No malt. Finishes light and makes me want to drink more. Very crushable beer. My only complaint is the east coast IPAs tend to get a little watery toward the second half of the pour."
"L - Straight orange julius thick icky smoothie style look, beautiful."
Canned 12-09-16. Drank 12-19-16. Ooh La La.
This one needs to warm up a bit to shine.
"Somewhat murky hazy peach color. Aroma jumps out of the glass more than expected and is a nice surprise. This has much more intense hop character than most TH beers. Orange rind, citrus, mango, and somewhat green hop character. Little more bitterness as well but still relatively soft and hidden alcohol. I enjoyed this much more than doppelganger. Absolutely fantastic."
"It's a Tree House IPA so it can't help but be excellent. Somehow they all have their own character but still have the smell, taste, and mouthfeel that screams a TH offering. This has a citrus/mango flavor upfront, but has more resin in the mouthfeel than most TH IPAs. The finish has a hint of bitterness to balance the mango/peach flavors on the front."
"Yet another killer offering from Tree House. The usual - beautiful unfiltered orange color; HUGE tropical nose. Tons of concentrated tropical flavor --this is a case where the commercial description of flavor nails it cold. I might add some tangerine notes. Finished with the right amount of pithy bitterness. In my opinion, no one does that soft mouth feel better than TH. Bottom line - I think this one belongs in the conversation with the very best coming out of Monson. Given a choice, I might still reach for King JJJuliusss or Very Hazy first, but there would be a pause before I did so."
"This is almost like doppel but juicier, literally no bite that pillowy mouthfeel that pairs so well tropical fruitiness. Seriously, doppel was my favorite TH offering don't know how they managed to improve it"
"Pours a hazed yellow with a soapy head and lacing. Aroma of pineapple, oranges and dank herbs. The flavor follows the nose with tropical flavors much like a fruit punch but with some bitter hops in a balanced finish. Drinks like fruit juice with a light body and a medium level of carbonation. A nice dank east-coast IPA. Worthy."
"Pours the color and clarity of orange juice with a tight band of foam around the edges. Nose expresses orange juice with a hint of rind. Taste consistent with nose; however, more pith is present in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant acidity. Overall, a delicious DIPA. Pure juice with just a hint of rind."
"Another amazing beer. I could sit and smell this beer all day, so drinking it was a real treat. Tropical hoppy deliciousness."
"Had this against a bunch of other Tree House including Sap, Super Sap, Doppleganger and this one tasted the best. It was amazingly smooth. Great fruity smell. Very very tropical in taste. Really enjoyed this one a lot and wish I stood in line for it. Great smell. Taste was even better. Feel was juicy and smooth."
This might be the best Treehouse hops I have ever had...Right up there with Juice Machine and King Julius! Juicy dank and hazy as hell! Amazing brew! Glad I made the effort to track it down!
Canned 12/9
16oz can poured into a Teku.
So far this is the best beer I have ever had and I've had many of the best.
"Holy tropical bomb!!! Fresh can drank on 12/17/16. This has it all. A real nice amount of bitterness but the tropical flavors are bold, complex, deep, you name it. Treehouse knocked this one out of the park. Orange, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, mango, and more!"
"WOW got a hold of one can and drank out of glass, can these guys make a bad beer? look was the cloudiest, thickest orange juice with pulp looking beer I have ever seen. It poured thick and hardly moved, LOL. not sure why but not much of a scent when compared to other TH offerings, but a faint juice mango scent. Taste was awesome, for an 8.2 so balanced and not a trace of alcohol at all, the smoothest double out there and this creates a dilemma, so there can be doubles that pack a wallop and do not present the slightest sense alcohol? Plenty of mango, citrus and tropical fruit present as expected and feel is graceful and smooth sending a coating throughout the palate that sticks around and finishes with great length, an aftertaste not experienced with any other brewer and double for that matter, a must try as this presents a number a fine characteristics not found in any brewer."
Right up there with Very hazy among the best TH beers
"Got to give it a five. The color is a dark deep orange and the head is thick sticky and lasting. The nose is an instant blast of orange and pineapple, and the taste is tropical and intensely hoppy. Moderate to strong carbonation, thick smooth and tingly mouth feel. This one ranks up there with King JJJ!"
L - really nice sheen on the can. Slightly holographic shininess. I was just over in China and mango juice was all the rage. Coming out of the can was just that. Settles into a more brownish hazy yeasty creamy sunset orange. 
Bottle Date: growler 12/10/16
Canned 12/9/16. Consumed 12/13/16.
"Golden orange, fluffy head, smells like pineapple and orange, very bright, some subtle hints of mango. Taste is super orange, fruity and sweet, you get the stonefruit character from - undeniably - mosaic hops. It almost feels thick, like you are drinking orange juice. Not sure how they pulled that off."
An amazing beer. Cloudy with that strong fruity TH taste but with a bit more bitterness on the back. Perfect beer of old and new IPA styles.
"Doubleganger is outstanding, damn is that smooth. It tastes similar to C28 but on steroids with a huge juicy hop finish, that's balanced with this incredible dank flavor. Almost reminds me a little of sap but well rounded out and hazy juicy!!! "
"Look - Dark yellow/Orange color, murky, no light can pass through"
"Pours a very cloudy (opaque) deep straw color with nice one finger creamy head. Not a ton of retention but some nice sticky lacing. Aroma is peach, citrus and tropical fruit. I don't feel this is as ""dank"" as others. Flavor is very juicy with the typical TH fluffy mouthfeel. Just enough bitterness to balance it beautifully but no real lingering bitterness. Just enough to keep your palate fresh and eagerly awaiting the next sip. The alcohol is completely hidden. It is so drinkable that it would be very dangerous if you had an appreciable quantity. Another outstanding offering from Tree House. Thanks Nate!"
"Pours incredibly hazy, bownish-orange in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is peach met with wet delicious hops and some orange juice...Like the description says Doppleganger on steroids..wet hop and twice as much juice, Super dank, bitter, medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation..Great Tree House freshness and juice. I like this one better than Doppleganger but not as much as the the rest of the very series...So that makes this still great...Well worth trading for..Superb addition to the Tree House line up."
"The commercial description is right on here, though less tropical fruit and more dankness than advertised, which is not a bad thing at all. Delicious mouthfeel with a nice balance and a terrific finish that really warms in an amazing way. It's beers like this that prove how Treehouse is truly keeping the craft in craft beer."
Smell: Fills the room as soon as you pop that top 
"On tap at The Lark in East Northport, NY and it had good NE style IPA looks except the lacing was minimal. Smells super juicy and dank with tons of citrus fruit, but the flavor drops off a bit with less citrus intensity and plenty of sweetness from th caramel, toasted grains and graham cracker. It’s very smooth and easy to drink, but did not live up to the hype like it did the first time I had it 5 years ago."
"On tap at Jealous Monk. Pours a hazy dark orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Great aroma of citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple, grapefruit, lime, passionfruit, mango and orange. The taste is much like the aroma. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange and mango along with some herbal and dank hops. Some malts peak out at the finish along with the herbal hops. Boozier than expected. Oily mouthfeel with a medium body."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden color, minimal head. Citrusy hop aroma. Loads of flavors: mango, lemon, orange, slight dankness,, lingering biter finish. Overall a very well balanced DIPA."
"On tap, pours a moderately hazy deep orange. White foam head leaves good lacing. Smell and taste are packed with a complex array of fruit and pine. Easy drinker for the ABV. Kind of straddles the East Coast and West Coast IPA divide. Great, great beer."
Pours a nice white and creamy fluff head that dissipates quickly. Beer is a hazy light orange and looks good.
"What a pleasant surprise to see this available on draft at Ginger Man, NYC. So nice to luck into a hard to find and highly rated Ale. "
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Came in a tulip glass with about a quarter inch of head leaving behind light lacing. The aroma is floral and fruity and not too overwhelming. Taste is citrus forward with some resin at the end. Nice dipa."
Many thanks to Derek for the chance to try this beer.
500mL bottle dated 9/28/18 poured into a tulip
"05/2014 - huge aromas of floral, hops, pineapple, orange up front; the palate is vibrant and is fruity, hoppy, yet a lingering bit of pine; clean, mildly bitter finish. Incredible when fresh AF like this."
"The beer pours a hazy gold with a medium sized white fluffy head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of citrus, orange pith, pine, and caramel malt. It tastes of citrus, orange pith, pine, and caramel malt. The feel is medium. A great balanced ipa, very well done."
"Dated 8/31, poured into dinner glass"
Perfection
"Dank, yet smooth hoppiness. Extremely clean and well balanced. Its everything I expected and more. Truly goes toe-to-toe with Pliny."
"Challenging to review such a highly-rated beer. If you concur, you’re perhaps seen as bandwagoning. If you don’t, you’re at risk of just seeming contrarian. "
"Lovely honey orange color. Smells sweet, floral, and crisp, with a hint of tropical fruit. Goes down smooth, with a refreshing amount of carb, no bitterness, and no detectable alcohol. This is a fine example of just how damn good a beer can be."
"Stored at 48*F; bottle date ~March 29, 2018; poured into 16oz tulip (after turning the bottle upside-down for 60seconds)"
Wow...what a great beer!!! Smell/taste is amazing. Very little bitterness. Definitely at the top of my beer list now.
This beer is amazing for it's attention to detail. Hard to find a not hazy double IPA with this perfect of a hop profile. Super drinkable beer. I suggest having a whole bottle to yourself (or pint)
Smooth and a bit bitter...yet delicious!
"Maine Beer Company has been on my radar for quite some time - and Dinner has been a big want. For some reason, I'd thought that Dinner was more difficult to get (per a conversation at Surly Darkness Day)... but then, in a forum discussion, I'd heard that a friend had actually had a whole CASE delivered to his house. Say what???"
"The label matches the taste, clean and classy! The main thing that comes to mind here is balance. Great hops with mellow fruit and an absolutely killer smooth finish. Insanely crushable at 8% abv. Dinner might be the best beer I’ve ever had that could appeal to literally anyone who likes any subcategory of beer"
Probably the best hoppy beer that I’ve ever had. Both the nose and the flavor is a seemingly perfect mix of dankness and fruit. Not super dry like some west coast versions and not a fruit bomb like the new NEIPAs. This is perfection.
Thanks to jhavs for this one! 16oz bottle poured into 12oz glass. Poured a cloudy yellow color with over an inch of white head that had decent retention and light lacing.
Bottled 10 days ago. 
This is what a DIPA should be. Sets the standard for a Double IPA. Well made. DRINK FRESH from the brewery.
Continually enjoyable beer but missing that special magic of the bigger IPAs
"Now this is how a DIIPA is supposed to look, smell and taste. Amazing. 5's across the board. Glad I got a chance to try it. Hope to get the chance again."
This was extremely hoppy and citrusy on the nose. Slightly bitter bite on the aftertaste.
"Very nice IPA---smooth and hoppy, excellent~!"
Bottle dated 12/09/2017. Thanks Jake.
good solid double IPA. fruity and aromatic.
Bottle from the October ‘17 release poured into tulip glass
Had this beer for the nth time last night. Amidst the rising tide of indistinguishable fruit-bomb NEIPA's Maine Beer co stays afloat! This is a beer that tastes like a beer. That does justice to its style. Drinking this reminds me why I love beer.
Poured into a 13 oz Funk Brewing Teku bottled on 10/14/17. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a massive 2 finger stick white head that leaves behind loads of thin webs of lace.
Finally checked this off my list.
Fruity and chewy really like this one.
great beer. but a bit pricey considering all the other more readily available choices out there .
16.9 bottle poured into a tulip
Not worth the hype or the hassle to acquire.
"Great lacing, thin cap. Slightly hazy light orange. Sharp aromas of fresh oramge, grapefruit rind, and some pine and cattiness (Simcoe?). Flavors follow with a big hit of citrus, medium low but present bitterness, and a long finish of orange and pine. Pretty dry and thin is the only real criticism, though I prefer less bitter. Really good all the way around, but decidedly not in in the super hazy NE IPA vein."
The perfect beer
"Very old bottle, so I'm assuming that my rating will jump up once I taste it fresh"
This beer was all I thought it would be and more.
Good! Amazing flavor yet easily drinkable.
"Tasted from bottle. Pours a super murky pale yellow with white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is big time tropical fruit with pineapple, melon, some orange, peach. Taste is an incredibly well balanced fruity bitterness. Flavors similar to the nose of tropical and citrus fruits along with some caramel. Top Notch IPA. Easily one of the best I've ever had."
"After two years of waiting, finally got to try this in a generous trade with my neighbor."
outstanding hoppy IPA.
A: a beautiful light burnt orange with slight haze a white head that fades rather quickly 
"Pours a golden straw color with hints of orange. Slightly hazy with a bright white head. Nose is dank, grasses and earth with light citrus. Reading the reviews of this I thought I might be in for a juicy beer but I'm not getting that. Getting a lot of earthyness, grasses, bark and Dankness. A bit of light fruityness to it but that is not the star. Medium bodied, low on bitterness. Finished fairly dry. Quality beer here."
"had this 2 days after bottle date, so super fresh. great golden orange haze with a fruity scent with a little apricot and orange undertones. Amazing taste as the fruitiness comes through subtly in the hoppy texture of the beer. even left my tongue and lips a little numb. had a bit of a lingering aftertaste, which was the only detraction I would have on this beer. really amazing brew!"
very good. smooth. no imperfections. taste could be better
"Golden orange color, hazy - not as turbid as some NEIPAs but not translucent by any means. This is a good looking beer."
"Pours golden orange. Nice one finger white head that fades quickly. Nice lacing. Light dank aroma. Taste of orange peel, citrus, apricot flesh and cantaloupe. Best one from Maine. Great beer. So easy to drink. It's dangerous."
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing the bottle
"Not worth the hype or the money. It's good for sure, but I wouldn't drive 6 hours and pay 100 bucks for 12 pints. That being said, it's delicious and worth trying."
"pour is hazy golden orange, bright white head, great retention and lacing."
"Aromatic, smooth, citrus, crisp. The most aromatic beer I've ever encountered. Bottled some time in the early AM of 4/29, picked up by at 7AM and enjoyed my first sip at 4PM...so this is as fresh as can be, and boy does it show. The aroma is out of this world - citrus, leafy hops and light pine explode out of the bottle and fill the air above it like a low-lying cloud over a mountaintop. Unreal. Nothing can quite live up to an aroma like this but the taste and feel come close. Orange rind, pineapple, fresh cut grapefruit, pine and a touch of lemon. Crisp and somehow light, despite its DIPA-appropriate 8% ABV; no alcohol heat to be found. The malt holds up the hop-onslaught but does nothing to balance the flavor profile. Finishes clean with a lingering earthy spiciness. 16.9 ounces disappears quickly...and the lottery looms large as the beer is a must-have."
"I worked a bit to secure this. Glad I put in the time and effort. It pours that beautiful golden straw color that I associate with world-class DIPA's, a bit murky, a finger plus of off-white head."
"I can say without hesitation that this is the best beer I've ever had. Poured into a Teku glass a golden amber color with a finger of laced white foam. Heavy mango and tropical fruit notes in the nose with a bit of pine & a touch of funk. This is a stellar example of the NE IPA revolution of the last several years. As an imperial, you can pick up on a bit of alcohol, but not in a way detrimental to the overall flavor profile of the beer. Not as juicy as other NE IPAs, but you can definitely pick up on more complexities that can be drowned out by juicier IPAs. Overall, incredibly well balanced from look to finish and everything in between. Definitely worth the hype."
"I didn't get the hype machine here. It's a very clean and tasty beer with pronounced hop flavor, but it's not very distinctive. Honestly, this should be produced and released more so the rarity won't influence reviews and interpretations. It's great, sure. I'd happily drink it again but I like Lunch just as much and can find that on draft without trading an arm or a leg."
"Is it worth the effort to get it? If you love Imperial IPAs, its a must try. Aromatic and smooth with citrus and mild piney flavors. Yes it's worth the effort...if you get into their lottery."
"Followed the directions on this beer and had it with dinner the other day. Simplistic feel with a dry, hoppy finish. Feels very smooth for a double but gives that nice bitter aftertaste."
wow i didn't realize this has been on my wants for 2 years. finally getting a crack at it. man i should have opened this side by side with pliny
Didn't write the review while having it but happy to finally check this one off the list. 
"Bottled dated 2-18-17 poured into a tulip. This beer has wowed me in every aspect and I've been waiting to try it for 2 years! The look is what I am trying to emulate on my homebrew DIPAs; light golden hazy color with a thick white head. Lacing sticks as you drink, leaving rings all the way to the bottom. It smells of rich and ripe tropical fruits, light dank, soft white bread. Tastes like it smells but in layers, fruits, dank, pine, bread, sooo good! Very balanced feel to it with a soft bite that fades when your ready for the next sip. Overall fantastic DIPA that I'll try to get a case of the next time sales are available. Seek this one out if your a hop head like me! Cheers."
"Yet another example of a hype beer that was quite good, but not as good as expected. MBC lives up to its reputation of making solid beers, but nothing earth-shattering. This was a solid DIPA, but something in those hops exude too much earthy onion and garlic to get past before you get any good resin or citrus notes. 2 bottles were mailed to me in Winter: I drank one and gave the other to a friend for her birthday. That's how little I cared. Lunch was better."
Draft to a tulip glass at the brewery.
Date on bottle: 021817
"Pours a hazy opaque orangey hue. Pillowy, cloudy head that you would totally sleep on because you would be smelling something so good in your dreams. Aromatic mango frooti. If y’all don’t know what that is, go to your local Patel Brothers and get some, may be you won’t have the beer, but you’ll have the aroma and flavor. "
Bottle on 11-11-16 poured into a snifter glass. About a 1 finger of white creamy head. 
"All I have had from Maine Beer Co (Peeper, Lunch, and Dinner) have been great, but this was my favorite."
Too smooth. Needs more bite.
Obviously near impossible to get but if you are lucky enough to have a taste....it's one of the best beers you will ever taste. Can we score over 100?
Amongst the best for me. 
One of the top IPAs I have ever had. Period. Excellent nose of tropical fruit that was completely backed up by the flavors on the palate. Great bitterness that melds very well with those tropical flavors as well. Lived up to the hype for me for sure. Delicious
Big thanks to mfurlone for a hop-for-hop trade early this month. 500ML bottle dated 8/20/16 with Maine’s trademark understated label. 
From bottle into a teku.
"Clear, amber pour, leads to notes of mixed citrus aromas. Nice balance of bitter hops, citrus, and malt. Carbonation helps move the flavors throughout pallate. Great beer, but there are better DIPA's with more bang for the buck out there."
"Pours a very dark amber with small white head. Clear pour, no turbidity. Very light citrus on the nose. Slight citrus notes on the taste with a clean/bitter finish. Overall I was a bit disappointed given how highly rated this beer was. Had alongside 7 other really highly rated IPA/DIPAs and it was towards the bottom of the list when compared to the others."
Finally got to try the rare and ellusive dinner. Thanks Kevin Bottled 8/20 drank on 9/5. 
Drank side by side with King Julius.
Finally got to try this last night - thanks Chet. When you have a big/hyped beer like this one you never know. Some beers go beyond the hype n blow you away while others fall short. This one .... was exactly as I expected. It was smooth and delicious. Didn't blow me away but I can see why its talked up so much. Very - very good. Would I wait in an insane line for it - not sure. But I'm glad some made its way back to NJ and into my fridge. Another whale off the list.
Bottle on 08/20/2016 (7 days old)
Bottled 8/20/16. Consumed 8/25/16.
Another great beer from the East Coast!
Bottle was a bit over a month old. Would be curious to try this fresh. Better than other Maine stuff for sure
Great hazy golden color. Wonderful nose of pineapple and melon. Same flavors on the taste with a balanced bitterness throughout. I think there is also a hint of maltiness. A very pleasant full feel with a pleasant effervescence. Fabulous beer!
"Great beer, Pours quite thick, much like a dense Orange Juice. Tastes like a top tier New England juicy IPA. It has many different flavor aspects which make it one of the most complex beers I have had the opportunity to try. While it may not be worth waiting in line overnight , It's absolutely worth trying."
"Look : Cloudy golden-bright orange color, white foamy head. - 4/5"
"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed goblet, the beer is a very bright, slightly hazed, orange-gold coloring with a low profile, filmy, clingy, white head. Aromas of bright and sweet citrus juice, heavy on tangerines and grapefruit, with a solid dose of dried grass and pine tassels. Wow! Flavors are bold and big on the forward tongue, heavy on bitter hops characteristics of pine pitch/resin, dried grass, and pepper spice, followed by a smooth and juicy blend of orange, grapefruit, and a mild tropical fruit blend. Perfectly balanced on a smooth, chewy body. The aftertaste is extremely hop heavy, with a lingering bitterness and a blend of grassy and piney notes, but also with a solid astringency and boozy characteristic, too. The finish is smooth, slick, and with a boozy bite. Amazing beer!"
Smell: so much pineapple some peach mango candy fruit some dankness.
"I've heard this beer is over-rated, and after trying it I completely disagree. Dinner is the best non-haze-bomb non-juice-bomb DIPA I've had. While I really like them, the hazy juicy northeastern IPA bombs are not for everybody ... Dinner is a DIPA that can be appreciated and admired by all DIPA drinkers. Without getting into the exact rating of this beer relative to others, it definitely belongs near the top of any list. Glad I tried it, and will always welcome another one. Look is light orange with moderate cloudiness, and fluffy white head that lasts through a good deal of the beer. The nose produces pineapple, mango, and general tropical fruit. Taste is fruity, moderately hoppy with moderate carbonation, and a nice full and smooth mouth feel."
"Dinner is cloudy yellow-orange, a really surprising attribute to me for a Maine beer, which are usually very clean, sparkling and clear brews, but I guess keeping the hop oils in order to amp up those flavors and aromas will do that. Dinner displays a finger of white caviar on top, which is quite readily rejuvenated."
"Pale orange/golden pour. Awesome nose -- mix of pine, orange, pineapple with a hint of funk that really works very nicely together. There is a ton going on with the taste -- pine, pineapple, with a strong (but not overwhelming) bitter hop finish. Nice smooth mouth feel. This is without a doubt a world-class DIPA - certainly one of the best I have had. I would stand in line in the cold for a case."
One of those beers that's pretty much worth the hype. Bottle into snifter. Gold in color. Slightly hazy. No lasting head. Moderate lacing. Immediate tropical fruit smell with some real dankness shining through. Similar flavors. Could drink this one all day if there wasn't a two case limit. Feel is perfect. Somehow light while packing oh so much flavor. Bottom line: you should drink this beer.
"I'm a little surprised by this beer, and not in a good way necessarily. It pours beautifully with a slightly hazy body that has a brassy orange glow. It draws a full, creamy white head that settles into a foamy sheet they leaves generous lacing. The aroma is very piney but with some citrus and tropical notes I even get a little bit of licorice. It's definitely big and complex but doesn't hit the notes I like. The taste truly follows the smell--even the hints of licorice. Again not my jam per se, but I totally get why people gush for this beer. The feel is a bit off for me. I love how there is a touch of sweetness that gets smoothed out by dryness, but I do think it's a touch too bitter. While it's not boozy, it's also not crushable, but it shouldn't be. Overall I think this is truly a world-class beer, it's just not really in my personal wheelhouse. I'm very glad I got to try it and I would definitely drink a lot more, but I don't think I'll be jumping in one of those epic lines anytime soon."
Fresh bottle drank on 7/3/2016
Not as good as lunch IMO :)
Absolutely beautiful and complex. Lives up to the hype!
"16.9 oz. bottle obtained 6/25/16, same date as on bottle, after waiting online for 3 hours and 45 minutes. Many waited longer, few shorter. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass."
"Delicious and rare. Low ABV double I PA. Citrus and fruit are obvious, but there is no unpleasant sweetness. Crisp and refreshing. I recommend having Dinner and then following up with a Thank You that MBC just released. Perfect back to back combo IMHO."
"An east coast answer to Pliny, but not as harsh. Super piney, better noise than lunch. Very easy to drink. Dangerous."
"I'm a fan of all of MBC's brews, and was lucky enough to try Dinner in a bottle in early April. It has a nice, slightly cloudy, copper color. Flavor balance is outstanding for a DIPA -- the hops are strong but do not mask the hints of citrus or malt/sweetness. Easily my favorite double IPA. I like it more than other top ranked doubles, probably because they have managed to not mask the more subtle flavors in the brew."
Hops are the key here. When fresh this is a stellar choice for the strait up hop fan. This and lunch are the best Maine brews I've had.
"Maybe I'm just biased, but this is pound-for-pound the best DIPA I've ever had. Dinner gets 5's across the board b/c it deserves it. The hop profile is ridiculous, creating one the most appealing aromas of any beer I've ever opened. The malt backbone perfectly compliments the hop additions (even after dry-hopping) which makes Dinner wicked smooth, bub! Great citrus taste w/ a smooth (almost creamy to me) mouth feel. There's a reason this beer sells out in hours every few months. Fantastic!"
Refreshing and delicious...unique flavor
I'm not usually an IPA fan but this one is actually quite good. It's much more palatable than anything I've had outside of treehouse or the like. Maine is doing very well with this one.
Love the cloudy New England style.
Notes from 4/9 while reviewing taxes.
IPA with out the tropical. Which is why I think this rates as high as its a different IPA (IMHO). Just a touch past golden in color. Would drink again (and then again).
White head. Lace. Golden yellow color.
"This beer was a real treat. Lots of sweet hop and citrus notes, very crisp for a DIPA, nice body and strong hops throughout. One of the greats."
A cloudy bright yellow. Big puffy white head that lasts forever. 
Love the taste of this beer. Doesn't have the smell or look of the other similar beers but the mouthfeel and taste is great. Want this one again. Glad I live in New England
500 ml bottle was poured into a Spiegelau glass. 
"This is a wonderful offering from MBC. While I'm not a huge fan of hype, it is real with this beer. It's hard to imagine this is their first double IPA. Smooth mouthfeel gives way to a very full flavor."
"Most likely the best beer I have ever had. Smell, look, taste just perfect."
"Lives up to the hype and then some. Beautiful, just the right balance of haze and depth of color. Smells of dry citrus peel, warm hay. Flavor is just a bouquet of hops, tinge of sweet malt and a booming dry finish that just cleans the palette. Ridiculous. You know a beer is great when you get a little sad. I can never have this beer for the first time again."
Amazing. That's the only word for it
"Beautiful hazy golden color with a nice foamy head that trails downward as it's consumed. Smells of citrus fruits and fresh hops, and taste follows. Good carbonation, nice feel, and great balance of fruit, malt, and hops. A really good DIPA, and I'm glad to have had the chance to taste it."
Excellent bottled beer....great taste....great feel
"Dinner! Wow, so long to find this. Well worth the wait. Bottled 3/26 and poured into a teku."
"card #311 an the 3/26 release. Worth the wait? Yes, but just once to have done it. Lives up to the hype? No."
16.9 oz bottle poured into nonic pint bottled on 3/26
"I am lucky enough to have tried Dinner bottled 3/26/16 and this beer stands in the pack as one of the best IPAs. It is turbid, medium tan wood floor color. Leaves substantial lacing around the glass. The hops are kept in a delicate balance coming front and center first, then hides with a sweeter, juicy clean middle, and then the grapefruit hop bitterness sustains even after you have finished. Layered and complex, but the crispness does not hide the alcohol as well as Tree House. I have no idea how this compares to previous batches, but Dinner is best served fresh. Cheers!"
Pours a hazy golden yellow. Aroma is tropical fruit and juicy citrus. Flavor is clean and juicy. Has a nice citrus aftertaste. Overall this is a really delicious IPA.
"So pumped to have finally tracked this down. pours hazy orange, aroma blasts you with grapefruit, pine, fresh peeled orange, and some pineapple. taste is like fresh carbonated grapefruit juice with a bit of sweetness but that similar bitter grapefruit finish. overall great beer don't know if i would wait 12 hours in line for it but i would certainly love to track down some more."
Bottled 2/18/17. Enjoyed 2/22/17 in a tulip. Acquired in a trade for Lambo Door/Bright.
Bottle dated 3/26 bought from the brewery release this morning. 
I really enjoyed this one. Got it in a trade.
"I like all the Maine beers, this beer was a bit hyped for me, I'd rather have a lunch than wait in line for hours but it is still a very good beer, had a bit of booziness to it, but it is a double. The hops didn't bite me as much as I like in a heady or sips. I'd still trade high for this beer though if I had to again."
"Bottle shared in London - many thanks to Paul. Pours unclear gold with a frothy white head. Great aroma, lots of peach and tangerine, slight pine, pale bread. Medium sweet flavor with rich citrusy fruits, papaya, melon, mango, light alcohol boost, light bitter grass, soft pale malts. Full bodied with fine to average carbonation. Resinous finish, lightly warming, with rich hop character, pale bread, buckets of citrus, more papaya and mango. Extremely soft and drinkable. Tremendous."
"Was excited to try this, typical aroma ,color ,look and feel of a northeast ipa. Taste was good but no where near what the hype was. A bit bitter on the back end. Floral and citrus up front. Solid but not worth giving up treehouse or hill"
Absolutely love this beer fresh. Falls out quite quick though...
"tried during last release, was a great standard ipa but i wouldn't go out of my way for it now that ive tried it."
Poured from a bottle courtesy of @buking21
"The only way this beer could get better is if the smell was a little stronger. Other than that, this is a phenomenal beer. Juicy yet dank. Very resinous mouth feel. A strong brew, one everyone should have on their short list of must have IPAs."
One of the best Maine IPAs
"Very unique. It has a really strong aroma of sweet tropical fruit, grain, and dank hops. The taste is almost like a pineapple pastry. It has a delightful soft bread flavor along with the tropical fruit, and hos with notes of honey and basil. The mouth feel is light, smooth, and very drinkable for 8.2%. If the fruit came through on the flavor a little more, this would be one of the best DIPAs I've had, but this bottle is almost 6 weeks old so I'll have to try a fresher bottle at some point."
10.24.15 release (late review)
"Oct. 2018 update (on tap): Nicely balanced between citrus, some pine, and clean malt. Honestly the best thing about this might be the aftertaste, if that is even a thing...similar to apple cider. Kind of a weird note perhaps but there you go."
Damn near perfection.
"All around excellent beer. The flavor profile was very reminiscent of Pliney the Elder to me which is obviously a good thing, but with a little more citrus flavor and a more delicate mouthfeel."
Bottles on 12/19 and poured into my hand blown savion glass
"Outstanding, I've had a plenty of DIPA brews, but this ones different. For starters it's all about the hops. To me, this is very hop forward with minimal malt backbone. Lots of Falconers and Citra hops make this citrusy and dry. Poors light clear yellow with very little head, smell is citrus, mouthfeel is thin, taste is citrus maybe dank, dry finish. Very interesting, wish this wasn't the only bottle I had."
"A must try for all beer drinkers. My only advise, dont drink it directly out of the fridge. Let it sit out for 5-10 mins and let it warm up a little, it'll allow you to get a better taste of the flavors."
"Finally got a case last Dec. It tastes smooth, floral, citrusy, and light bodied for an Imperial IPA. Its release is definitely something to get excited about."
The perfect beer
Week old bottle thanks to @DMBosox11. Thanks man! 
"Look: deep yellow, almost Amber. Slight haze; transparent on the edges but not in the center. Decent head that settled with very small bubbles."
"Best beer Ive EVER had, nuff said"
One of the best beers I've ever had. Was it's absolute best the day it was released.
Bottle dated 12/19/15. Enjoyed in a snifter on 12/27/15.
"This is the most flawless beer I've ever had. I don't see any single area that it's not perfect (from look to smell to taste). It's the optimal Double IPA. Anytime I'm able to get my hands on it, I love it!"
"I was #380 on 12/20/15. Well worth the wait. Dinner brings elegance to the palate. The aroma is entrenching and the flavor is exquisite. Citris, piney notes and hopped up with a smooth finish."
"Straw golden brew, with nice head and retention. Slightly hazy."
"500 ml bottle. Pours hazy orange with 2 finger white head that fades pretty quickly leaving coating lace. Nice citrus peel nose. Taste is a near perfect balance of sweet n bitter. Light cracker malt with dank citrus, pine and floral hops. The bitterness is soft and lingers just the right amount. Semi dry finish. Full soft creamy mouthfeel. I see what the hype is about. Not a juice bomb, not a hop bomb, just pure balanced delish. World class IPA."
"Tried this at the brewery last week in a flight after a few stouts and thought it was good, but did not get the hype. When I tried this with clean pallet, I realized this is truly an outstanding beer. Look: Pours a orange yellow color with minimal head. Smell was orange and grapefruit and some bread. Taste was understated and complex. Smooth flavors blending together with Orange giving way to a slight grapefruit pucker. Fell is excellent, but a bit syrupy. overall one of the best."
"wow! I have always been a huge fan of lunch and have been fortunate enough to have it w just 2 days post bottling...and I have had dinner, but this bottle...this bottle I am sipping now...bottled 4 days ago and is incredible. just lush and full with juicy citric flavor. this beer...this is a beer! thank you blessedbebeer!"
Had this with my Dad. Waited 3 hours in line to get. Cant wait to share with family.
"A friend of mine showed up with 3 of these the day they were ""born on"". I was excited and almost nervousness to try this overhyped beer. The color is an amazing orange. The head held strong. The flavor was layered with pine and citrus. Very interesting the whole way through. When they were done we switched to sip of sunshine, and it tasted one dimensional and flat. Dinner is as good as advertised. I didn't stand in line for this beer, but I would next time."
"First beer I've gone out of my way for a release and it was well worth it, definitely upcoming on the cult beer status. Just like most have said it pours a golden tangerine, smells of citrus and fruits, tastes that way as well great balance, smooth and delicate, and overall just a well done super easy refreshing drink."
"Excellent dipa, gift your palette."
"what a treat! looks way better then HT, Swish, etc. Aroma is where this wins over others IMO. Loads of citrus, tropical fruit, pine. moment it touches the tongue and palate, you get this amazing balance of waves of hop forward tangerine, green mango, pineapple and then the hop bitterness. long lasting dry finish. "
"Strong, yet not overpowering hops. Stood in line 3 hrs. Will do again"
"Into wide wine glass. Pours cloudy with little head. Chunky, yeasty, sweet aroma. Barleywine subtle flavor with a fuzzy mouthfeel and a sweet oats aftertaste. Taste that starts in the mouth and creeps to the palate and then the nose and saturates the senses. Overall excellent beer."
Top 5 beer hands down!
Delicious IIPA but not quite sure what all the fuss is about. There are literally dozens of beers equally as good or better and much easier to obtain. Glad I got to try it and would drink it again but certainly wouldn't trade or jump through hoops for it.
Incredible!
"An amazing beer but too much hype around it. If you make great beer, make it. Don't make people jump through hoops like its the beer they served at the last supper. Luckily got it in a trade because otherwise wouldn't make the extra effort to obtain it."
Pours orange with just a slight haze. Head is creamy and thick. The initial aroma is of dank and pine so I was expecting a heavy strong ale style. Instead on first sip it explodes into citrus. It's not juicy and not grapefruit-y but like lemon without too much bite. It is light in body and nicely balanced in bitterness.
L- Pours a hazy tangerine color with fluffy white head.
"Not even going to bother going into the categories, simply put this beer is on another plane of existence. Pours a light golden, hazy color. Smell... Good God, the smell... Hoppy, piney, fruity, dank. Taste is everything you want in a DIPA, literally everything, and is the reason why this beer is a perfect 5. I have always felt Maine Beer Co. excelled at producing a perfectly balanced IPA, and with the amount of flavors packed into this beer it is a minor miracle it still manages to stay perfectly balanced between every flavor, big or small, that it contains in it's luscious 16.9 fluid oz. If I haven't made it clear enough already, seek this beer out, buy it if you're in the are (of the brewery that is) and you will not be disappointed."
"This beer appeared very light in color, not what i expected from an IPA. Nose was not overwhelming, smelled fruity with a little pine. Very good but subtle, Taste was biggest surprise, juicy and barely any malt character. Nice and bitter, but washed clean off the palate.Profiled the hops and not the malt. Absolutely delicious beer, would say its the best DIPA i've ever had"
This is one of the top 5 IPA's I have tried. great stuff. Super well balanced and finished dry just how I like my IPA's. Thanks for hooking me up Keith!
"Very good, smooth tasting beer. Actually did a blind taste test w Dinner and Julius Both beers were liked but Julius was picked by all 4 of us. That shouldn't keep you from wanting this beer though, as it's still one of my favorites."
This is the perfect IIPA.
500 mL poured into an oversized tulip.
"Dinner was so good, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, from all the pre-hype."
Bottle dated 10/24/15 poured into a snifter.
"Purchase at the release on 10/24. Thought I already reviewed this but I guess it didn't post, so this is based on half a dozen bottles consumed since. I would so very happily drink this beer and no others for the rest of my life. "
"Bottled on 10/24/15; drank in a tulip glass on 11/7/15 thanks to my friend with ME connections; meets the hype, excellent inclusion into the New England IPA hall of fame"
Had it on draft PERFECT
"Bottled on 10/24/15, consumed on 11/08/15."
"Thank you Jason! bottled on a Saturday drank in WI on Wednesday. Pours a perfect head into my teku glass, almost a golden orange hazy appearance. Smell like a hop bomb/1, so many fruits coming forward. Taste reminded me of King Sue, perfect balance between tropical fruit, citrus and floral flavors. balanced bitter finish. It has a great mouth feel, overall its a fantastic beer, super well crafted with everything you want from a DIPA"
Had this one on draft at the brewery in Maine. No bottles were available or I would have bought a few.
"Pours a cloudy goldenrod and looks really juicy. Nose is full of pine, stone fruit, and sweet melons. The body is super easy drinking. You could drink this for days of not for the 8% ABV. Very well balanced in the taste with some juiciness followed by a light pine bitterness and a crisp lightly dry finish. This is an extremely well crafted beer."
"Hot on the heels of Lunch IPA, the Main Beer Company sees potential. Backed with the knowledge of what ""imperializing"" can do to hops, they get back to the drawing board and devise an ale that's sure to become the equivalent of catnip for hop-heads."
"L - opaque orange. Not terribly impressive, but no slouch either. EDIT: I rescind the previous sentence. Missed out on the yeast on the bottom. The final pour is gorgeous. Can't see through it. Haze and OJ. "
A: Pours a cloudy golden color with a beautiful one finger white head and just swathes of lace down the glass with each sip. A beer cannot look better than this. 
"pours a very hazy orange/yellow color. smell is mostly hops, with a slight sweetness: tropical, citrus, and other bright fruits. taste follows the smell, tropical fruit, citrus, pineapple, mangos, are the main taste, with sweet malt sneaking around at the end. big bright hop bomb. mouthfeel is good, very crisp refreshing and dry despite being a DIPA. I was hoping the taste would be a little more intense, but it's still extremely good and far better than most beers. good good beer, wish it came around more often and wasn't so damn hard to get ahold of."
"Almost a perfect DIPA. Hazy pale orange/yellow makes it look like mango juice concentrate. There's a huge amount of hops on the nose and taste, with tropical fruit and citrus notes throughout. Bitterness in the taste balancing the whole thing off. The mouthfeel is as smooth and creamy as I've ever had in an IPA - this beer is the ultimate iteration of a ""New England IPA""."
"This beer is the perfect ipa. I initially thought julius was better until I had this again tonight. Nose is perfect, piney and maybe some eucalyptus, which is very inviting. The flavor bursts of mango, pineapple, and some fresh pine. No one flavor dominates and I was surprised at how smooth this was for a double. One of the few beers that lives up to the hype and I will be trading for this again in the future."
"Overall possibly the best ""balance"" of any IPA I've had. Amazing nose with a crisp, peppery hop bite leading into a super creamy finish. Basically an amped up version of Heady, well done MBC!"
"Easily the best NE IPA that I've had to date. Juicy, juicy, juicy. Massive tropical fruits on the nose followed by a explosion of citrus/peach flavor. Definitely lives up to the hype, glad I got to try it less then a week old."
Thanks to Kenny for the hookup. Review from notes.
"Gorgeous beer. Delicious pine and resin scent and taste. Ultra fresh. Body and malt backing could be slightly greater but this is just a reviewer struggling to find fault. Competes with the best dIPAs -- Pliny, hop slam, dread naught, etc."
Bottled 10/24
Near perfect in every way. Smell is by far the best of any DIPA. You can smell it from 5 feet away. Tastes is a perfect balance of tropical/Citrus fruit and Hop bitterness. Delicious!
"One of the best beers I've ever had. Nose is outstanding, color is splendid. Taste other worldly. Amazing, amazing beer!"
Tremendous.
"Major thanks to Jared for this. From a bottle dated 102415 (2 days old). Pours cloudy orange with a puffy white head. Aroma is big sweet citrus. Taste is citrusy, but more bitter pine with a biscuity undertone. Mouthfeel is perfect, and leaves the tastebuds buzzing after each swallow. Finish is bitter and dry, with a faint lingering sweetness. Absolutely amazing."
"Attended the release yesterday (10/24/15) and purchased a case. I loved this beer the last time I had it, but now, after having it again from a different batch I think it is safe for me to say that this is hands down the best DIPA I have ever had. The aroma is absolutely insane. I could smell this all day without drinking it and be content. The taste lives up to the aroma too, which in many DIPA's I find not to be true. Perfect beer. Seek out, it is worth it!"
3 weeks old in an IPA last glass 
Bottled this morning (10/24/15) and hauled all the way back to Philly.
Pours an ever so slightly cloudy bright golden orange color with a large white head. Leaves a beautiful amount of lacing around the glass as the head dissipates. 
Golden cloudy color. Great smell! One of the best smelling beers I have ever had. Strong apricot and citrus notes. Similar notes on the nose with a piney hoppy finish. World class. On par with heady/sip and the like.
"Got this beer by chance from now a good friend. This is my first introduction into Maine beer and god damn is this beer phenomenal. Had this 4 days after the last release. This was a hyped beer I guess I missed. This beer in my opinion is what Pliny is supposed to taste like. This beer has tons of hop and fruit aroma, lots of pine as well. This is in my top 5 for DIPA's and its something everyone who likes beers should drink."
"An opaque gold/orange appearance. Aroma of biscuits, plum, citrus and tangerines. Tastes of biscuits, honey, oranges and tangerines for days. The particularly abundant tangerine and orangish malt flavors impart a world of soft rounded citrus flavors that taste out of this world. Bitterness seems mild and the alcohol is nowhere to be found. World class."
"When fresh this could have the juiciest nose of any beer I've ever had, just a phenom of a beer"
"One of the best East Coast DIPAs for sure! Pours an orangish color with small amount of head and solid carbonation. The first thing you notice on the nose and tongue is the Citra hops. Flat out amazing! Maine Beer Co nailed it on this one, cheers!"
This is one of the hyped beers that actually lives up to what people say about it. I was lucky enough to have this 2 weeks after bottling and it is wonderful. Lots of dank oniony notes and citrus on the palate and nose. Medium body and bitterness. Subtle malt that delicately balances the hop bomb. Just a touch of booze. One of the best beers I've ever had.
"After having lunch and being a little underwhelmed, I didn't have high hopes for dinner."
One of the best IPAs ive ever had
"There are so many other good IIPAs in New England these days, I just don't get the hype here. Yes, it is solid, but it doesn't come close to the mouthfeel or juiciness of Treehouse, Trillium, or any of the stuff from Vermont. Rock solid, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Had on tap. Wow! Just bursting with so much flavor from the hops. Lots of pine, orange, grapefruit, and some hop spiciness. Yet still very light on the palate. Orange haze on pour. Extremely balanced and flavorful, the hype is very real"
This is my favorite DIPA. So balanced it's scary. You would never know it comes with an ABV above 8%. Nice white head and lacing. Bitter but balanced. A must try.
"Smells a mango and a pineapple went at it and this is what ""came"" out of it (see what I did there?) Great nose, good body, nice bitterness, I don't find if as being as highly coveted as BA traders think. Good but not top 5 for my personal dbl ipa"
It smells actually like sex and pineapple. The scent of this is like nectar of the gods. Not the best double IPA I have ever had but this beer is the real deal.
Had a blind test with some heavy hitters....this was hands down the best iipa in every way. Will continue to trade for this one.
"We had this beer as part of a blind taste test and I was blown away. The beer poured a pale/straw yellow color and was rather cloudy. There was only a little head, but good retention. The taste was amazing; sweet, tropical and clean."
"Was fortunate to try this day one of the most recent release and several times over the past month and this is some serious sauce here. Deep tropical hop flavor balanced to absolute perfection with a clean, crisp malt profile with just a hint of sweetness. I've had beers from TH and Trillium that pack a bigger hop character but none are in suhc perfect harmony with everything else present in the beer."
Long-time whale slated. Amazing brew.
Wow! The first east coast DIPA I've had that truly blew me away. 
"By far one of the best smelling hoppy beers out there. Such a light but aggressive hop profile. Very fruity and floral. Taste is beyond definition, very clean tasting, easy drinkin that is not overly bitter or pine-y. Virtually no alcohol taste. Feel is light, crisp and dry. Outstanding like all of MBC's beers. One worth getting but you will wish you had a constant suply."
This shit's the bomb
Got a chance to try this over the weekend and it was absolutely AMAZING! I don't believe I've had a beer that smells so fantastic. The tastes backs up the amazing tropical fruity hoppy smell. Love it.
16.9 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Consumed a little over three weeks after bottling date.
"Pours light orange/straw with nice head and lacings, cloudy. I get aroma of tropical fruit but not as much as other IIPA, but aroma is maintained thru tasting. Taste is big fruit of mango apricot pineapple. Extremely smooth, almost sweet no lingering bitterness. Delicious beer but not as complex as my absolute favorites."
Move over HT. Dinner is my new fav. The hop aroma is intoxicating and the beer is smooth perfection.
"The Brewers say drink this beer, don't sit on it. I had my last one tonight. 16 days after I got it. Had a distinctive different taste. This was my first split case, I'll get it again, great double IPA."
"Another overrated beer. This beer is missing the aroma, however does drink incredibly well. Just don't get why people go nuts about it."
"Very similar to Lunch. A wonderful Hop bouquet. However, the body is much nicer than Lunch. It is a well-balanced IPA and a pleasure to drink. Plus, my wife loves it."
a - Cloudy and pale straw color. Thin head with good lacing.
truly exceptional brew; stands with the best DIPAs
"Very nice beer. Tropical on the nose, but I would not say it is fruit forward as I did not get the tropical taste until the end. Very nice beer."
huge thanks to gary for the freshie bottle (bottled 6/20 - 6 days ago). enjoyed from my mbc mini snifter.
Cloudy orange body with a froth of sticky yellowish head. 
16.9 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.
Got in line at 5am and it was well worth the wait. Strong citrus and pine smell begins the well balanced hoppy experience.
Tastes like a stronger Lunch with a little more hops.
From a recently purchased bottle.
"Pours a pale gold. Smells tropical. Mango, Clementine, lime. Tastes immediately like sweet citrus fruits but has a hoppier bitter backbone most doubles are missing. Really good. Bubbles dance on the tongue like light champagne."
I picked up a bottle of Dinner in a trade. 
A massive DIPA and in the top 5 all time for me..
"A: Cloudy, darkish shade of orange, with a foamy, white head."
"Thanks to freefs119 (Reddit) for this one, shared with rudzud."
Similar to Lunch but smoother. Probably the best beer I have ever had.
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
Bottle into snifter.
Best beer ever. Great taste
"Cloudy golden pour from the bottle, thin off-white head. Huge grapefruit and tropical mango aroma (fills the surrounding area). Lemon bitter, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, some malt sweetness but not sugary. Finish is a hint grassy but predominantly grapefruit and mango. Lives up to the hype."
The best beer I've had from Maine Beer Company. Super juicy with the perfect amount of bitterness to it. I will most likely drive up from PA next year to get a case of this!
"Tried this at the pre-share for Embrace the Funk Fest @ Yazoo. Very light in color, aroma was pleasant and the beer was super smooth. Enjoy most everything from MBC"
Appearance: Pours a hazy goldenstraw capped by an inch or so of foam; dribs and drabs of lacing hang around
"This one is a solid DIPA from the East Coast. Solid bittering, nice malt flavor, a lot like Heady Topper. Taste is way greater than the aroma. This one is definitely different than the tropical hob bomb of Lunch and focuses on the dank."
16 oz bottle (thanks Nathan!) poured into a Hopslam tulip glass
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. The smell wafts throughout the area as soon as the cap is popped. Huge hop aroma. Pours a cloudy, hazy orange color, sticky two finger head. Laces from start to finish. Taste is just perfect, so smooth it doesn't feel like a double IPA. I think this is my favorite of all of the NE IPA big boys - it's one that I feel like has out done its hype."
"Great, smooth beer, hard to believe it is DIPA"
L: Orangey-gold with a creamy bone head that disappeared into a collar. 
Poured from a bottle into a tulip 
Wow! All I can say is Wow! Pretty much lives up to the hype. Great Citrus Hop nose. The draw is liquid gold nectar of the gods! Very juicy almost Nelson like. Glad I got to try this. Great job MBC!
One of the best DIPAs I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Very refreshing with a lighter mouthfeel and cleaner taste than you would expect. Highly recommend.
Great IPA with an amazing citrusy aroma. Definitely better than both Pliney's. Haven't had heady yet.... will have to see how it stands up. Easily in my top 3 favorite IPAs.
Best DIPA I've ever had. Might be the best beer I've ever had.
"My little brother traded 2012 Parabola for this. Well I have to say, this is an excellent beer. Very nice for a double IPA and definitely a step above Pliny even on the freshest of days. This was bottled 12 days ago. Very delicate flavors. Great citrus profile. I put this right there with Bad Boy. Definitely in my top 3 favorite IPAs. Too bad the bottle is not a full 22 oz. Still, probably would have kept that Parabola... but that's just me."
"Way over rated, I traded for this. It came way hyped. "
One of the best IPAs out there. Finally got hold of a few and was blwn away. Super citusy and refershing.
Easily the best IPA I have ever experienced. Everything from the aroma to the flavor was perfect.
"This is a review of 7 bottles from the same case of beer. Bottom line was 4 bottles had great appearance but aroma and mouthfeel were light. Flavor profile: forward and middle were just ok before pulling a Houdini and completely disappearing on the back side. Totally disappointing especially because these were the first four bottles sampled. Score: 3.6. When the fifth bottle was sampled I expected more of the same but was in for a shock. This bottle had everything. Appearance, aroma, mouthfeel and flavor profile were excellent. This I believe is the Dinner that gets rave reviews. Score: 4.5. The remaining two bottles were good. Not as weak as the first four nor as strong as the fifth bottle. Score: 4.1. In my opinion there is a definite lack of consistency in this beer."
Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a goblet. Acquired in an IP trade with Mike - thank you very much!
Not my favorite. Wouldnt buy more. I thought it was mild all around.
"This is the best big IPA I've had, and big IPAs are my favorite beers, and it's my first rating... so 4.75 is the highwater mark for now."
"Aroma is amazing flood of tropical fruit - mango, pineapple. You just want to keep smelling it. Then you taste it. An explosion of taste matching the aroma. Excellent color and lacing. The bottle read do not age and I did not. This will be the benchmark for all future dipas for me. Thank you Maine!"
It doesn't get better than this in IPA land
16.9oz bottle shipped to Nebraska!
Hands down one of best beers out there. Crafted at a Hill Farmstead level and certainly surpasses Heady in all forms. Mouthfeel is incredible.
Liquid Juicy Fruit gum. A little thin for a DIPA but great sweet fruity hop flavor.
"Bottled 4-11-15 consumed 4-16-15. Very nice head with a slight lemon yellow tinge. Sticky lacing. Aroma has a good balance of pine, mango, pineapple, and a to ugh of bubble gum. Taste was slightly reminiscent of the aroma with a bit more of the pine than the fruit. Slight aftertaste of pine. Felt it was slightly thin for a DIPA. A very good beer but not in the top echelon of DIPA's."
Great DIPA might be the best I have ever had!!!
Takes the cake as the best beer I've ever had. I am sad to see how hard it is to get
fruity. amazing aroma. worth the praise.
10.24 batch. citra all in the nose.. some dankness as well.. look is classic hazy... taste is fantastic.. mouthfeel is awesome.. but wish it was a little creamery.. but thats knit picking.. unreal beer..
"Looks cloudy, golden, with noticeable carbonation. Smells sweet, hoppy, and fruity. Tastes clean, hoppy and bitter. Very well balanced. Carbonation is like a subtle seltzer. Amazingly delicious. A really well made double IPA. 'Lunch' is a favorite of mine, and this is a step above. It's hoppy, drinkable, and all the right things a Double IPA should be. With such limited released, I've heard this beer described as a ""myth""... but it's real and it's fantastic."
"An excellent DIPA, my favorite from MBC behind Mo and Peeper."
"Overall a very good DIPA, but in my opinion its just another very good DIPA. Very similar to a lot of things out there. I was hoping with my first taste It would give me a different opinion. Still think that initially Heady Topper, Focal Banger and SOS are bit above the rest for me in terms of flavor, balance and just better overall beers."
Great beer for sure. Similar to Tree House Curiosity 14 actually.
"Not overly hoppy, goes down smooth, and bursts with a crisp freshness"
Tasty. Great DIPA and certainly worth the wait in line.
"Worth an overnight in Freeport, ME"
Top 3 beer I've ever had. Helped that it was bottled on the same day I drank it
L: a lightly cloudy beer with a full head that lingers
"Waited four and a half hours on line for this beer, and I'm happy to report that it's magnificent. A gorgeous beer to look at: bright orange, hazy, fluffy white head. The nose and taste are superb: tropical fruits, grapefruit, dank, piney. It may be a while before I sacrifice another four hours of my life waiting for a case, but I'm so glad I waited all morning."
"Had a case of this last summer. I am seriously behind on rating beers, and need to catch up. I have no problem saying that it is one of the top 10 beers in the country right now. Everything from the taste, color, presentation, and smell knocks you off your feet. If you like PtE, you will love this."
Way behind on my entires. Had three 500 ml bottles around New Years all from the 12/8 bottling. Incredible Beer. More assertive flavor than the other MBCs I enjoy.
"So good! smooth taste and finish. dry hop smell. The big brother of ""lunch"" lived up to the hype that it got once it was released. Very very solid beer."
"I had just put the finishing touches in a 32 oz sucks when my pal called and asked if I wanted some Dinner. Point being my pallet was not clean which I normally require when rating a brew. That said, overall it's a Maine dipa. Fucking high end shit. Effortless enjoyment."
L: a beautiful orange hue with a white as can be head. 
Tap at brewery in december
Many thanks to Steve for providing the bottle!
Dinner was fantastic! Wish I had more!
Absolutely amazing. Best double IPA I ever had. We also did a blind taste test with heady and mastermind and stone enjoy by. This one came in first place accross almost all reviewers (6 out of 7 had Dinner first place). This one stands up to the hype.
"Liked the nose, but little to bitter for me."
The nose of this beer is truly unique and is definitive the highlight of this awesome DIPA.
"Amazing, so glad to finally try this very pungent IPA, delish!!"
Great hop aroma and flavor without being overly bitter or harsh. Great elements of citrus and tropical fruit. Great job Maine!
The beer comes in a dark peachy orange.
"Brewed December 6th, opened December 12th. Many thanks to costanzo_mike for the haul."
12/6 bottling. Beer was graciously sent to me by a good pal who knows I love nice things. Poured into a Lawson's tulip. 
"Look: Pours a beautiful bright orange, with thick white head. Nose: Dank, Citrus & Mango. Incredible nose on this beer. Taste: Tropical Fruit & Citrus, Dank Hops, bitter/Dry finish. Mouthfeel: Light, but creamy--coats the tongue--extremely pleasant."
"look- color is a bright orange, pours two fingers of white head, head settles into thick spots of lacing."
"Well=hopped, but balanced."
Bottle dated 12/6/14 (4 days old)
"Dear heavens to mergatroid, this beer is so delicious!"
"The nose was good. Thats about it. Reminds me of seltzer water. Light, watered down? Taste , where are the hops ? Tasted much more like a pale ale than a double IPA. Very let down."
Wow! Well done!
"Nice beer but not worthy of all the accolades. In my opinion, its a distant second to heady, Mettle and HF stuff."
"From a bottle born yesterday (yes, I was one of the crazy people there at 5 AM in the sleet) and chilled overnight (after a 650 mile drive home), poured into an Allagash tulip glass. "
"Made the trip to Maine to wait in line for a case of Dinner (and Lunch). Got in line at 6:20am and was #147. Maine Beer Co did a great job with the release - very orderly, kept everybody informed about their chances to get the beer, and the brewery smelled incredible! "
Amazingly smooth hoppy burst with smooth afterflavor. This is the best beer I have ever tasted!!!
"Obtained today at the brewery during their 4th release of Dinner. Poured out of the bottle into a white wine class - full golden color with a nice head. Fresh, fruity and hoppy on the nose. Taste is a subtle, composed combination of tart fruit taste and moderate hoppiness. Less abrasive than Heady Topper, but full of taste. Super awesome!!!"
"Pours a hazy golden/light orange color with a significant head that lingers some. Also some lacing on the glass. Smell is piny, tropical, dank, hoppy. Taste is full of piny, butter hops. Alcohol is well-hidden. Very smooth mouthfeel, extremely easy drinking. World-class beer right here"
"Froth for days. Spongy cloud that laces everything it touches. A pale burnt orange. Translucent more than cloudy. Like smelling a pine tree forest on citrus fire. Grapefruit, orange, peel. Let's get tropical. The first taste is an assertive wet hop. There's that pine and peel. Medium high carbonation. Noticeable ester oils. Super smooth."
"Beautiful hop aroma upon opening. Jam packed with glorious hop flavor while still being bright, citrusy and not too bitter. I love the carbonation Maine Beer achieves in all its beers - tiny bubbles that surround your tongue and seem to press the flavor into your taste buds! Minimal alcohol flavor makes this beer dangerous! One of my all-time favorites!"
One of the best beers you will find in the world when available!
"500ml bottle, dated 7/28/2014, poured into a Lawson's snifter 10/2/2014. The guy who sent this to me assures me that it hasn't dropped off much, if any, from fresh, but we'll all be the judge of that."
"A good IPA and the best Maine has done. The hops are tasty up front with little bitterness on the back end. It drinks easy, this beer can quickly disappear on you."
5/5
"Pours a hazy medium amber with a thick pale white head which dissipates quickly into a thin foamy cap with light lacing. Lots of citrus, mainly grapefruit, and pine resin on the nose with hints of sweet malt and tropical fruit. Bitter on the palate with gobs of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit with a hint of orange zest. Pine resin on the finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation with a crisp, dry bitter finish. Overall an outstanding DIPA that can stand with the best of them! Great work Maine!"

"A: Golden, Hazy, Cloudy, Single-Finger Head w/good retention and lacing, medium-medium high carbonation."
Great batches of Dinner truly rival Double Sunshine as one of the tastiest DIPA's on the market. 
"Had this at a bottle share, great west coast dankness, piney, tropical fruit, nice color, and so damn smooth. Really enjoyed this"
"7/31 bottling, consumed 8/13. Legit. By far the best beer I've had from MBC."
Thanks to Wowcoolman for sharing this one at his tasting.
About 3 weeks old (sacrilege I know...)
Bottled 07/31/14. Tulip glass.
"Slightly hazy, golden orange color. Fresh to death. Papaya, mango, pineapple, grapefruit juice and pith. Cracker malt. Hefty bitterness, yet it's not overwhelming. Dank. Dry, medium finish. Clean. Real good."
"A - pours a very hazed golden straw color with more than a finger of bright, near white head, strong retention and perfect lacing. Perfect, 5"
Bottle opened on 6.18.14
500 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
"This poured out as a slightly hazed orange color with a thin white head. The smell is loaded with Fruity hops, really nice aromas coming off of this! The taste is great as well, just crushes your tastebuds with hops. Overall this beer is fantastic and hope to have it again someday."
"Perfectly fine, but extremely overrated. Lunch and Another One are far better."
"My good friend brought over a bottle of Dinner to share, and I'm SO GLAD he did. This is an unbelievably good beer. The bottle was dated 7/31/14, so about a week old. "
"The beer pours a gorgeous, golden, orange, settling into the glass with a creamy, off-white head of minuscule bubbles that lasts at a fingers width above the beer. The head leaves sticky fat fluff of lacing when it rescinds. In body, the beer is a nearly opaque murk of tiny particulates and haze. On the nose is where this beer is king. From the moment you pop the bottle you know you are in for a tropical fruit bomb. Even from a foot away, my glass is oozing fruit salad scent across the nose, but when I get my nostrils nicely in the glass’s bulb, I’m met with decadent and complex hop aromas. Pine resin blends with pineapple, mango, soft melon, and fruity caramel. Alcohol does prickle at the edges of the nose, but only if you search for it, and as a whole the nose just comes off smelling like a hugely aromatic fruit salad with accents of pine. This has got one damn fine nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet up front, but with definite bitter balance that builds into the middle and finish of the beer wonderfully. Booze makes its presence known towards the finish of the sip, punching through some of the decadent hop notes while acidity is faintly present on the fringes of the tongue. In flavor the beer begins as pineapple juice, moving more towards pine with flashes of medicinal hops, bright grass, lemon citrus, and grapefruit juice. Slight alcohol and caramel hops enter in the middle of the sip, but the finish of the beer is straight ruby red grapefruit juice with just a hint of booze. The aftertaste is of piney/grapefruity hops. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to full bodied, with a middling carb that provides a healthy scrub to the tongue. Mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent, if a touch heavy towards the finish of the sip. Overall, this is a hell of a Double IPA. I’ve already heard it compared to the Headys and Plinys of the world (gasp…) but I think that was a forgone conclusion. MBC makes some damn fine hoppy beer and this is no exception. This beer strikes towards the top of the DIPA list for sure, and is a true work of art in terms of juicy, tropical fruit hops. I do have some quibbles with it, however, as I do with any beers. For starters, I think the booze could be a little better integrated, as it does add a bit too much heat towards the back of the sip. I also feel that the nose far outweighs the taste in terms of overall decadence and hop character, which can be argued as an attribute of DIPA’s, but since we are talking God-Tier DIPA’s I must say that others of this plateau have met that balance more so than Dinner. The nose is where Dinner is a winner, for sure, and she is a damn fine winner. Drink the beer fresh. Enjoy it. Wait in line for three hours if you want to. It’s a nice beer."
"Heady Topper! Please move out the way I'm about to have some ""Dinner""... Whoa!!! This beer is right up there among the great beers in the country.. This beer the second I drank it, I knew it was up there with the best.. Cheers to this beer.. If you live near Maine or even remotely close.. Better get this beer... Unbelievable..."
HUGE thanks to Bill for this...
A: cloudy yellow with the slightest orange tint. Nice foamy head that sits atop the beer for a while and provides decent lacing.
Dated 7/31 picked up at the brewery release - we got there late to avoid the lines expecting just to try on draft and lucked into the end of the 4 bottles per person distribution. 
"Look : Pours a deeper orange, not too much carbonation, i would say a little less than usual"
"Drank on-tap at The Thirsty Pig, Portland, ME"
I was fortunate enough to be present for the second release of Dinner at the brewery. I tried it on tap and then purchased 3 cases.
L - Lighter side of orange. Hazy. two fingers of white head.
"Reviewing Dinner, an imperial IPA from Maine Beer Company out of Freeport, Maine."
Appearance is a hazy orange with a half finger of white head.
Poured into a snifter.
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tulip
A: hazy orange and a creamy white head with slightly larger than average bubbles
"Great beer. Huge floral notes, highlighted by ripe grapefruit and cantaloupe. "
"gugs killed me softly with his song, telling my whole life, with his song, "
Was fortunate to get a few bottles after the release on 5/21.
Bottle opened by stillmatic2232 at his bottle share.
My big thanks to BigStein88 for this bottle trade!
Beer pours a hazy golden orange with frothy cap with subsides afyer a minute or two.
"Bottle shared by MrBarleywine, huge thanks Mike!"
A-Dinner time. Pours a hazy orange with yellow hues that emanate from its center. A strong swirl of my glass only aids the beer's pillowy head. The head settles down noticeably as a thin blanket of white fuzz. Lacing is quite sporadic.
The aroma alone puts this brew into another realm. Seriously I could inhale the intoxicating scent for days on end. You add in the beautiful hazy orange color and that fluffy white head and you almost have the perfect hoppy beer. To make that perfect brew you include the insanely balanced flavor of hops/malt/citrus/bitterness/juiciness.
Probably my favorite beer.
"Trip to the brewery today for the Dinner release, bottled yesterday :-)"
"Was lucky enough to grab a bottle of this a few weeks back before the, what seemed to be a limited release batch, ran out."
"Dinner pours a hazy honey amber with a small, creamy head. The foam lingers on top leaving a netted pattern of lace as it fades."
"I wish I could rate this beer a six. My 2nd favorite beer all time. Not so much the tropical or citrus hops that are working here, but more floral hops. Somehow, though, this beer is not overly bitter. Not sure where the 8% is."
"Not a huge fan of going agressive with 5s but I think this one deserves a spot alongside the greats and is probably my most favorite from mbc. Dinner, mo, lunch another one on the IPA/apa side."
Had on tap and in bottle. Only advice with bottle would be to makes sure you don't pour the sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Bitters the beer significantly. 
"Picked up 4 bottles at the brewery today, same day as release, all bottles were dated 3/11/14. I also had a glass on tap while i was there. Super hazy copper color with a thick bright white head. Smells like a bouquet of fruits, melon, grapefruit, citrus. It does have a faint dirty feet stank if you huff on it enough, not complaining it smells great overall. Tastes like it smells, super fruity. Reminds me less of ""Lunch"" and more of ""Another One"". Seems to be a cranked up version of ""Another One"" and as much as i love this beer, I think I'd rather have it in it's single form. Overall, this is fantastic and i'm glad i drove 3 hours for four bottles, amazing beer. Cheers."
"On tap at the brewery. Have been to MBC a few times, and this was the busiest and for good reason. Dinner is the real deal. Everything you like from Lunch and other MBC ales - fresh, innovative, equisitely crafted - just a lot more of it...and yet the barrel aged king Titus porter was maybe the best beer on tap."
"Picked up on 3-11 at the brewery. Drank that same night, bottle dated 3-11. Amazing. It's a great looking beer. Orange/yellow/pink, murky, decent head and lacing. Really, I just like the color. Wow, the aroma is incredible. It's so juicy. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, some pine and you can definitely detect a strong bitter citrus rind. The bitter citrus is the most dominate feature here. The taste is very bitter up front, with notes of citrus, and a piney aftertaste. Also a bitter pineapple juice flavor. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, med carbonation. Huge dry hop taste lingers for a while. Definitely one of my favorite bitter DIPA's. There is a little bit of alcohol burn on the end, but it's well hidden, as it's mixed in with all that bittery goodness. Really hope they make this again. Definitely don't mind the brewery only aspect if I can pick this up on same day bottling, either."
Picked up four bottles at the release and enjoyed it on draft at the brewery along with the Barrel Aged King Titus. Both were mindblowers.
"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro."
"02/2014 - Huge grapefruit, some caramel, orange rind on the nose; great bitterness, floral, strong punch of pine, orange rind, and grapefruit; superb body that blows many stouts out of the water; the finish is dry, bitter, yet flavorful and balanced!"
"After a hard day working, this is an amazing treat! Everyone knows how good this stuff is, and I’m equally impressed as everyone! One of HF’s best!"
This beer is absolutely amazing. So refined compared to a lot of dipas. 
Had on tap and brought two 750ml growlers home. 
It's been awhile since I've had this one but I remember a hazy and enjoyable IPA from the NE. I don't think it was as fresh as I would have liked it but I was in Texas and can't complain.
"Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew, again."
"I had this one a few months ago on a month old growler and wasn't impressed. Decided to just rate now having it fresh. Same balance I get, nothing too tropical, not too citrusy, slight bitter finish. Loved it."
"Finally got a chance to try this beer. I've had lots of other HF IPA's, but this one has escaped me, until now."
Elderberry? Oustanding beer. Finish that leaves you begging for more. One of my favorite beers.
"Very cloudy with a brownish gold color. It looks like apricot juice except for the head, which is solid and lasting. Extensive spots and a few streaks for lace. "
"Poured from growler and consumed alongside barbecue salmon dinner. Cloudy pale orange color with a soft and frosty head that leaves a coating on the glass. Hoppy aromas including tropical and resin. Taste is delicious as expected with long lasting hops and a fair bit of bitterness on the finish. Mouth is just about right. Overall, a classic NE IPA."
"Poured from a 32oz growler into a tulip glass, one week after purchase. Appearance is hazy orange/brown and opaque with 2 finger thick head. Smell is a nice mixture of earthy hops and citrus (orange) with notes of honeysuckle, a touch of burnt sugar, and hay. I'm not surprised it is made with American hops. "
Thought it tasted a LOT like Double Citra.
One of the best HF beers I've had
Look: golden orangish yellow with an inch creamy head
750ml swing top growler filled on 8/30 best by Sept 6th poured into a shaker pint.
A - Pours a very hazy orange with a white head and lots of lacing
Draught. Fantastic. Deceptively light.
Absolutely love this beer.
Light amber/bark straw very cloudy appearance with significant white head that disipates slowly. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus with a tough of hops. Taste is also a mild citrus that is very pleasant.
"Growler from Hill Farm, brought back to home, drank the next day. "
"On tap at Positive Pie, Montpelier, Vermont."
"I am not sure if it was the journey taken to get this growler at the Farmstead that is driving this score, but it does feel good to enjoy the fruits of my labor given such a long trip to get to the farm. in any event, this was a solid offering. subtle fruity notes on the finish of this DIPA. feel was a little on the flat side, but it was poured yesterday, so perhaps that has something to do with it. Treehouse still rules the NE IPA scene in my book, but this put up a solid showing."
Small pour
"For me, Hill Farmstead beers are few and far between, and each is proceeded by massive notoriety and a reputation for excellence. This plays itself out in one predominant way - extremely high expectations due to the hype and the sheer number of excellent beers that I consume between sessions. I must've had dozens of great, outstanding and world class beers since my last HF beer. All that being said...this is fucking incredible. "
Thank you jhavs for this
"Had on tap at draft house in staten island. This was pure and simple magnificent. Maybe the best beer I have ever had....definitely the best Hill beer and I have had many of their best. The mouthfeel was wxceptional with tastes bouncing around and popping out as it coats your tongue with citrus, hops, a bit of creamyness and a bit of sweetness. Glorious!!!"
Everything about this beer stands out but the mouthfeel in particular is the best I've encountered in an IPA. So soft and smooth it's unbelievable. Big citrusy hop flavors with surprisingly little bitter bite.
This beer had a more orange coloring with a slight creamy head. Notes of citrus are heavy in this beer and has a strong hoppy flavor that doesn't overpower all the other flavors
"Look: Hazy, yellow, turbid."
On tap at arsmby abbey poured into a stemmed goblet
Enjoyed this amazing DIPA at Armsby Abby today.
Thanks To Dylan at the Henry Street Taproom for a very generous share on this one.
Growler was filled yesterday at the source.
"Growler. Drank 10-20-16. Classic, but new school too. Delicious."
Currently #25 on the Top 250 beers list. I found it on-draught at Threes Brewing for $9 per small pour. Billed as an imperial IPA in spite of its scant 8% ABV.
"The beer looks beautiful. Rich, thick, cream colored head that stays. It's got great retention. The body is a hazy golden yellow. It's looks very enticing. "
"not as aromatic as Id expected and definitely not a juice bomb. although I do love a huge nose, I drink for the taste, not the smell. definitely a lot going on with this one - hugely weedy, pine, earthy dankness, orange, grapefruit, floral notes, grassy herbaceousness, bready malts. lots of stuff coming together super clean, classic HF mouthfeel seals the deal."
Since first having Hill Farmstead I have been on a mission to find Abner and I have finally found it!
"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 11/02/16. Served in a spiegelau."
On tap at As Is. 
"From growlers purchased at HF 6 days prior, poured in a shaker pint. Sampled S&S #4, Susan, and Abner before purchasing anything, then got growlers of the latter two. Expected to like Susan best (and it's great), but preferred Abner on site and then when drinking both head to head at home. As for Abner: delicious beer with no flaws."
"Yields a completely hazed yellow-golden mango pulp color with a fluffy, stable white head."
Visited the Hill Farmstead Brewery today and picked up a growler.
On tap at Whetstone Station
"Cloudy, yellow and lemony. Slightly see through when you hold it to the light. Topped with 3 fingers of lemon tinged, foamy white head. Amazingly fluffy lacing."
"Filled while at HF into 750 growler, opened 2 days later. Kept cold the since growler was filled."
"Grabbed a 350mlm growler at the brewery. Ended up waiting almost 10 days before popping the top. A great blend of pine/citrus/and resin. This was a nice change from the ""juice bombs"" everyone is brewing now. Look is a nice light orange with moderate haze, leaving lines the glass. HF just nails the body and mouthfeel. For a highly hopped 8.2% DIPA this beer comes off as almost delicate. Such an incredibly balanced beer. Malt flavor is just strong enough to provide backbone for all the hops. So smooth and easy to drink. Amazing execution of this style."
Poured from a growler into a tulip. Very smooth tasting double IPA with no alcohol presence. Well balanced citrus and pine flavors but by no means a standout IMO.
"750 growler filled two days ago. Light carbonation, light hazy. Has apricot flavor, smooth, juice like. Excellent beer. I wish I could get cans of this or lived closer."
Sooo oh Sooo good
"I believe any of the given options at Hill Farmstead are excellent choices. Abner, Insergency stick out as superior choices."
"Caveat - this is my first Hill Farmstead and drinking after a marathon, so very possible Schlitz would get a world-class rating right now."
"Another great double IPA from Hill Farmstead. very good, wish he would bottle some IPA's because these are great. Tasted smooth and light for a double. Highly recommended."
Tried it in 2015 when they were still doing flights. I remember it being the dankest of the IPAs i tried that day
"Darker and clearer than I expected, but still knocks you off your chair. This is an intense brew with all of the qualities that you want and seek out."
Look: Dark orange. Slightly hazy. Low carb; little head retention.
"Finally got to try my white whale ipa, and it was well worth it . Paired with some hot chicken at Hattie bs and good friends. Perfect example of what a hoppy beer should and can be ."
"This one combines bitter grapefruit, soft peach, and earthy hops. Also has lemon and tangerine. Its sweet with pine notes, but its not too thick or syrupy. Mouth feel is medium and crisp. Its very refreshing. Glad I got to try this."
"Growler filled at the brewery and consumed a few hours later. Hazy orange, cloudy, good head. Aroma is citrus and pine, lots of hops. Flavor is the same and the mouthfeel is interesting. Overall a tasty DIPA and the alcohol is quite well hidden."
Look - Signature HF look. Hazed. An awesome looking DIPA. 
On tap at District Social
"Very good but def not my fav offering from Hill Farmstead. Very good taste and doesn't drink like a imperial double, very smooth but I was a little let down."
Poured on tap at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock Vermont into their snifter glasses. 12oz pour.
"Someone brought a growler over for a bottle share. I guess it is slightly old for a growler, going on 5 days. Still was great. Poured a hazy orangish straw color. Nice pine citrus aroma. Taste was slightly sweet, but finish very citrusy and pine. Nice smooth mouthfeel."
Drank on tap at The Well in Brooklyn. 
"Sent to me by vtambrose, tag says best by 12/1/2015, consumed 12/8/2015"
"Tasting notes from November 11th, 2015"
this was an amazing Double IPA... it has great color too it- the smell is tropical and citrus.. the taste is so clean. I love a little bit more huge hop presence for me.. but if you like smooth this is it... awesome beer
Had this one on tap at Armsby Abbey
"simply put, a delicious iipa. a HF classic."
"Well, this one was tough to track down. Twice while in VT I just missed getting some. Then one of my fave brew pubs down here had it on tap but again I missed out by hours. I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. 2 more swings n misses before I finally got to try this fine brew yesterday and it did not disappoint. Another fine IPA out of VT. Nice golden color - not mush of an aroma but what was there was pleasant. The taste was exactly what I expected, nice hop hit and super smooth with tons of flavor. Well worth the effort. Cheers"
750ml growler bottled two days ago.
Up there with Dinner! A top double IPA without question!
"This is about as great an imperial IPA as I have experienced. Perfect in almost every way. Filled 10/17, drank 10/24, poured into snifter. Solid head that laces well, big juicy nose, and the taste is out of this world. One of the best beers I have ever had."
"Pours a beautiful unfiltered bold orange with a full two finger head. Great lacing and retention. Smells of fresh citrus, slightly dank, some earthy notes and pine. Taste is overwhelmingly flavorful with mango, orange, pineapple. Plenty of hops and bitterness on the back end, but it's superbly balanced so not one single great flavor stands out much more than the other. If anything, a slight nod to the citrus. Drank from a growler filled the same day, Abner is incredibly smooth and creamy. I expected big things from this beer given it's notoriety, but this is undoubtedly the best Hill Farmstead beer I've ever had. It may be the best beer I've ever had."
"Description: Golden color and clear as could be with a white head and lacing. Aroma or citrus, mandarin orange, apple, floral, maybe a bit of pine and something a little earthy. Fruit and apple come through on the taste and bitterness is just enough. The beer is extremely well balanced and leaves a very clean, dry aftertaste that slowly dissipates off the tongue. For an IPA, it's a very full-bodied, 'meaty' beer if not quite velvety."
"Out of s growler from the Hill and poured into a snifter. Nice clear orange hue with a small white frothy head. Smell is very fruity and floral. Ripe peaches, guava, and other citrus really jump out. Taste follows the nose, super smooth with no bite whatsoever. Overall a delicious and delightful IPA. I've yet to be dissapoited by anything from HF."
L: Hazy orange and honeycomb hues with a healthy white head; incredible lacing
BEST BY 9/23 Growler. Past it's prime.
Growler poured into a snifter.
I tried this from the growler chilled in a Hill Farmstead Goblet shared with abru17
"Poured from a 750mL growler into a tulip glass. Best by October 1, 2015 date so I'm a day late. "
L: Hazy with a light orange glow. Soft billowy white head--similar to most HF ales.
"Poured from a 1.5L growler into a HF stem glass. Shared with my hophead wife. Thanks to @Evilash for grabbing this for me over the weekend. Poured darker than I expected. Was expecting a cloudy haze of a beer in the grand NE tradition, but this beer bucks tradition in every way. Huge citrus on the nose, floral in taste, and that clean HF finish. There is a slight booze burn, but it adds depth to the beer. All in all, a wonderful experience- right there with the other VT IPAs and perhaps exceeding them."
HILL FARMSTEAD ABNER DIPA 9/23/15
"Had this straight from the Hill Farmstead tap and man was it delicious! Orange/amber color, (amazing) mango/citrus smell, slightly boozy and overall just awesome beer. I could throw a few of these back for sure! If you can, definitely make the trip to the brewery in VT as it will be a memorable one. Cheers!"
"Tons of herbal funk that I'm reluctant to call dank - it's most underbrush on a wet spring day, it's broken fir boughs after a storm, wildflowers and warm grasses - coupled with some citrus and mango notes. But it's that field aroma that makes it for me. Mouth is chewy yet finishes crisp."
"L: Opaque, light orange. Not much head, though significant lacing"
"On tap at the Blind Tiger Ale House 8/18/15. It was piney and floral, slightly sweet with a bitter finish. Very unique tasting, kind of an east coast exploration of a west coast IPA. Like no other DIPA I've tried. Impressive."
"L: Hazy orange. Small white head lasts and lasts, lots of lacing"
"What is this wizardry?! This is one of the most interesting IIPA's I've had. While it is not my favorite, the experience of this beer is singular and well worth the legwork to get it. This is way more than a tick on the top 250, this is something special."
"Inch tall fluffy bone white head, orange body. Clumpy lacing. Lovely."
"Was finally able to try one of my white whales....this beer has eluded me at every turn for the last 18 months...every time it released I tried multiple times to get it and was not able to....FINALLY landed a 64 oz growler and drank it with a friend, poured into a tulip and right away you notice a really nice orange hue in the beer which is cool. As you drink there is tons of lacing present on the glass. Nice well balanced citrus hops character and smell. Overall an amazing beer!"
"Pours a hazy golden yellow/orange. Aroma of dank hops and biscuits. Mouthfeel perfect; crisp and refreshing. Taste is piney hops with a wonderful malt backing -- present but not overly cloying. It's certainly not the most bitter or hoppy-tasting DIPA, but its impeccable balance puts Abner up there with the best."
L: a bright golden yellow haze with a slight white head. 
"Amazing stuff! Lovely hazy gold with a perfect head. An array of grapefruit, tangerine and other citrus notes. Clean, sweet-ish finish. Quite possibly my favorite of those legendary Vermonters."
"Citrus nose, sweet finish, no bitterness. Surprisingly thin. Quaffable, but there are many better. Was expecting more."
Worth the effort to find and enjoy
"Poured on tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, Mass"
"On-tap 8/1/2015 at Armsby Abbey, in Worcester, MA served in a tulip glass."
1 inch thick foam head. Fantastic lacing. Cloudy gold color. Nice fruity aroma. Every Whig has a different layer of citrus. Absolutely delicious. Nice citrus balanced with a piney bitterness. Feel can't be any better for an ipa. Easy money 5. Incredible beer.
"This is close to as good as it gets. Pours a hazy light orange color. Thick fluffy head and great lacing on the glass. Smell is fantastic, tropical, hoppy. Juicy taste, with some sweetness. Hops shine through beautifully. Feel is extremely smooth, goes down very easy. A favorite of mine for sure"
"Abner is a journey of hops. Over its course, it shows you everything a hop can do in a beer. It's bitter, it's sweet, it's piney, it's juicy. It compliments the malt and at the same time forsakes it. It is a beginning, a middle, and an end playing out on an earthy stage. Fantastic."
"Had this on tap on 7/27/15 at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT."
"Growler filled on 7/22/15 at Hill Farmstead Brewery; drank in a tumbler glass on 7/25/15; my growler was labeled as an ""Imperial Pale Ale"", which is not technically the same as a Double IPA (or is it?). I went to the Hill Farmstead website and confirmed:"
"I am usually not one to subscribe to all the hype; however, I must say that Abner is worth all of the praise. This was hands-down the best DIPA I have ever tasted. Perfect in every way."
On tap at bluebird Beautiful !
"A solid rival for Headytopper, strong hops, notes of canibus. Nice orange-red color."
mouthfeel was out of this world. Pillowy and full of flavor in a way I didn't expect in a DIPA but that made this incredibly drinkable and enjoyable.
As close to perfect as it gets.
Huge juicy aroma. Initial passion fruit sweetness followed by bitter grapefruit. Smooth pine finish.
Me and a frind of mine travelled up to Hill Farmsread Brewery from MA. Awesome beer. Everything about it. Awesome. What more can I say about Abner than WOW!!!
"I had this and Society and Solitude #4 on draft and cannot see where the high ratings come from. It is a solid unfiltered looking VT beer, but does not compare to Heady or Second Fiddle IMO."
"Poured from a growler that was 3-4 weeks old. Light in color, great hop aroma, and the flavors that came through were incredible. Lots of citrus and floral notes and a very balanced flavor profile."
From a 750 ml growler
"L - dehydrated pee, super cloudy dark golden hues"
"Incredible beer, and my first from Hill Farmstead (non-collab). The citrus fruits are amazing - kind of like you're drinking the best glass of juice ever. Feels thick. Hops not overpowering. Must find more!"
"My favorite beer to date. Opague amber orange, nice lacing but the difference maker with Abner is the nose. Holy shit! Huge mango nose and pretty much any other citrus and tropical fruit you can think of. Smell is beyond a 5. Taste follows and although slightly boozy at the finish it's still absolutely crushable. I can't get enough of this beer when I'm in VT and my mornings suffer as a result. I can go on and on about Abner but you'll just have to try it yourself. If you are heading up to VT with the highest expectations and you fear that as a result Abner may be a slight letdown what will likely happen is it will be better than you could've imagined. It's that good."
"Right now... would rank as my favorite... but when ranking ""feel""... accessibility is a big thing for me. When leaving the brewery... and not knowing when I'll get to try this brew again... left me feeling a bit empty. It is everything it is said to be... simply awesome. Having to hunt this stuff down for one glass... keeps me from ranking this a 5 across the board. This is a beer that should be #1... but will never be... because it won't reach enough mouths to experience such a piece of beauty in a beer. The fact that it is a 12 here... is only data... purely data."
Oh Abner -- one of my all-time all-time favorites. Gorgeous golden color with just a bit of charming haze. Big hop aroma sings a prelude to the piney citrusy love affair that follows to the tongue. Everything about this beer flirts with blissful perfection.
Appearance: love the haziness of this beer. Orange-ish color.
Rating from a draft I had on tap at the Mad Taco on 1/31/15. It's up there. All these Vermont Double IPAs is like arguing between being dropped in a shark tank with a cut open or left in a hungry grizzly beer cage wrapped in fish.
"Look: A beautiful cloudy orange body that you cannot see through. The head is a white broken, irregular film that gathers halo style around the glass. White clingy legs. "
A M A Z I N G
"Growler, pours is cloudy orange, aroma is awesome citrus and grassy pine. Taste is perfectly balanced and a dry finish. excellent beer"
"This IS the best Vermont IPA, slightly edging out Lawson's Double Sunshine but certainly better than Heady Topper."
This ais a complex and seemingly overdone concoction that comes out AMAZING...
Look- Cloudy yellow like a Stoner's urine on random drug test day at the office.
My favorite DIPA out there.
Wow had it on 2 occasions OMG GREAT
Simply one of the best.
"Abner is my favorite hoppy beer from Hill Farmstead. Somehow, it manages to surpass the considerable hype. Although this one is on fairly regularly at the brewery, it is worth planning your trip to Hill Farmstead around its availability."
Poured from growler into tulip--thanks again @hopsynonomous!
"Phenominal Taste, Full body, balanced hops and malts make this one of the best Doupl IPAs ive ever had, better than heady topper for me."
Granny Smith Apple and dank on the nose. Taste is a hoppy apple jolly rancher and is awesomely smooth. Mouthfeel is smooth yet somehow syrupy all in one. Another great HF offering.
Full flavour and still subtle at the same time.
First impressions; very good hopp notes and clean finish. I would love to enjoy this again an again it was that good!
"solid beer, but very overrated!!! Awesome Brewery though a lot of good stuff out of here, i like a lot of their other beer more then Abner."
Amazing. This beer is in my top 5 IPAs and will most certainly hold on as it was delicious. I can't wait to go to Hill next year. I hope to meet as many deceased family members reincarnated into mouth candy as possible. Keep up the awesome work Shaun!!
Perfect beer. It had everything.
Smell and taste of intense citrus. Hints of pine and orange zest who bring a spicy aroma.
"From growler 1 day old. Beautiful color like all HF beers I have seen. Very approachable for a DIPA, we had 2 non DIPA loving guests over to try who actually enjoyed it. Very well integrated hops and long finish. I would feel comfortable serving this to relative newbies"
"This double India pale ale is fruity, hoppy and clean. Pours a hazy orange, and is the perfect example of the New England style India pale ale... Hill farmstead had another great beer here."
"Poured from growler into a hill farmstead tulip. A couldy yellow colour with a really nice head retention and lacing, silky white head. "

Nov 2014. Special thanks to Rachel for the haul.
"On tap at Beachwood Brewing in Long Beach, CA."
Where do I begin about this beer. Enjoyed from the brewery in Greensboro. 
Superbly balanced with an excellent blend of citrus and earthy hops. As with most elite IPAs....you enjoy it more and more with each sip and nothing takes a dominant role and the complexity unravels over time. Another fine drinking experience. Hill Farmstead has a collection of beers that will rival anyone in the world.
"WOW, what a great double IPA. Goes down great without any bitter overly hoppy aftertaste. Great aroma and smell and fresh citrusy taste. Possibly the best beer I've ever had."
"Best beer I every had. This means something since I had some amazing beers, like Heady Topper, Mastermind, Bourbon Stout from Goose before they were bought out..etc. The piney and citrus flavors linger on your taste buds like a fine wine. The complexity of the flavors is perfect. It takes me 4.5 hours one-way to get to their brewery. Well worth the travels!!"
"I've never had a beer before that claimed it was so high in IBU, but so delicate on the palate. "
"About as great as a beer can be. DIPA isn't even my favorite style, but I'd drink this all the time if I could."
Meh. I'm not really sure what the hype is about.
"Abner is an incredible DIPA. I wish it were easier to get, but as it is, I feel blessed to have had 2 growlers full (2L & 750). They're doing a lot of things very right at Hill Farmstead."
Served out of a freshly filled (9/20/14) Hill Farmstead 750ml growler and into a HF stemmed glass.
Very happy to have a chance to try this finally. 
Swing top bottle provided by maltzilla. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Fruity/citrusy hop aromas. Really tasty with pleasant citrusy hop flavors supported by a sturdy caramel malt backbone...
"Poured from a 750 ml growler into a hill farmstead stemmed glass. Best by 9/19, purchased 3 days ago at the brewery!"
"Growler filled at brewery on 9/10, poured into HF tulip glass on 9/13."
Appearance: It has a beautiful deep hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down slowly and leaves nice lacing.
Everything I have tried from this brewery has been mind blowing. Keep em coming Shaun
"Poured out of a 750ml growler into a tulip glass. I seriously want to thank one fellow bottle share local who brought this and several other HF beers out to the Bay. It really was a one of a kind, special event."
"Appearance- Hazy yellow, medium head with good lacing."
From a refillable bottle gotten at the brewery today. 
"My brother in law got this in a trade. It was fun to try something that we normally can't get in Wisconsin. This beer was very crisp and hoppy and all around, a very superb DIPA."
"A: Golden, hazy, single finger white head, medium carbonation, beautiful lacing."
"Poured from a 750 mL growler at the Toppling Goliath taproom at the King Sue release. Really clean and bright yellow body. Huge green nose with spruce tips, grapefruit rind, and almost a dankness/ditchweed character. The beer has just enough sweetness and drinks like liquid hops. Minimal bitterness cold, while there's a bitter kick at the end as it gets closer to room temperature. Absolutely world class. The body is so clean, and the mouthfeel is so smooth. Nicely carb so it doesn't come across as sticky."
"This beer is exquisite, the hop flavors are so powerful yet blended and refined. It develops over the minutes that it spends in the glass. More flavors come out as I drink it. Definitely an IPA experience like none I've had before. I can't really think of any that are better than this right now"
Sampled from a 750ml flip top bottle with a best by date of 8/21/14. Thanks to Clint for sharing!
A very hazy orange with a glow at the center like the sun. White foam rose and fell quickly.
"Hands down, 1 of my favorite IPA's."
One of the best DIPA's out there.
Growler filled 8/8/14 and poured into Belgian ale glass same day.
This is a absolute gem of a beer. Hits right off with a great citrus burst followed by a slight pine taste. Hard for me to rate against other dipas but its in the conversation as the best dipa out there. Great carbonation and a fantastic smell. They should make women's perfume that smells like this.
Poured from HF growler 
"Had this on-tap at The Reservoir in Waterbury. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Shaun Hill's arrogance, I have to admit this brew is pretty legit."
"Pours a cloudy yellow. Sunshine or lemon yellow with an orange blush on it. A fat head of creamy white foam adorns this beer and it looks striking. It has a beautiful tempting nose. Succulent hops, their citrusy fruitiness and some spice. A bit of soft sweetness for malt. It's the fruit peel that comes forward first and then as it drinks, some tangier tropical flavors. Dry biscuit malt that's a touch earthy and a lovely and balanced hop bitter finishes this one with grace and poise. A floral that comes to to the nose subtly and translates into the drink almost unnoticed except for it's lightness , it's flower petal backnotes. Dry with a crisp middle this drinks heavenly. It has stature and a tallness in the glass. It 's the way that the flavors come together with the spice creeping up on you until it ends with a slight flourish. It's the way the malt is softly sweet but not too sweet and how the fruit character seems to soar. It's the balance in the drink and in the end and that the bitterness is complimentary not dominating. "
"Beautiful beer: 1 finger Snow White head with good retention and tons of lacing; opaque, pulpy light orange and yellow brew."
"Got this today at Hill Farmstead. Why wait another day to drink it, right? Fresh as can be! Poured beautifully into a 12oz water glass. Didn't have proper glassware due to the fact that I'm taking a short vacation in VT (I'm drinking this at a Holiday Inn Express). The body is hazy and amber orange. Two fingers of fluffy white head."
"Had on tap at the Prohibition Pig, served in a 13-oz tulip glass"
Poured from a 750ml growler gifted to me in a beer trade into a Reidel Cabernet glass
Thanks to Steve for hooking me up with a 2L growler of this.
"Poured from a growler, fresh from the brewery into a modified tulip glass."
A: hazy and yellow hue. Dense foamy head that linger for awhile.
"Orange amber pour with a nice khaki head that sticks and laces fine. Nice hop aroma, not overwhelmingly bitter, but nicely present and complex - citrus, layers of tropical fruit, pineapple, guava, a bit of dank pine and resin, and just hints of pale malts in there. Great flavor as well, balanced hop bitterness, not too much, moreso packed with hop flavor, more citrus, tropical fruits, etc. Hints of pale malts just present and doughy enough to balance it out."
750 ml poured into Spiegelau. 
"L: A super hazy gold, almost looks like fruit juice, with a creamy white head and excellent lacing."
"Very hazy and dark gold in colour, almost a little orange like an apricot."
Amazing beer! This beer pours from a swingtop bottle with a cloudy gold/oragne color. Aromas consist of grapefruit hops and malts. This beer follows suit with taste and have pear hints. The aftertaste is a little bitter with hints of hops. Great IPA!
A - cloudy pale golden in color like a hazy sun on a hot day. 3 fingers worth of pearly white foam bubbles up quickly.
A: A hazy yellow body with a thick pure white head.
"From Hill Farmstead's website: ""Abner (1867-1953) is our great grandfather; Hill Farmstead Brewery rests upon the land that was once home to him and his fourteen children. In his honor, this double pale ale is dutifully crafted from American malted barley, a plethora of American hops, our ale yeast and water from Abner’s well. It is unfiltered and double dry hopped. Aromatic and flowery, bursting with notes of citrus and pine, this is the ale that I dream to have shared with Abner. 8%, 18.5º P, 170 Theoretical ibus. Ingredients: Pale and Caramel Malt; Dextrose; Centennial, Chinook, Columbus, Simcoe, and Warrior hops; Ale Yeast, and our Well Water."""
"The shade of amber/orange is stunning and one of a few fives I've given for any characteristic of a beer. Plenty of awesome citrus and sweetish cereal grains in the nose (I'm thinking Oats), and even more in the taste. Truly amazing beer!"
This beer comes in a bright hazy lemon yellow.
"Pour is a hazy golden yellow with tons of tight white head. Nose is huge, tons of bitter grapefruit with notes of pine and hop resin. Taste is more balanced, notes of grain and some underlying sweet malt. Extremely clean with no sugars, tons of hop punch. Strong grapefruit and pine with a touch of resin. Bitterness is present but well integrated through the soft well carbonated finish. Body is delicate and light. Great stuff."
A: Very hazy and yellow/orange in color. Great two finger foamy head that continues to linger for awhile.
Fresh from the brewery.
"This beer is actually great, almost under rated."
"Thanks to Dr. Chris for getting me this special treat. Like many have been a huge IPA head for a long time, but have found this one to be elusive. Won't waste time with redundancy. Beer has been well described without yet another blow by blow from me. Having said that glass I drank had a wonderful fresh orange nose and taste. One that was not so much one of many characteristics of the beer... as it was a real definer and distinguisher from other IPAs that are more lemon/orange or grapefruit forward."
"a demonstration in the art of dry hopping, this beer is a genius, and in some ways represents the final evolution of ipa, i mean, what more could we want in the style than abler, its the pinnacle for me. fresh growler filled at the source over the weekend, about as fresh as possible in denver. a wonderful pale hazy honey color, delicate and soapy white head over an inch tall fades very slowly. the nose is the best part of this beer, so hoppy, so fresh, so minimally bitter. its the best part of hops, the citrusy bursting ripe freshness, tropical fruits, its like fresh squeezed pineapple juice blended into a really awesome ipa, thats what it smells like, and its mouthwatering. the taste is a little less fruity and a little more to the point, which is a hoppy point, a long finishing refreshing juicy hoppy flavor, not oily and resinous like its west coast brethren, but soft and calculated. there is an understanding here of the art of brewing and of the use of hops that i have not seen equalled. the growler is not the most friendly format to the beer, its best right from the tap, but this is an ipa like none other. just carbonated enough, and very light for its strength. the grain gives the hops just enough to lean on without interfering. tangerine and lemon come into play, but no acidity at all. the finish is mouthwatering again, i just can't get enough of this stuff. every bit as good as pliny or heady or whatever else people clamor on about as the best india pales out there. this is the one for me. the only thing i would change is availability."
Finally had a chance to have this beer in Vermont.. Great beer nice smooth American IPA.. Smooth is how I can describe it.. Hops are just right in this beer.. If I had to compare a beer to this beer it would be LUNCH and MO...cheers to this beer..Hill Farmstead produces great beer and I look forward on having others
"Schnikies!!! Had no idea what I was walking into here, but SHAZAM! was I pleasantly impressed. Poured from tap into a tulip glass at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont. Deep orange/amber color and expected cloudiness. On the nose, the scent of citrus pine was easily overwhelmed by grapefruit/orange scents. On the palate, hops assert and the malts were nicely subdued. On the palate, the theme repeats itself, with a nice, clean hoppy burn on the end. The mouthfeel is more than drenching full/substantial. I think I like this well-crafted monster (dare I say it) better than the infamous Heady Topper of similar profile. All in all, a remarkably fabulous experience!"
Served from a 750ml growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip.
Like this as much as HT and more than PtE. 
My first Hill Farmstead offering. Shared a 750 ml growler filled 1/17; enjoyed 1/22. Served in white wine glass.
"A-Deep cloudy bright yellow orange, two finger head with nice carbonation with great lacing."
"Look: cloudy light orange, white long lasting head, with some lacing"
"A- Pours a hazy golden straw color with half a finger+ of near white head. Good retention, great lacing."
"Freshly filled growler at Hill Farmstead, enjoyed that evening in a snifter glass."
"Growler is a week old. Just got returned to me from a damaged package. Didn't want to send it again as a two week old growler. Looks like the shipping hasn't affected it. Pours a murky yellow/orange. Small head but great lacing left on the glass. The smell isn't overwhelming but it's very pleasant. Citrus is dominant. The taste is very well balanced. The citrus and grass/pine mesh well and nothing specific stands out. There is a nice slight bitterness, and it's not too sweet. Carbonation has held well. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and spot on, like most HF ipas. This has to be my favorite HF beer, if not my favorite of all time. It's so easy to drink with so much flavor. Abv is hidden very well."
Served in a Citizen Cider snifter from a 2L growler obtained same-day in Greensboro.
"Wonderful pale gold color with white head. Aroma is of freshly cut hay, honey, and a slight piney-ness to it as well. Taste is much more piney than the aroma. I also get some of the honey flavor; presumably from a light malt. The color also hints that they used lighter malts. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but I did enjoy the hop 'sting' on the tongue. Overall a great DIPA; I haven't been disappointed by Hill Farmstead yet, and doubt I will be any time soon."
A - yellow orange and clear. 
Fresh growler poured into HF tulip.
"75cl growler generously shared by Doug today, 9/6/2013. Poured into a Bell's snifter. Review #196."
"A - Yellow-orange, no head. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?"
"a: poured from a 750 mL growler purchased at brewery, 2 days later, into branded wine style glasses, the beer is thoroughly hazed thanks to its unfiltered nature, a deep honey amber in color, producing a full head that retains well"
How does a growler-only beer with a super narrow range of distribution have over 800 reviews in just over three years? What's happened?

Hill Farmstead Abner
"This brew was poured from a refillable 750mL Hill Farmstead bottle, filled at the brewery growler-style, into our Founders snifters. It glows a coppery golden orange, putting up a two finger head of creamy off white bubbles. This shows nice retention, leaving thick honeycombed lacing around our glasses. A definite haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The nose is richly citric and resiny of hops, with pale and lightly metallic toast of grain, fresh apricot, pineapple, and nectarine fruitiness, and a floral honeysuckle air blowing across the top of it. With warmth the aromatics really start to flourish, giving enhanced hoppy bite and sweetness of grapefruity, floral, and softly earthy varietals, mineral-laden well water, mud, black pepper booziness, muscat grapes, graham cracker breadiness, fresh mint leaf, blackboard chalk, and fresh peppery vegetals. Our first impression is that the flavoring gives extraordinarily juicy and fruity hops, but with nice balancing bite from the harder water and zing of grain. As we sip, the taste begins with a strong interplay between starkly, but authentically, sweet nectarine, tangerine, and pineapple syrups, and the dominant power of grapefruit rind, hop, and stem. These are met and balanced by a menagerie of raw honey, white grape sweetness, sulfuric mineral, lemon rind, herbal and earthy leafiness, cooling vanillas, lactic creaminess, metallic yeast juiciness, and solidly pale grain. The middle comes to a peak with lemon and grapefruity hops, herbal and spicy malt undertones, ethanol, gravel, mineral water hardness, mango fruitiness, and floral clover sugars. The finish is awash with pale graininess, effectively cutting the hoppy onslaught, along with newspaper inkiness, bright yeastiness, chalk and graphite, shitake meatiness, mango, strawberry, and pineapple fruitiness, and sweet booziness, with more of an herbal hoppiness shining through the ashes of the former grapefruit gods. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of grapefruity rind, seed, and juice, sweetly of nectarine and white sugars, pale grain, ghostly wheat, gravel, distant bubblegum esters, planty sap and resins, bittering moss and musk, light amber maltiness, and sea saltiness. The body is medium to full, and carbonation is medium to high. Each sip gives beautifully soft and creamy slurp, smack, froth, and glug. Finishing pop is nice and long. The mouth is left cooled and wetly coated, with eventually mild tannic astringency across the palate, and moderately robust pucker. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks incredibly well."
On-tap at the Prohibition Pig.
Teku glass.
"There's only so many words that can capture beers as good as this, let alone with the likes of What Is Enlightenment, Legitimacy and Heady Topper. Blasts of unfathomable citrus, the taste goes on and on and on. These here Hill offerings are the best of the best, hands down - the end of the line."

"750mL growler filled at the brewery on 6/5/13 and poured into a HF snifter just now, 6/8."
poured into a stemmed HF glass
"Cloudy pale orage color with decent white head that laces a bit. Aroma on this thing is killer! Smelled it once and started giggling it made me so happy, orange and ruby red grapefruit juice with hints of pine. Flavorwise, it's everything the nose leads with plus an added strong earthy hop punch. The earthiness starts to come out in the nose at it warms as well. It can be described as a bit garlicy. I get a bit of that sauteed onion and garlic with fresh herbs type of impression right after the initial citrus juice impression, but it fades on the finish. Super smooth bitterness here, very drinkable 8% IPA!"
Abner - 750 ml swing-top growler filled at HF two days ago. Poured in to my Hill Farmstead custom made glass. Got this on my trip up to Vermont to sample the wonderful beer that has come out of Vermont's booming beer scene. 
Poured from a 2L growler into a tulip glass
Big thanks to Franklinn for this one. 
"Beer pours hazy golden with about a finger of head that leaves an awesome lacing. I don't know if it's the hype, or if this beer really is that beautiful, but it's something to behold. "
"750ml Growler with swing cap filled late in the day on 05/15/13. Immediately stored in fridge and after 10 days still tastes great with good carbonation levels,(still had a small CO2 cloud upon release.) Served cold into a over-sized wine glass."
"Appearance: The cloudy honey-colored liquid pours out of the growler, generating an impressive head; terrific stickage with shards of lace poking up from the foam"

Hill Farmstead Brewery - Abner - On-tap
On tap at Blackback in Waterbury. From notes.
Screw a traditional review. This is not a traditional beer.
I picked up a growler of Abner on the way up to Jay Peak.
"Pours a beautiful bright orange with thin white head. Strong aroma of citrus fruit with sweet floral notes and a slight yeasty quality. Flavor of white grapefruit, grass and mango. Wonderfully medium bodied with light carbonation. Very fine bubbles give it a smooth mouthfeel leading to a crisp finish. Lingering bitter aftertaste. No doubt a world class beer."
"I had before, but had to go and get my own. I had from a 750ml growler, wish I got the larger one!"
750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
"A -- Poured from a growler. Hazy, thick orange beer with substantial head and moderate lacing."
"Transported back to Chicago in a 750ml Growler, poured into a HF glass."
Half growler procured from the source. Poured into my Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass the next day.
"Straight up im a sucker for that insane doub smell and the abner delivers a smell thats right up there withe the best DIPAs. Hops for days hits you in the face and it hurts so good. I think of this as a perfect mix between Lawsons doub sunshine (more tropical) and Heady Topper (more citrus). I found a perfect mix between citrus and tropical fruit, however that hoppyness took the cake. I pick up on some more earthy resinous tastes that I quire enjoy, but not as much as some DIPAs- well ballanced I was fortunate to drink it fresh as hell so the carbonation was on point. One of the best HFs I have tried so far and not too far removed from the Society & Solitude #6 but on a differnt level- whatever there so damn good its hard to go wrong with an HF"
"I was lucky enough to try this on tap in Waterbury, VT tonight. Pours a hazy orange color, with a thick creamy head. Smell is excellent; very hoppy, tending more towards the citrusy side, but it's complex. Tastes very much like the smell. It's full of hops, but well balanced with a bit of malt. It's not overly bitter, but not even close to sweet. Mouthfeel is outstanding; Full, with real body, perfectly carbonated. Overall, this beer is all about balance. It's not quite perfect, but the balance of all the factors is pretty damn amazing. Easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had."
You had this beer. 
Poured from a HF growler into a Founders Snifter. Thanks to mightyatom for the hookup.
Growler filled 2 days ago after a visit to the brewery.
This poured out as a nice hazy looking yellowish orange color with a big foamy white head on top. The Lacing was sticky and the rentention was very good as well. The smell of the beer has a large amount of floral and fruity hope aromas. The taste has a nice sharp pine flavor in there that is surprisingly balanced with the malt base. The mouthfeel is lighter and very drinkable. The carbonation was good also. Overall it's a great brew. Definitely something I could see drinking again in the future.
"Growler courtesy of a friend. I owe him big! Poured into some Hill Farmstead Stemware. This beer has a nice murky orange hue. There is a slight head to the pour and some minimal lacing. The smell is of sweet and bitter citrus. The taste starts off with some swwet hoppiness, think orange and pineapple and finishes up with some bitter lemon zest that lingers nicely. You want to repeat this all day! The carbonation is spot on and this beer is easily drinkable. Happy to have tried this!"
"Had this at the ""Prohibition Pig"" in the wonderful Waterbury, VT. This beer was delicious and definitely on par with the Heady Topper although quite different tasting. The Edward is one of my favorite beers and this tastes almost identical to me only with more body and higher ABV. The aroma was out of this world with lots of pine and citrus. Remarkable smooth and the perfect pairing with the 12 hour smoked brisket and bacon BBQ sauce."

"Had multiples on draft at Frida's in Stowe, VT while enjoying some excellent authentic Mexican."
Outstanding beverage. Smells of faint peach and apricot hit the nostrils from the hope varieties I assume. Gorgeous cloudy pale orange that looks like an autumn sunrise and has an ultra smooth mouthfeel that is creamy and just gorgeous. Yet another great offering from HF.

"Growler courtesy of ygtbsm94. Pours a clear light orange with a thin, white head that leaves no lace. Aroma is dank fresh hop, bright citrus, passionfruit. Taste is dry overall with massive resinous hops. Really insanely hop-forward and lacking complexity. 6/7/2010 8/3/7/4/14=3.6"

Poured on tap at the brewery into a Hill Farmstead wine taster glass.
Huge thanks to Jon for this!
Thanks to jaasen64 for the growler!
"A good big hoppiness. Foamy head on orange body, lacey. Fuller mouthfeel A wild yeast aroma, and some hops there in the smell. The second glass made the difference (and was a cleaner glass). Good mouthfeel for a DIPA. Citrus hoppy orange.On tap at the Prohibition Pig."
"Thanks go to Jonathan for picking these up from the source less than a week ago and sharing with me. Growler into a snifter, the brew appears a clouded golden orange color. A rich silky froth of off-white to yellowish stained head sits atop with decent powers of retention. As the cap fades, it leaves a webbing pattern of lace sticking all over the glass. A light swirl effortlessly revives the cap back to just shy of a finger's strength."
"From the source, 1 week old. Looks like other Hill hoppy beers I've had. Opaque, sort of orangeish deep honey. One finger white head. Not much if any lacing. The aroma is so complex. Pine, citrus, dank wet hops, almost earthy dirty grit. Very green hop aroma. Pretty insanely complex flavour to match the complex aroma. Citrusy, pithy, and well yes bitter. Abner is a little dank. The biggening is all hops, then you get some malty quality. There is certainly a little crystal malt in here adding a hint of sweetness to balance the hop assault. On my palate this beer is full, juicy from the hops, and well rather good. Could be a hint more dry. Overall this is a tad sweet for me, but that is the only thing I could possible say to take away from how awesome this beer is. Balance, huge hops, great balance, top notch."
"1 liter growler into Duvel tulip. Filled 7/28/12, drank and reviewed 8/1/12 (not the whole thing)."
"A-hazy golden orange coloring, 1 finger white head sticks around with great retention. Great looking Imperial IPA."
Fills the glass with a nice hazy peach color and crowned by a bright white head. Wonderfully aromatic with a big whiff of citrusy hop goodness right up front. Tropical and floral with little room left for malt aromas to come through.

"On tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington, enjoyed back to back with Lawson’s Double Sunshine. Geez there are some phenomenal hoppy beers coming out of Vermont these days. While I may have preferred the Lawson’s by a small margin, this is as good as the style gets; it’s simply a matter of hop profile and overall taste you prefer or are in the mood for at any particular moment. It would be hard to say Pliny or Heady Topper or Abrasive are better; just a bit different."
"Poured from 1.5L swingtop growler (less than 5 day old) into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to a fellow BeerAdvocate for going to the HF release party to pick up a growler for me. Pours hazy gold with a thin white head that lasts very nicely throughout. Wow! The aroma reminds me of the Ephraim, I pick up some mango, tangerine, pineapple, and some grass. The flavor sure reminds me of the Ephraim as the aroma clearly suggested at the beginning. Sweet pines, some lemon, mango, and pineapple are detected across the tongue as well. Thin and smooth mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. This is a very dangerously drinkable DIPA from Hill Farmstead. Glad to have tried this one out!"
Reviewed from notes - on-tap at the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier in late February.

"Enjoyed from a growler picked up at the brewery last Saturday. I've had Abner a few times, but this week it really stood out as one of my all time favorite DIPA's."
"Straight pour from 2L growler to Hill Farmstead large glassware (the oversized wine glass). No dating obviously, but that’s just fine—bought it at the brewery this past Wednesday, so three days ago. "

"Growler shared during Churchill's Renaissance at Churchill's Pub & Grille in San Marcos, CA."
Big thanks to Mike (gushue3) for the growler and other Vermont goodness. 750 ml swing top served in a CBS snifter.
Had multiple places in Montpelier. And have had it in multiple growlers. I'd bathe in this beer.
even with a week-old growler fill a nicely-sized pure white head raises from the cloudy golden/straw colored beer. it slowly recedes and leaves chunks and chunks of lacing behind.
"Matthew, I can not thank you enough for this. Not only do you drive all the way to HFS to get me a growler of this, but you also bring it to within 10 miles of my apartment. Thank you."
Review #150! 
Presentation: 750 mL growler fresh from the tap. Sampled on 2-19 after getting filled the day before at the Damon and Mimosa release. Kept chilled into the refrigerator unti opening. Poured into a pint glass and enjoyed.
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, thanks Satchboogie for bringing this back from the event yesterday. Pours very murky orange yellow, with a sticky one inch white head, a nice ring of lace. Smell is citrus heaven, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, grass, and tangerine. Taste wow, this is a Vermont style DIPA. All those flavors in the nose, more pungent then you expect, with smack of grapefruit mixed in the finish. Body is on the large side, enough carbonation, lush not dry, and crazy drinkable. Closest beer I have had with this taste is Heady Topper and I will have a side by side soon. This is possibly the best I have had."
I was lucky enough to pick up a small growler of this at Hill Farmstead’s Harvest Festival Event.
Draft serving into a 9oz snifter for $6.25. Sampled 2/1/11.

A - hazy orange with a 2 finger white head
"Reviewed from notes. Shared a 750ml swing-top growler with some friends this weekend. It poured somewhat hazy with a nice looking light orange color to it. It had a thin, white, bubbly head to it that mostly stuck to the edges of the glass. "
"Hill Farmstead Abner, on tap at Armsby Abbey in Woosta, Mass"
Poured into a snifter. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for this.
Tap at Armsby Abbey
Enjoyed on tap at the Armsby Abbey. My goodness.
A- Cloudy and hazy with a golden brown color to it. A one finger head that leaves great lacing down the sides of the glass. Beautiful.
"Fresh from the keg @ Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro VT (Harvest Festival)."
"This beer pours a straw yellow color with a little bit of haziness to it, there is a nice white head. the smell id citrus and piney hops and a hint of bready malt. the flavor follows suit with a mango of grapefruit flavor and a nice bitter piney hop finish , nice and dry. . overall this is a damn fine beer.the mouthfeel is dry and well carbed light body"

At the Blackback Pub in Waterbury. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
"Had this on 2011-10-15 at Capone's in Norristown, PA at a Hill Farmstead event. Had this again on 2012-06-09 at Teresa's Next Door and again on 2013-07-04 at TJ's in Paoli, PA."
"750ml growler thanks to Rschaeffer. I had some growler issues, so I will take that into account when reviewing."
So interesting. Received both Abner and Ephraim in a recent trade with mtardiff. (Thanks Marc!)
"750 growler into my fave snifter, i can already smell it..."
"Pours a hazed golden amber color with orange highlights, big cap of white froth and good sticky lacing. Scent is a wonderful blend of citrus and tropical fruit... orange, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, faint notes of light bready malt. Taste leads with sharp bitterness before it becomes all about the fruit, crockery malt makes an appearance at the end before the bitterness returns. Medium bodied, smooth, dry. Great fruit forward dIPA with one of the best noses around."
Fresh 750ml. growler sent the same day of filling by baconsausage. Thanks for the opportunity.

MANY THANKS to millerbuffoon for getting this growler through a trade!!!
"Had on tap at Blue Dog Chalfont's Wealth of Riches event. Poured on tap into large tulip. Beautiful foam crown. Great piney, citrusy nose. What a fabulous smelling beer. My favorite IPA to date, this has he most wonderful floral, grapefruit, piney taste. The mouthfeel is sublime. If you could only swish and spit your beer, this is the one. Fortunately you can swallow. GREAT beer."
"I had this on tap at the Hill Farmstead First Anniversary party, and then several times in growlers afterward. This is a nice DIPA, I actually preferred it to the Double Citra."
"On tap @ HF anniversary. Hazy orangey gold pour with white head. Juicy hop aroma, very potent aromas of centennial along with a whole variety of other stuff I imagine. Taste is hoppy, with a light honey twist. Very refreshing palate, dry but not abusively so. EVery good IIPA"
"On tap at the Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT. Served into a Hill Farmstead snifter."
"On tap at The Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT. 10-12 oz. pour into a Hill Farmstead longstem snifter. Cloudy pale gold color, and the beer was very cold. Head faded quickly but decent lacing. Nose is tropical/citrus with very little bitterness. At first sight and smell, I am curious as to how old this keg is. The last time I was in this establishment was late April, when I tried HF Double Galaxy. I have to say the Abner was delicious but not as impressive overall as the Double Galaxy. I am still very impressed by Hill Farmstead; I just think this keg was a bit aged and muted for a highly rated DIPA."
White frothy head on top of a caramel body.
"Having had this many times in the last year on tap and from the growler, I figured I'd finally give it a review."

"What a pleasant suprise from jammalamma, who just kind of sent me this growler. Really appreciate it, Ben! It was filled on May 28th so it was around 9 days old. Really, really cool looking growler, too. Split last night with the La Crosse crew after a great day of mountain biking."
Super cool 750 ml growler. Served in pint glass. 
64oz growler filled last weekend at the brewery's anniversary. Thanks to Sean (drazzamatazz) for the hook-up. Poured into a Maine Beer Company glass
"Tasted side by side with the double citra at Capone's, I thought this beer a tad less impressive than that great beer. Regardless, this is another fine IPA from a brewer who is clearly a master at crafting delicious IPA's."
"Pored into my pint glass. Golden honey color with three full fingers of foam head. Lacing is evident. Big citrus fruit on the nose. Carbonation is light to medium. Very light hop bite. Taste lots of grapefruit for me. I won't say I was underwhelmed by this, but I will say this was my least favorite beer I've tried from Hill Farmstead. Good beer, but not stunning."
"750 mL growler from HF, served in a nonic."
"the quality of a pliny on the east coast... crisp and complex with a broad not syrupy grain note. pour is golden with a white head. nose is a fruit and cannabis, apple, passionfruit and honey notes. palate is citrus complex sugars of fruit with a brisk ender and a hint of earthy bitterness. this is a summer DIPA that could be had in the middle of a hot day and would leave one feeling lethargic. this is sort of impossible... with that said. a total success."
"750ml growler from the source, filled 3 days ago."
Theduderules was nice enough to share this fresh growler with the gang.
Appearance: Beautiful cloudy orange-amber-apricot pour with great looking lacing.
"orange colored (slightly cloudy) with weak white head. strong hoppy notes in the smell, more with citrus than anything else with hints of fruit. Light and refreshing taste. grapefruit undertones and more tropical fruit in the background. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Alcohol is nonexistent. Very nice DIPA."
Am I drinking Pliny? I had one fresh lady night and seriously I cannot tell the difference.
Picked up during the Hill Farmstead Winter Gathering on February 12. Tried it on tap but didn't wanna review any 4oz samples. Hops fill the room upon opening.
Thanks to cbutova for sharing this beastly growler.
A - honey/cider like appearance with a very exuberant white head that leaves an impressive amount of lacing. 
My main man from Philly procured me a growler of this fine brew because I'm pretty sure he has a man crush on me. This will be my first brew from Hill Farmstead but I've heard great things! Drank from my Ithaca nonic pint glass.
on tap at eulogy in philly
2/11/2011
"Thanks to jedwards for sharing. Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy caramel with a frothy, half inch, milky head that dissipates into a bubbly skim. Small spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus, a floral character and light toasted malts. Taste is earthy and floral with some light bittering at the finish. There's also a slightly tart and herbal quality in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, crisp carbonation. I have to say that I found Abner to be really quite tasty and interesting, and one of the best domestic Farmhouse Ales I've had to date. That being said, I'm a bit surprised to see it characterized as a DIPA. Nonetheless, regardless of the style, it has great complexity and flavor. A truly wonderful beer."
Growler courtesy of Todd. Thanks!
"Big thanks to Sean for hooking this one up at growlerfest part one. Poured into a Lost Abbey tumbler, a burnt orange, slightly hazy, with a small off white bubbly head that sits at the edge of the glass. Huge grassy hop aroma, slightly resinous with a light straw like malt, only a hint of sweet malt. Taste is very hoppy and bitter, big grassy hops, pine resin, slightly earthy, some citrus, malty bread crust, some biscuit malts, sweet finish. Medium bodied with a light carbonation. A decent DIPA, but for the most part is just seems like a doubled up version of edward, which I prefer to this one."
Props to Sean for supplying this at our UFC 126/Showtoons event.
Thanks to FooFaa for sharing a growler of this on 2/6/11.
"Poured from a growler procured for me yesterday by jammalamma into a DFH shaped pint. The beer pours a hazy cloudy orange with a one finger bone white head. The head fades to a ring, leaving foamy, oily, resinous lacing. "
"Thanks to mikey for the growler, split with friends for our UFC tasting. "
"Drank from a growler provided by Sean into a perfect pint glass... The body is an ugly murky medium honey gold with a hint of orange. A tope head without much retention or lacing, weird looking... The aroma is light dank hops and pine with some herbal notes. A little boring, not a ton going on... The taste is better with more citrus notes coming through. The hops are pine and bitter, balanced... The mouthfeel is really nice, good heft and carbonation.... Easy to drink."
Thanks to Sean(?) for supplying this growler. Served in a Heady Topper glass.
Draft at TJ's.

"On tap at my favorite local spot, TJ's in Paoli, PA"
"Huge thanks to Andrewinski1 for bringing this gem back from his Vermont trip. Four days old when we drank it! Can't beat that with a stick! The beer pours a hazy deep straw color with about a finger of creamy white head. The aroma is simply divine. Deep blood orange and tropical fruit in the aroma with a great bitter grassy hop aroma to round out the nose. Really a nice balance of bitter and sweet on both the nose and the pallet. The flavor is a lot what the nose would lead it to be. Sweet candied grapefruit zest and orange juice to the front and it finishes nicely with a complex hop flavor. Kind of a sweet caramel finish to this one. The feel is a nice medium body with good carbonation. I'm impressed at how well this held up in the growler. Overall, it's tough to get better than this one for me. I wish this was as available as Pepsi."
Hazy medium orange color with a modest bone white head that leaves a light sticky lacing on the glass.
A: Cloudy gold color with a very nice head. lots of tightly packed carbonation bubbles taht hold really well and leave very nice lacing behind.
On Tap at Capone's in a tulip three times. 39 ounces minus foam. Review#950
Poured into a tapered glass. Hazy straw color with a thin layer of white head. Great sticky lacing.
On tap at capones. 
Pours a hazy orange with a fluffy white head that lingers at about two fingers for quite a while out of the growler. It laces beautifully down the glass through the entire session.
"On tap at Hill Farmstead on November 4, 2010. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass. Thanks to Shaun for his incredible generosity for spending a good deal of time with us."
"Poured from a Hill Farmstead swing top growler two days after acquisition at the Harvest Festival. Drank with a great dinner of roasted beets and Cabot cheddar alfredo Abner gave the meal complexity, refreshment, balance and completeness. "
"Growler brought back from autumn fest- thanks Scott!!! Pours a bright, clear orange with a thin white head. Smells like HOPS!!! Tons of citrus. Good god, like a west coast gem, but from the VT!!!! Taste is similar - a nice citrusy start but with a fairly bitter finish. Just wonderful! Thin, light mouthfeel. Can't wait to get more of this, along with the other HF beers!"
"2 liter ""genie"" shaped swing-top growler into an oversized tulip glass."
"Appearance: Orange amber, small head, not much lacing on the glass."
"Acquired yesterday fresh and poured into the Hill Farmstead tasting glass, revealing a clear deep gold body under a tall white head. Pretty colors, some lacing. Smells like serious hops with a good floral, grassy-cool citrus presence and a little honey."
"Poured into a Hill Farmstead tasting glass. Beautiful, slightly hazy orange body with a thin white head on top. Suds cling to the glass leaving some delicate lacing behind. Looks pretty good for a DIPA."
"12oz tulip at Farmhouse Tap & Grill, Burlington."
Pours a beautiful golden color with a thin head into my glass.
Time to revisit this beer; my review from the first batch appears below.
UPDATE: 10.11.13
"Cloudy gold color, thick white foam, taste is more piney and it’s on the dry side. Interesting DIPA interpretation but I like the original version better."
"Canned on 10/10/18, best by 1/29/19"
This beer didn't live up to the hype for me. The finish lacked which is what I really look for in a good beer.
Best by 01/29/19.
"I received this from @bstyle in a trade. Poured from 16 oz. can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours an opaque, golden-tangerine color with two fingers of bright white, fluffy head and lots of spotty lacing. What a dynamite aroma! Lemon, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lactose/vanilla, and soft floral hops. You can smell it the moment the top is popped. Wow, this is close to perfect: It opens with big tangerine, pineapple, and tart lemon and grapefruit. I'm also tasting ripe melon. The vanilla/lactose provides a creamy sweetness, and the Citra hops are highly flavorful and moderately bitter but without a strong bite. To me, it doesn't drink like 100 IBU. It has a pleasantly creamy mouth feel with moderate carbonation, and the 8% ABV is perfect. A second pour is a must. Overall, King Sue is exquisite - wonderful, bold flavors that balance well, and super drinkable. I'm glad to finally have tried this World Class DIPA."
Appearance - pours super turbid yellow with huge foamy white head and tons of sticky lacing.
Thank you bstyle for this
"Can dated 10/1/18. Orange Juice looking with huge Pineapple and Mango in the nose. May be the closest thing to sticking your head in a cryovac bag of Citra. More carbonated than most NE IPA’s, but not overly so. Wouldn’t hesitate to buy this again and again."
L: Pours hazy yellow in color. About a finger of a white head with minimal lacing. Looks like a watered-down orange juice in terms of color and clarity. 
"02/2016 - for a Citra dominant IPA, this ale crushes (caveat: I am not a big fan of the hop most of the time). The nose isn't off-putting, instead its inviting and aromatic; the flavors are lightly sweet, full of orange and grapefruit, yet also bold and a touch bitter; flavorful, lasting finish."
Thanks Doug for this one!
This is one great beer. 
Hazy on the pour... to be expected with the style. Absolutely beautiful in the sunlight.
"This brewery never disappoints, one of my favorite beers"
Terrific beer... terrific... 
"Very good beer, but no better than the scores of beers that breweries like Trillium and Other Half put out on a regular basis. Had this at Stone 22nd anniversary party!"
"Amazing aroma, but too dry, and fusel alcohols on the finish."
Type: 16-oz. can
"Pineapple and grapefruit aromas with a solid hop bite. Good body, but not much maltiness comes through the bitter finish."
"I love everything about this IPA. The color, smell and taste are out of this world. The King of all IPAs!"
"Been in Georgia for 10 years, best friend brought a bottle down from Chicago to Carolina Rebellion in Charlotte NC. Just had it and it is Awesome. Definitely a top rated beer. Need more southern brews to get to this quality."
"Love the bombers! Refreshingly potent, great ""back porch around the grill"" beer. Well-balanced, nice mouthfeel."
"Picked-up a single for $13.95 @ Bradford's in Plymouth! My 3rd brew from these guys, all good. Who new they made such nice brew in IA, thought just corn & mediocre football teams? This beer is outstanding, one of the best I have ever had, slight ping for the ridonculous $."
Pours a bright and sunny yellow with soft orange hues and beautifully hazed.
"22 ounce bottle into a tulip snifter. Bottled 12/11/17, had 1/14/18."
"Has been great, expect for a batch on tap last year. Did a side by side with a bomber, two completely different beers, what's up with that."
"So glad this is finally available in Chicagoland area. A beautiful color and haze. I love the soft mouthfeel too. I know mine isn't super fresh, but I couldn't find a bottling date. It might have lost some of the smell. One of my favorite IPAs now for sure."
Yummers with brewdunne
Consumed 3/18/18
"Ultra-milky pale yellow body with a fizzy, soapy white head that fades to nothing, leaving gossamer on the glass. The nose- WOW. Lots of sweet citrus, primarily of the tangerine/mango/orange juice variety. It's not like the real thing, more like each was made into a jam, but it's authentic enough. It really slaps you in the olfactory sensor neurons, in a good way. There's also an odd kind of buttery fruit pastry scent going on. The taste amplifies by magnitudes the bready/yeasty sediment taste, putting right alongside the fruits in intensity. I can't say I enjoy that addition, but this is still damn good. It's dry, but juicy, and offers a respectable but very palatable bite of bitterness. Going down, it's got medium-full weight, zippy prickles of carbonation that prick the tongue, and also distend the stomach. But it's worth it."
"Very turbid yellow appearance, essentially opaque. Citrus present in the smell and taste. Taste is excellent, but not outstanding. Really nice balance of citrus fruit and bitterness. Texture has nearly the perfect thickness and is very pleasant."
"Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Redstone Liquors, Stoneham, MA"
Bottled 11 days ago.
"In line with Tree House’s Very Green. Just a delicious, hazy DIPA that lives up to the hype!"
"On draft, poured into a snifter."
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a stemmed teku glass.
Pineapple bomb! Lucky to have toppling Goliath distributing around the Mass area now. Had the chance to sample some great beer at Julios Liquors in Westborough. Tasty beer.
"I don't remember everything, so I can't give a detailed review. I will only say that this is easily one of the top 5 IPAs I've ever tasted, and probably the best smelling IPA. Just phenomenal beer. Sometimes I'm skeptical of beers that are this highly rated, and many of them don't live up to the hype. In fact, Pseudo Sue is one of those that I thought was really overrated. "
"Hops on hops on hops. Big, balanced tropical fruit over a relatively drinkable body. Huge flavors and on par with the other top hazy IPAs. What sets this apart? I suppose it's a near perfect example of the NE IPA. You should absolutely drink this if you get the opportunity, but it's not the only world-class hop bomb."
"Surprisingly light colored, pretty much yellow, very light colored for a DIPA. Smells great, tons of hops, pungent, tropical fruit, pineapple juice, damn. Tasty citrus flavor, not too bitter, delicious. This was a high quality IPA."
"22oz bomber. Poured out a clear, golden-orange color with a small, off-white color of foam. It smelled of citrus, pine and toasted caramel. Sweet citrusy hops with hints of bitter piney-ness. Nice toasted caramel backbone."
Bottled 12/11/17
Poured from 22 oz bottle into snifter.
"If someone doesn’t like this beer, they don’t like the style."
"Appearance - From the bottle, the beer poured a bright straw yellow colow with a bubbly white head. Carbonation was visible. "
Hazy yellow orange color poured with little head. Juicy ipa with lots of grapefruit on the nose. Tons of hops forward and on the back end. Finished dry and almost salty.
"Shared a 22-oz with Alex. Blast of fresh fruity hop aroma, flavorful but smooth. Like a top NEIPA!"
L: hazy between pineapple & apple juice
Bottled 12/11/17; drank 12/26/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Lightly stamped in green; just above the TG Brewing Co insignia, I see ""12/04/2017."" Thanks Steve!"
Poured from 22 ounce bottle into glass. I take it this it is the early December bottling from the new Dacorah brewery. Bottle is stamped either 12/8/2017 or 12/9/2017 for bottling date.
"having recently drank some of the OH-trillium triangle test beers, my immediate impression in terms of comparison would be ... ""OH, SO THIS IS HOW A CITRA IPA SHOULD TASTE!!"""
"I cracked open one of the December 2017 released King Sue's. Very strong grapefruit flavor from the citra hops. For my taste, I would like it to be just a very slight touch sweeter to make it even more juicy, which would get it to a near perfect rating."
"This an amazing beer in so many ways: It's hazy and aromatic, flavorful and chewy. Lots of pine and tropical notes but also dankness. Lots of nicely sweet malts that balance the strong hop presence."
Had King Sue a few times. Really dont think it lives up to the hype.
"Appearance: Pours very cloudy, with the honey colored liquid capped by a head of two fingers in height; copious lacing"
"Pours a cloudy, hazy orange with two fingers of stark white head on top. Great head retention and lacing. Aroma is citrus and orange. While it doesn't have much depth in the aroma in terms of complexity, both notes are well done. Flavor profile is orange, with a touch of yeasty, biscuit malt in the back. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth feel, making it drink like a juice. Overall, a delightful brew, and while it may not be very complex, it nails each note well. "
Incredible citra hopped treatment by Toppling Goliath. Hops were bursting right out of my glass and even stronger while I was pouring. One of the best beers I've had in a while.
"Solid two fingers of cream white foam, even surface with a couple of pockets of larger bubbles, above average retention, the lacing forms broad streaks unto sheets that cling tenaciously. Cloudy coppery orange liquid, tiny bubbles extend in beads which resemble a spider’s web, visually active carbonation. The nose leaps right out at you, big and sassy and full of juicy tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus, then pine sap, lemongrass, damp forest floor earth, as well as more sharply contoured pineapple, mango, papaya fruit scents, not relentless and does dissolve before becoming overbearing. Full-bodied, creamy and fills the mouth cheek to cheek. The carbonation is a bit more sluggish than you’d think looking at it, this allows the caramel, coconut oil, cocoa aspects to glue it to the palate and create more concentration in the grapefruit, tangerine to lime citrus. Here more floral albeit without the lift, the pine has a looser character and there’s a doughy, yeasty quality to absorb bite from the herbaceousness. Not that dank, keeps the focus on the mango, nectarine, pineapple to kiwi fruit flavors. For its size has good drinkability but more than a bomber in a sitting would be pushing it."
Another great beer from TG. Although I love Two Juicy from Two Roads just as much and it is easier to find and cheaper
"just not another beer! 22 oz of taste good,smell good, and feel good! lucky to be from Iowa!"
Psyched to get my mitts on this brew. 22 oz bottle poured into a fancy glass; couldn't find a bottled date after a quick inspection. Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a one finger head. The orange is almost glowing - speaks to the citrus-forward taste ahead. 
22 oz. bottle
It's good. But not a five.
What is there to say. This is a fantastic beer.
look is bright but yet dark orange juice
"L-Hazy, glowing golden color...nice little light whisp of a head to it."
"King Sue is the big brother to Pseudosue in every way. Murky golden yellow haze, with minimal head but fantastic lacing. This is a huge lemony hop bomb that overwhelms the palate and the nostrils. The alcohol was overpowering to give some sweetness to counterbalance the bitterness, but renders this beer uncrushable opposing Pseudosue. Another world class beer, but I would take a Pseudosue over King Sue any day."
"Look: Yellow, hazy, with thin 1 inch head. Medium carbonation."
Pours initially a crystal clear golden color. Second pour from the 22oz. bottle provides lots of sediment and turns the beer a matte colored hazy completely opaque gold color. Thick velvety white head dissipates slowly but not completely leaving a half finger of velvety foam on top of the beer. Thick white lacing is left behind from the head and along the glass as the beer is consumed. When pouring this from a 22oz bottle Id recommend either rolling the bottle before opening or leaving the last bit behind to avoid the sediment. 
Bomber. Unreadable date.
On tap at TG 8/16/17.
"Fantastic beer. Juicy, hazy, lightly carbonated and downright delicious. The added alcohol gives it a seriousness that ddh Pseudo Sue lacks. Just about anything Toppling Goliath puts in bombers is worth your attention but all Hail the King! Had a Heady Topper along side King Sue and it is not even close. Seriously, sunshine in a can!"
Tasted from draft. Pours a cloudy golden yellow with white head. Aroma is citrus with some dank resin. Taste is extremely well balanced with nice malt backbone. Great citrus and melon fruity flavor. Just an awesome double IPA.
As soon as I popped the cap I knew this would be a tasty brew. I enjoyed the DDH Sue but this seemed to be much more promising. Aromas of citrus with some sweet juicy fruit compliments.
"If you have better, let me try it. I would love to taste it. Just brought a few bottles of toppling to the east coast and we did an all IPA taste test blind. The Toppling was the hit of the party."
"Hazy and hoppy as all get out, absolutely solid DIPA and probably one of the best you'll find in the Midwest."
"Definitely not a 100 in my book, is it great....yes! Is it world class.....no! I enjoyed the flavor, spectacular aroma, but not the best IPA I've had. If in the Midwest, hit 3 Floyds first, then TG. I am so thankful to have tried this, but it wasn't as mind blowing as I thought it was going to be"
"Just had it again a few weeks ago. Falls a little short compared to some of the brews from TH or Trill, but still a great beer"
"Cat piss aroma. Mild cat piss taste. I guess it also had a cat piss color. Overall, a very disappointing bottle of cat piss."
"Really good, as all of their beers are. I like DHPS a bit better, but it's splitting hairs."
"HAzy orange/gold beer with a nice fluffy head. There was a band of lacing and some specks left behind. Orange, pineapple, lemon zest. mango and dank aromas fly out of the glass. The taste is lightly sweet with a bit of orange and lemon zest followed by a huge pith and pine finish. This is a damn fine beer."
"Opaque deep gold (6+) pour, with frothy thick white foam; long lasting cap with heavy lacing; good clarity under cap. Dank, weedy, tropical fruit - ripe mango, pineapple, papaya and lemon rind nose. Bitter lemon zest, mango, pineapple, and papaya flavors. Medium lite + body, moderate carbonation; minimal stickiness, and light, creamy tongue coating. Overall world class; the juicy bitter hop linger balanced perfectly with the malt, and the layers of fruit flavors."
"The literal king of beers. I was lucky enough to have this on draft last weekend, and it lived up to the hype, without a doubt. I was going to do a side-by-side with Pseudo Sue but just couldn't pull myself away from the King. Hazy, orange, and lovely--there is no equal in DIPA IMHO. I also have the King Sue pint glass. SO HAPPY"
"Citrus aroma. Very hazy amber with a half-inch off-white head, receding fairly quickly, leaving some lacing. Smooth, creamy feel with a citrus/juice initial taste, leading quickly to welcome bittering in the middle, finish, and aftertaste with some pine/resin also there. This is probably my favorite TG beer so far! Just wonderful."
"Holysht! Holysht! This beer is the best Double IPA I've ever had! It started with a tangy citrus blast followed by a delicious IPA aftertaste. Five minutes after finishing my bomber from my friend Jeff and his mom, I can still feel that citrus feeling on my pallet."
"Pour is a semi opaque, light orange hue. Big frothy head, excellent lacing. Candied orange aroma, hints of citrus, pinneapple. Real pungent hop aroma. Taste is big, juicy and resinous. Nice showcase of citra hops. More candied oranges, pinneapple, hints of mango, all with a solid hoppy backbone to compliment it. Not much malt detected, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Excellent."
"L: Cloudy honey, with a thick white head that fades somewhat quickly."
Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. Awesome bottle/T-rex artwork.
"This brew is very batch dependent, but the one that dropped in Central Iowa on Feb. 2st was insane!!!"
"L- Pours a brilliant, hazy orange with a One-finger, foamy white head. Good Carbonation. Nice lacing."
"The beer, the myth, the legend... I am a total sucker for TG artwork."
"Look: yellowish with a light orange hint, creamy 1 inch head "
"Thanks Matt, I never thought I'd ever see it."
22oz bottle poured into a snifter
"Overall, the look and smell was similar to Psuedo. However, the taste had a bit more boozy and bitter hops."
L- Hazy Orange Juice 
"Pours hazy yellow. Thick, foamy, medium, Whitehead with good lacing head lasts shortly."
L: super hazy yellow with great lacing. 
"Hot on the heels of Pseudo Sue, this monstrous version is now unleashed on the Iowa beerscape. Chocked full of Citra hops and elevated to imperial status, and we've got a beast of a hop bomb on our hands that not even the brewers of Toppling Goliath can hold back."
"Incredibly smooth, juicy & tropical."
"I barely cracked this bottle (the cap wasn't even off yet) and the aromas filled the room. Had that incredible smell I love from TG IPAs like DDH sue. Has great mouthfeel that is reasonably thick. The taste is everything I wanted to be, but I have to mention that I'm getting the slightest (and I really mean slightest) alcohol burn to it. Not fair to compare them, but DDH sue was so smooth with that low ABV, it tastes noticeable in this beer by comparison. Didn't take too much away from it. "
A bomber bottle (Feb 2017) poured into a tulip glass.
"Wow. Pours a hazy bright yellow with a luscious white head. Notes of pineapple, mango, and more citrus are immediate on the nose. The first sip is juicy as hell, with all those fruits hitting you up front, but it is shortly followed by a ferocious hop bite that perfectly complements the flavor. The body is creamy and leaves you thirsting for more. "
A - hazy golden amber color that has a white head that sticks forever and leaves great lacing 
"Pours like a big glass of orange juice. Big and juicy upfront with a nice bitter hop bite at the end. As off the chart as this beer is, it still stays perfectly balanced. It's TG..so it's what you expect."
Holy cow this is good stuff. Beautiful hazy color looks like your pour orange juice. Tropical and juicy in the nose. Super smooth for a DIPA. This is well worth the hype.
"Cloudy/turbid with almost a faint peach colored appearance. Thin, fast breaking white head dings what is otherwise a great looking beer. Smell is fantastic with tropical notes of mango and pineapple attacking one nostril and dank, earthy weed attacking the other. Off the charts complex nose. Taste mirrors nose with a big initial attack of citrus - very much like fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice combined. Dankness then follows with earthy, lingering pine on a long nicely bitter finish. Feel is on the medium side with an underlying creaminess. Overall this beer deserves the hype - it is a well constructed DIPA that's a pleasure to drink."
"There's a reason this rates so highly on the BA250...honestly feels a little underrated at #23 (a/o 2/24/17). Beautiful hazy golden color with an excellent head that laces beautifully, citrusy nose with fruit undertones & is absolutely massive!, you know you're drinking a big hitter without the overbearing alcohol flavor that can be more pronounced in a double IPA. Truly a perfect beer."
Pours like orange juice from the bomber with a white head. I'm not kidding. It was bottled just over 100 hours ago and it's just like orange juice.
"Awesome DIPA. Toppling Goliath never disappoints and this is the best one of them yet. I'm happy that this is becoming more available, although still hard to find. It's worth seeking out."
L (5) - Beautiful deep orange color and haze. Dirty white head on top.
"I was able to acquire a fresh bottle via trade and was not disappointed! Huge nose and flavor from this beer, fits right in with the top contenders for the best west coast style DIPA. I'd put it right up there as being just as good as, or at least a VERY close second to Pliny (easily my favorite DIPA to date). The hops punch your palate right in the sweet spot, and the huge, citrus flavors balance this out to perfection. I will definitely be seeking this out whenever it's available!"
Zero bitterness juice bomb
This is a near perfect beer. Golden beautiful hazy in color. Strong piney/citrus aroma. Taste is wonderful sweetness. A little bitter on the end. Overall as great a DIPA as there is.
Bottle dated 12/07/16.
"Can smell the hops from a mile away. Slight haze. Poured into a tulip. Great mouthfeel. This is a great double IPA, probably the best west coast style IPA I've had."
Pours bright orange with off white head. 
"Looks good, smells good, feels good. Has a very bitter aspirin aftertaste that reduced the overall rating. Had other stuff by them that I really enjoyed but this didn't quite live up to expectations."
Drank 01-23-16.
"King Sue pours a hazy copper color with a long lasting lacing head. Big juicy floral aroma. Taste is huge, lots of citrus flavors, hints of floral and a juicy grapefruit flavor with a huge bitter kick at the end. Great feel. Overall, very big and juicily and very bitter."
Pure white head atop a golden orange hue body. Not very hazy. Fresh cut scallion and subtle tropical fruits. Taste follows with great balance. Dank and sweet. 
"Bombers were just sitting there at the Lava Lounge in Waterloo, Iowa (which, for my money, is the best beer bar in the whole US of A)."
Living in PA I was lucky enough to snag a couple bottles - thanks Oly in Madison!
"Wow talk about wow. This beer's aroma is absolutely killer. Crisp and clean, delicious. If this beer has a down side, it's the availability, put this in affordable four or six packs and I'm in."
"I was lucky to find a few bottles of this in Rochester, MN. Merry Christmas to all, but especially the people I share this with! "
"I don't know how this could be much better. Look, smell, taste are all amazing. Maybe the mouthfeel could have a little more texture but that would be it. Malt just acts as a vessel for the hop saturated goodness. Unreal beer, just plain unreal."
"This is a syrupy malt bomb, pale in color with no fruit flavors. Something is wrong. There's no way this is a top 100 IPA. Perhaps it is six months old, but I just got it in a trade last week so I have to assume it is fresh. I wish TG would put a date on the bottle."
"This beer pours a very clear gold with a large head. The aroma is absolutely astonishing - grapefruit, mandarin orange, pineapple, guava, and passionfruit come jumping out of the glass. The flavor is nearly as bold, with juicey pineapple, grapefruit, and mandarin orange, and just a hint of other tropical notes. The sweetness from the malt is present but not overbearing. The mouthfeel is reasonably full and somewhat oily. Overall this is an amazing beer - very like pseudo, but with a bit more tropical feel, and just a lot bolder."
"Bottled 9 days before review date. Poured cold from 22-ounce bottle into an oversized stemless wine glass. Impressive appearance, slightly hazy yellowish orange in color with a substantial white head that left tons of sticky lacing. Big aromas and flavors of citrus and tropical fruit, with pine resin and a hint of rosemary and light malt sweetness balancing the bold hop character. The finish is clean, crisp, and dry, a little bitter and astringent. If there is a session DIPA, this is it. Very drinkable, as each sip invites another and another. The crispness provides the perfect complement to a variety of foods. This one is not easy to come by, but it is well worth seeking out."
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 22 fl oz bottle on December 17, 2016. Tasted in a pint glass from a 22 fl oz bottle at the Field Museum on November 3, 2017. Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 22 fl oz bottle on March 7, 2018. Hazy orange yellow gold juice appearance. Huge citra aromas and flavors. While it has some hop bitterness, it goes down so smooth it's scary. Highly recommended."
"Very good but not what I expected. Poured a hay color with a very white foamy head. Aromas were very earthy and grassy, not so much citrus or pine. Would describe it having a somewhat savory and sweet smell, kind of like a salted caramel. The taste is similar, the hops present a very earthy flavor rather than citrus or pine. Maybe some cut grass or some deep plant-like flavor. Finishes sweet and full-bodied in the mouth."
Not impressed at all.
HUGE thanks to edthehead for a great trade. This beer is one of those special beers. Smells strong of grapefruit / citrus and tastes the same. So smooth for 8% - This was my first from TG and looking forward to getting my hands on some more. Top notch for sure
"L- Hazy golden color. Some foamy white head, decent lacing."
"Very solid double IPA. Citra for days. Rather opaque, and poured with a decent head. Piney with a bitter taste on the back of the tongue. Pretty smooth, I'm digging it."
Poured into snifter. Super cloudy pale gold with creamy lacing. A beer that says CITRA through and through. Strong hoppy piney citrusy smell. Taste is juicy piney hops with a mild bitterness on the back end and a slight tang. Creamy mouth feel. This one's a winner.
Poured into a snifter from 22 oz bomber. I had beer from a pseudo sue bomber a little before getting to this guy.
Perfect
Poured from a 750ml bottle to a chardonnay glass at 50 F
"Citra is my favorite hop, so I've been wanting to give this a shot for a long time. "
L - hazy golden yellow. Looks like a NE style IPA haze bomb. Nice white head that forms.
"L: Hazy, light gold yellow."
Poured into a King Sue teku.
This is top of the line in terms of IIPA's.
"Enjoyed 9 day old King Sue... Fresh is best! Poured hazy light orange with fluffy white head that retained well for an IPA and laced down the glass. Grapefruit and orange zest scent with flavor that was citrus forward with subtle mango. Very juicy. The booze was hidden very well, smooth, yet crisp mouthfeel. Top 3 double IPA for sure!"
Toppling Goliath King Sue
5000th review!
"Received in a trade, shared with JLindros."
Big thanks to rudzud for finally gitting to this beer
Poured into a tulip glass from a bomber with no date that I can see. 
Thanks for the trade bpolgaze.
"Got this from a trade from Collin R, thanks dude! and it was delicious! If you love Citra you will love this DIPA!"
"been waiting a long time to put my lips to this one, and finally got the chance in nebraska of all places (not a knock, the beer scene here is really booming!). this is one of the best toppling goliath beers i have had, and its surely worthy of the hype. it pours a yellow nectar color, hazy and pale but very bright and without visible bits of sediment. the head is tall and white and permanent, and almost acts as a net to catch all the citra hop goodness. this is not a varietal i have liked much in most single hop contexts, not versatile enough, but i think this is only citra, and its amazing. the soft lemon is there, a lot more oil than i am used to from it, and frankly quite a lot more bitterness too. i have never known citra to be quite this big and powerful, so i really dig that aspect of it too. notes pf pineapple and mango in here too, lots of tropical hop elements. pale and pils type malts, maybe a little wheat, some fluffy body for sure, but you would never know this is as strong as it is, it doesnt feel or taste that way on the grain side or in terms of booziness, which there is none of. just juicy tropical hops and appropriate bitterness in the end, floral honey, sweet lemon curd, and just the right amount of cleaning it up, highly refined but still a little rugged at the same time. this might be the best expression of citra hops i have ever known, really stunning stuff. fresh too, i am sure that makes all the difference. near the top of the hoppy beer list for me in 2016, thanks to my friend in omaha for so graciously sharing this one (and other) with me!!!"
"Bright golden hue, lightly cloudy, big puffy head, and fantastic lace. Dank fruity hops burst in the aroma. Notes of sweet grapefruit, juicy citrus, light mango, pineapple, and light dank. Medium body, great carbonation punch keeps it crisp, lightly dry and amazing drinkability for 8%. A truly amazing DIPA, big juicy monster of a beer."
"2016 Boise stone fruit tasting on 8/27. Bottle share, thanks to Steve. Hefty golden orange body, small fluffy beige head. Aroma hints at what’s to follow, piney hops and juicy citrus. Flavor follows on in spades, hoppy, dank, musty, piney. But in a good way...no, in a great way. Definitely worthy of its rep.."
"Most of the reviews are spot-on. This just adds density to an already great Pseudo Sue product. I was impressed by the balance. Most DIPAs go over the top and don't have a good balance, but King Sue delivers. Outstanding citra nose. A perfect bomber if that's all you want for the night. Adding note after tasting new cans from Decorah. Fabulous again after a bad bomber batch in December. Such ripe orange followed by rind in agreat way. Upping my score."
My long awaited first taste of King sue. Bottled 8/5 acquired in trade. Thanks Travis. 
"Managed to nab one of the last two bottles the store had when I overheard an employee talking about them. Awesome! Pours a clear, orange color with a big white foam head with moderate retention. "
This beer is outstanding. This is how you do a Double IPA style beer.
08/14/2016
"Appearance: Clear yellow-gold, huge head."
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a chalice. 
A great beer. Very nice tropical notes and just the right amount of bitterness. I like this more than Julius.
Good beer from Toppling Goliath. Was a bit disappointed with all the Hype around it.
"Look - Medium orange color, light haze. Looks like they've started filtering this beer. First time I had it, it was opaque. Thick film head, good retention."
"I don't have many ""whalez,"" but this is one of them. I've been trying for a couple of years to secure this and finally did so today. Uber fresh (The King was bottled today), this is an exquisitely beautiful beer. It's somewhere between a brilliant straw color and burnt orange, not clear but also not ""murky"" like the Northeast iterations of the style. Lacing remains on the glass as you empty the glass, the body supporting 1-1/2 fingers of off-white head after an aggressive pour into a Hopslam tulip (my favorite beer glass)."
"Ok, wow. I have to be honest, I was expecting to be let down by this beer a little. It spent 5 days in shipping during a heat wave, and then 4 hours on my cement front steps in the sun before I put in the fridge. Also, it was a bit over 3 weeks old after it got here. Despite all that, this beer totally blew me away, and is amongst the best beers I've ever had. It pours a beautiful hazy orange with a very generous and creamy white head that leaves tons of lacing. The aroma features tropical fruits that include pineapple and mango, along with grapefruit peel and sugary malts. It's extremely juicy with and balanced. I love the malt backbone in this beer, it really brings out all the best citra can offer. I love the soft bitterness in the feel. The body is very silky yet well carbonated and it's not boozy at all. Overall this beer is just incredible. I haven't even finished it and am looking forward to the next time I can get my hands on it."
Smell: A tropical citrus fruit Bomb! Pineapple and mango some
Bold golden color with fluffy white head that lasts. Some lacing. Grapefruit and melon in the nose. Hoppy tropical fruit on palate. Good carbonation and mouth feel. Overall nice balanced and bold DIPA.
This is a perfect double IPA. Just absolutely delicious in every way. If you like double IPAs and you find this beer in front of you. You WILL enjoy it!
Pours darker golden. Very strong grapefruit/tropical fruit smell. Similar grapefruit notes on the initial taste with slight bitter finish. Overall a very well done beer. I would have to taste this side by side with Psuedo Sue to see which one I prefer more.
Fresh bottle drank on 7/2
"A: Moderately hazy with a glowing, dark orange-yellow hue. Soft off-white head leaves thick lacing around the glass."
22 fl oz bottle sealed with silver TG pressure cap.
"From a Very Fresh Bomber it poured a hazy golden yellow color with a great looking 1 finger head streaks of lacing thru -out. Smell was all tropical/citrus. Taste follows nose incredible burst of pineapple,peach,papaya,mango and citrus sweet and smooth on the mouth feel with ABV well hidden , This is one of the top 5 DIPA""S ever had"
Why wouldn't you
It was really hard NOT giving this 5 in everything. Appearance is super hazy. Smell is absolutely amazing. Tropical fruit bomb. Taste follows the smell perfectly. Feel is incredibly smooth. Best DIPA or IPA I have ever had.
"Fortunate to try a two day old bottle. Delicous, simply delicious. Incredibly soft mouthfeel for an IPA. No perceptible malty sweetness which I appreciate in a good DIPA. Hopped to the gills but not bitter at all. Blah, blah NE style juicy DIPAs, I'd choose this any day of the week over those. I'll call out a beer if it does not live up to the hype but this one does. Hope I get a chance to try it again. Outstanding."
Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Bottled 6/24/16.
L: super cloudy orangish yellowish with a white head
"Bought a case of 12 22oz bombers at King Sue release day 6/24/16. Well worth the 2 1/2 hour drive to come home with this beer. Poured into 2 TG chalice glasses for my wife and I to share. We were not dissapointed. The flavor compared to the original PsuedoSue (which I think has great citra hop flavor) doesn't compare. This screams flavor, amazing citra hop flavor smacking you in the face. This one is in my top 3 IPAs I've ever tried along with Dinner and Pliny The Elder. Look forward to trying more of the 22 oz bombers soon."
"Lucky to try this one, fresh from Iowa. Ugly beer, floaties and an odd haze. Pretty in the way that you know what will come with it. Aroma is nice citrus, very grapefruity. Nice and smooth flavor, fantastic complexity from the bitter to the fruit. Little grainy. World class."
"Awesome beer! A genuine hop bomb. Among the best around. Could compete with treehouse' best. Look forward to this coming out again and will trade for again. If you can get your hands on it, by all mean do it"
"L: golden/orange color, generous white head "
Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a gigantic pillowy head that leaves great lacing. 
"Very Excited to try this beer as I love the pseudoSue! 22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Golden with light to no haze and a quarter inch head that hangs around. lots of pine and floral notes in the nose. Taste is similar taste with the addition of mild pops of citrus. Overall a great DIPA. However, I still prefer the pseudo."
"First time I had this was on draft at Hunahpu's Day 2016, however I've had it on draft and from bottles since, and it's only continued to impress me more--especially in its ability to hold up months and months after bottling."
"The is a revisit review! I had this beer for the first time a year ago! This time I had it today 03/22/17. No date on the 22oz bomber but I imagine it's not too old, I dig the new label. This beer was poured into a veil brewing company tulip glass and it looks like every other yellow murky juicy haze hop bomb but with an inch of frothy white head. The smell is amazing, I get nothing but blended tropical fruits with more and more candied pineapple notes! I could literally smell this beast all day long and not get tired of it. The taste starts like tropical fruits, the mid palate I get some grapefruit/pine flavors followed by some bready and caramel malts. The beer has a fuller feel but not on the chewy side, and definitely shows the alcohol and bitterness as it warms ( it only warmed because I had the bomber to myself and left it out of the fridge when consuming the first half of the bottle). Overall this is great and I really want to have this beer when it's fresh as can be! Cheers."
Thanks to Neil from Iowa for this baby. He sent it to my beer guru and I got to split it.
"Smell explodes with citrus hops. Flavor matches with a citrus hop bomb and no bitterness at all. Nice body to give it a little chewiness. No alcohol noticed. This one really delivers as one of the best IPAs I've had. And just when I was really happy with it, the bottom unfiltered OJ looking stuff raised it to another level. A must have beer."
"Fortunate enough to have this beer while waiting in line at Other Half this past Saturday. This was the first beer that I've had that was brewed in Iowa and from what I've seen, this may be the best offering to come out of the Hawkeye State. Tropical, deceptively strong, and juicy, this went down easily while having a flavor profile that stuck around for the duration!"
"I tried the Pseudo Sue before this one and thought that was great, but when I had the King Sue I was taken aback! It is an incredible beer! Worth the trip to this town just for this beer!"
"Yeah, this beer is the real deal. Looks great. Tastes great. Everything I look for in an IPA. Not too sweet or boozy like a lot of doubles can get. Still light, aggressively hoppy, bitter, and the alcohol is masked perfectly. Truly excellent beer."
"Got to try this beer with very hazy, kern citra. All three were amazing, but I guess if I had to pick I put this one in third. But man what a great great beer. Tasted really really good. Tasted better than it smelled. Wish I could get another pour of this to sit back and enjoy."
"So excited to try this, and am so grateful for the person who helped me get the King. I let it sit for a twenty to thirty minutes so the beer breathes."
"Bomber courtesy of a great trade partner. Pours a hazy straw color, amazing piney dank aroma explodes from the glass. Taste is balanced with a blast of hops, juicy and tropical, that smoothly finishes with no lingering bitterness. Amazing beer, glad I was able to try."
"Enjoyed this beer at Cigar City's Hunahpu's Day 2016 in Tampa, FL. After trying PsuedoSue a few times, I was excited to try King Sue. It did not disappoint and is an excellent IPA showcasing citra hops (one of my favorite hop varietals). Very tasty!"
Poured from a bottle that was bottled less than two weeks ago. 
"Hazy orange juice, fluffy white head with tight bubbles"
Great beer. That being said would have a TH Green over this any day of the week.
Served on tap at TG in a tulip:
Received this in a recent trade and no wonder why they call it King Sue!
"Hazy, can smell from across the room. Big citrus notes, excellent balance and crazy smooth for a DIPA."
Beautiful color. Nice citrus aroma. Subtle hops - not as explosive as I expected. A mature IPA for easy drinking. Doesn't have to destroy the palate to deliver a good drinking experience.
Bottled last week! Pours yellow-orange and color with a hazy appearance. Tons of orange and melon on both the aroma and taste. Head is fluffy and hangs around until the last drop. Great stuff!
Can into tulip glass. Fresh. 
"This one is almost so good that I can't describe it. The bottle we opened was super fresh, and it made a big difference. So much hoppy floralness on the nose and the flavor was so complex and balanced."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color. Aroma is a clean light citrus. Flavor is very balanced. Notes of citrus a little pine and tropical fruit. Leaves a great lingering aftertaste of juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Overall this is a perfect beer, well balanced with great flavor."
Bottled 1 week ago exactly and kept cold at least the majority of the time. 
"All things considered, I'd say this is a bit overrated. Prefer Sosus."
"This is a fantastic beer. Had it blind, along with Dinner, PTE, Heady, swish and Epiphany. This one beat the rest out. Citrusy and refreshing, and clean. Piney and a lot of citrus, hits the mouth perfectly and leaves instantly, crisp flavor. I would like to have a redo with this Dinner and Swish as they were all the top 3 that night, and really see if this is as good as i remember."
"Love it when I can get my hands on this one. Thankfully I live in Iowa. I couldn't imagine relying on someone 5 states away for this one. Citra hop beers have become the favorites of many, including me, and this is probably in the to 2 or 3 for citra hop beers. Do not pass it up if you have the chance to try it."
"Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a solid, one finger broad head, which turns out to be utmost stable while revealing big, spongy bubbles."
"As with all the IPA's I've had from Toppling Goliath, I found this one to be a little over-hyped. Overall, I do agree that it's a great example of a DIPA, but I would not seek it out again, especially with the fairly hard process it was to procure it in the first place. I'm glad I've tried it, but now I'm moving on!"
Tried this past week at Erics bourbon tasting (thanks greatly to Scott for brining this) Nice pale orange pour with a small foamy head. Loads of orange and grapefruit and mango. Balanced despite all the IBU's. Pretty big and tasty. Delish. :) I can see what the hype is about
22oz. bottle poured into snifter.
"Wonderful look, smell, and feel. My only real issue is that I had this after Xhops Gold and it just doesn't have the depth of hop characteristics (by virtue of being single hop). It is still undoubtedly world class."
"Long live the king. Easily the best iipa I've ever had. Just a pineapple, peach, mango, melon bomb. Nice juicy fruit malt build that reminds me of treehouse. This is absolutely outrageous. Creamy mouthfeel."
Poured my tulip glass half way. A lovely orange / arpicot color with a touch of a white head that quickly faded. However there is a nice lacing left behind. Also on the cloudy side just how I like it. 
"My second try with the King. Poured into a TGB snifter. Hazy golden color. Great Citra nose. Very smooth and balanced, especially as it warms. It's a shame this is not more widely available. Other East Coast IPAs are coming on strong but Sue is still the King!!!"
That is phenomenal. Very well done.
An excellent DIPA. Citra and tropical notes on the tongue and nose. No bitterness. Amazing beer!
This beer is flawless. Hard to top a fresh King Sue. For anyone who enjoys a DIPA I could not make a better recommendation. So glad I've had the opportunity to try this!
12/22/2015 bottle date had on 01/01/16.
Poured into a pint glass- 
"Disclaimer: A) This is one of my all time wants, but B) I have been pretty discouraged with this brewery for dropping out of the EBF twice in a row, so there is no love lost for TG but quality is quality damnit! And I needed to try a TG hop whale"
"Bottle received as an extra. Seriously. I was geeking out. Drank on Christmas Eve, just 3 days after bottling."
This is by far one of my favorite IPA's. I could not respect TG any more for coming out with a beer like this. If you are an IPA fan than this is a must have.
Very solid DIPA that compares to some New England IPA's. A pleasure to drink and a fantastic offering from TG.
"Pour - murky, burnt orange "
L- medium straw color and nice white lacing
"Cheers to CJ for hooking me up with this one. Super fresh bomber from the original brewer, none of that half-breed stuff from a few months ago. Poured into a snifter."
"First Toppling Goliath brew ever tasted, and I was impressed. Wicked aromatic hints of tropical fruits. Tastes of citrus fruits, and for a DIPA, the harshness one would expect is simply not there. Great brew all around."
"Pours cloudy orange with a one finger head. Smells strong of citrus and tropical fruits. Taste is sweet orange and mango. Not overly bitter despite all the IBU's. Creamy mango. Really a lot of citrus and calmness for a double IPA. Overall, pretty delicious. Maybe doesn't live quite up to all the MASSIVE hype, but very good just the same."
Visited the brewery last week and as soon as she poured in I knew it was special. It was the most delicious double IPA I've ever tasted. Great feel and incredibly balanced almost such a creamy taste to it. Highly recommend trying..
"A - Hazy Orange, finger of foam, looks great "
"Had yesterday (8/25/15) on-tap at Three Cellars, Franklin, WI - reviewed from notes:"
"Enjoyed this on tap at Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. A nice 10 ounce pour into a snifter. The beer is a hazy amber. It has a finger of foam. Good retention and lacing. The aroma is fantastic. Wonderful tropical fruits. A bit of citrus. I have to say I love citra hops. The flavor is great too, but truth be told, for only 8% ABV, I'm of the opinion the alcohol should be better hidden. Minor complaint... Great feel... Smooth and full bodied. Overall, I'm glad I finally got to try this one. I'd gladly drink it on a regular basis. Still think I prefer the regular Sue though. Cheers!"
On tap at the Nova into a snifter
"My second time having this beer, first time from the tap. (Disclaimer: This was approximately one week ago.)"
"LC from previous notes. 2 week old bottle, so pretty fresh. For a single hopped DIPA, this is tough to beat. It deserves the hype, but this still isn't quite as good as the Vt/Trillium/Treehouse big boys, IMO."
"pours a hazy orange color, like peach juice. lacing on this is pretty sweet too. smell and taste are almost identical, bursts of citrus fruits and piney hops. earthy. amazing beer!"
Had this beer on draft at the brewery. 
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Look is a hazy golden body topped by 3/4 inch fluffy white head. Smell was citrusy, maybe lemon, some honey sweetness, and some grapefruit. Taste was led by a tropical pineapple and mango citrus, some honey and a subtle bitterness. A little light in the mouth, medium carbonation, not much staying power. Overall this is not a standout in my book, well integrated, but just doesn't have the intensity of flavor that I prefer."
"Look-color is a slightly hazy gold, a gentle pour resulted in a finger of cream colored head that clings the glass nicely."
A - Beautiful looking IIPA here. Pours an opaque golden yellow body with a one finger eggshell head. Minimal lacing and retention.
"Bomber. Cloudy orange. Fruity citrus aroma. The taste of this one is juicy, not too sweet, with a perfect balance of citrusy hops. As far as mouthfeel, is there a softer IPA? Overall this beer is something else, top of my list."
Great double IPA. Nose is wonderful strong citrus with a equal citrus body and finish. Much better than its little brother pseudo sue. Thumbs up
"Poured from a bomber that I'm pretty sure was bottled on 7/17/15. Consumed on 8/3/15. Promptly decided to kick my own ass for not drinking this 5 or 6 days ago when acquired in a trade. Only negative thing I have to say about this beer was that it was only 22oz. I didn't want it to end and couldn't stop drinking it. I will caveat my review with the fact that I am an absolute sucker for Citra hopped beers, but this one was outstanding and worth the hype. "
"A - Pours a very hazy (almost opaque) medium orange color with a thick, frothy white sticky head."
"Bottled on 7/17/15 and poured into a King Sue Teku. Right off the bat, it is well balanced in the smell and the taste. Excellent blend of hops and malt in this double IPA. Smooth and perfect carbonation. First time trying King Sue and it's a stunner."
Bottled on date of either 7/1/15 or 7/17/15 (I can't tell).
The beer comes in a hazy rich dark orange/amber color. A vibrant glowing orange.
"First time trying the King. The smell is of dank tropical fruits. The taste follows the nose. Nice resin. You taste the alcohol. Creamy carbonation that lingers. Overall a very good beer. I would not say world class, but definitely worthy."
"This one was billed as ""the best DIPA ever"" and ""even better than Double Sunshine,"" so after nearly a year of searching, I was thrilled to be able to try it."
"Beautiful golden brew, slightly hazy and translucent. Big fluffy white head."
Wow. This was much better than anticipated. From a bomber dated 7/17/2015.
"Still incredible the last time I had it, but Tree House so yeah."
"IMO, King Sue doesn't live up to the hype. While it is certainly a solid DIPA, I feel some of TG's standard lineup (Intergalactic Warrior, Zeelander) are of higher quality than this beer. Glad I got to try it, but not something I feel is worth a special trip out to Decorah to pick up."
"Just fantastic fresh bottled Three days ago. Orange hazy appearance, tropical nose, Tropical flavors up front, great malt backbone huge floral bouquet, with that nice resin with a touch of smooth booze. Love it!"
"Tried this the day after it was bottled, and it was worth the drive to get it. Beautiful hazy golden color, small white head. Great citrus/floral aroma. The taste and feel both world class. Pseudo Sue is a great beer, but it bows to the King."
Pure golden color with a medium haziness. Citrus and pine aroma. Not overpowering but still strong aroma (especially for a 2 month old beer). Flavor follows perfectly. Great citrus with middle pine bitterness. Very smooth with no lingering bitterness. Good malt balance. Alcohol hidden very well.
"I'm a big fan of pseudo Sue. Time to give a bomber of big brother a drink. Poured into my darkness snifter this brew has a formidable white head atop a golden orange color that is fairly clear. Aroma is big time citra. Dank, with that tropical mango, tangerine aroma. I could smell this all day. After a few drinks...I could drink this all day too. This is so good. Citra rules the day. It's all citra but not bitter at all. Malt bill is clean and complements the citra perfectly. Just the right amount of carbonation with a bit of warming in the belly. . I didn't think a beer could be better than regular Sue. This is the one. I need more!!!"
This is truly remarkable stuff. Hard to think of a better beer.
"Bomber into a tulip. Thanks for sharing, CJ!"
Overhyped and overrated. Solid but not earth shattering. Much better stuff around these days. 'Twas disappoint
"Orange gold color. Dank and tropical. Lots of citrus. Pineapple and papaya. Grapefruit. Juicy and hop resiny. really solid, but a bit overhyped."
"Great DIPA here. Lots of fruit and tropical notes on the nose. Mango, pineapple, and peach come through. Taste is also very fruit forward and juicy. Citra has become one of my favorite hops and beers like this are the reason why."
"Unbelievable citrus smell. Not overly bitter. TG, really well done"
Great Beer. Best Citra IPA. PERIOD
"Given the hype, and consumed alongside some hoppy Vermont beers, this was a little disappointing. It simply did not hold up against the stiff competition."
Ryan. Bro.
Pours a deep goldenrod yellow. The citra hops really shine with strong aromas of citrus fruits and tropical fruits like mango. The body is very juicy and drinkable with a very light bitter finish. I feel like it's close to an orange juice IPA. Superb!
"Simply put, this is a great exhibition for Citra. Juicy. Juicy. Juicy. Smooth and well balanced. Fresh squeezed goodness. Having just had HF Double Citra, I would rate this one just a touch lower. The creamy mouthfeel and nose on Double Citra put it ahead. But let's leave the beer nerd wanking aside. This is a world class beer. Seek it out."
Poured from bottle into tulip glass.
"Look: Faded orange, gorgeous body that is turbid and opaque. When held up to the sun, obviously, it does not penetrate. This is the best body I have witnessed in an imperial IPA. The white head is grand, pillow puffy, and dense. Tacky curtains. "
Great brew.
"Obtained in a beer trade and poured into a snifter glass. The aroma hits you the second the bottle is open. Appearance looks similar to orange juice. Taste was super refreshing and almost like an amped up PseudoSue. Overall, this was an awesome beer and I recommend getting your hands on one. If not, you can always try to get PseudoSue haha. Cheers!"
Had this a few weeks ago and was so impressed by how good it was. Dry hop smell which instantly makes me think that this is going to be a good beer. Cloudy appearance and amazing flavor
"Spring 2015 batch (consumed 5/13/15, and then again on 5/15/15):"
"Quite possibly the most over hyped IPA I have ever had. It is very good, but by no means better than fresh Pseudosue."
"A - Pours a glowing orange color with 2 fingers of dense, near white head. immense lacing, perfect retention."
The King!
"Pours an apricot tinged light orange color with lots of hop haze. Finger of head diminishes to a light filmmupon sipping. Nose brings pineapple, orange and sweet clover to mind. Taste is interesting in that the citrusy flavors meld beautifully with the piney and floral hop flavors right up front - which to my palate is different than most DIPAs that seem to be citrus forward followed with a hoppy finish. Result here is fantastic. As a result the finish isn't at all tounge scraping like so many others. TG nails it Again."
"Pour is completely hazed deep amber with about 1 inch of tight white head and a decent lacing. Nose is very hoppy, tons of citra, very melon rind and musky, gets a touch boozy and a little green. Flavor is similar, below the quality of pseudo sue, citra blast, musky rind, gets boozy mid to late palate and bitterness and acidity are a touch high. Body gets a touch syrupy and messy, lighter carb. Falls a bit short of the masterpiece that is pseudo sue"
"The king, finally getting a chance, huge thanks to andrewpalmer for this bad boy. Poured into a sn perfect pint paired with the warriors playoffs."
"This is like a cranked up PseudoSue to me, I really enjoyed it! Light in color like PS, great aroma, and smooth for a DIPA. Just a little harsh on the finish."
"Bottle shared by Will yesterday, thanks so much dude."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter. Got this in a trade with Hawkeye44544, thank you!"
A huge thanks to Jeff for this one. 22oz. bomber into a Duvel tulip. Bottled on 5/12/15. 
"I got this from my new friend, Omensetter, who leaves in proximity to the brewery! I never thought I would get a chance at this beer and he seriously hooked me up! And I love the graphics on the label with the T-Rex I'm in love!"
L - Pours a light orange/yellow. Golden beach sunset
Citra Bomb. Good for what it is. Citra is just not my thing.
"Flat, under carbinated no where near worth the hype. Pipeworks citra ninja better. Tg ipas just don't do it for me"
Poured from a bomber into a snifter--phenom bottle trade a golden yellow with a white head.
Smells like sour citrus candy. Soft bitterness enlightens a balanced malt base - not too sweet or biscuity. Settles into a pleasant orange marmalade. Body drinks like a champ. Probably the best beer I've had from TG in two+ years
Initial review 4.49
"Hazy yellow with thick foamy head. Looks like pineapple juice. Smell is grassy, mild, again pineapple or Orange Juice. Citrus hops with moderate bitterness, also grassy (seems to be Toppling Goliaths calling card) and earthy. Reminds me of an American Pale Ale rather than a Double IPA. Truth be told I'd prefer PsuedoSue or Light Speed over this."
wow... so citrus.. love the flavor of this.. pours a orangish color.. smells awesome.. unreal brew
"On tap at Dexter's in Madison for Great Taste 2015. Tasted much better then the 3-4 bottles I had of it (first batch of 2015). Very good beer from the bottle, mind blowing beer on tap."
"Wonderful clean finish, just pure gold!"
Appearance - Golden amber hue.
"The King. It's comparable to pseudoSue, but with a lot more hops and a heavier mouthfeel. Incredibly smooth and juicy. Excellent display of the citra hop - my absolute favorite. If you can get your hands on this, try it."
One of the top 5 IPA's ive ever had. Delicious on every level.
Amazing! A beer that is 100+ibu and 8.5 abv should not be this smooth. Has a very grapefruity smell. Hint of orange in the nose with a full body IBU taste and an incredible Finish. Decent body and nice hazy color. I tried this along side a Permanent Funeral by 3 floyds that i gave equal reviews and the King is justly named.
Oh you beautiful sue...so perfect in what it is!
"amazing smell and taste of tropical orange juice, nice malty backbone...superb beer."
"On tap at Hunahpu’s Day 2014 served in souvenir taster. Hazy yellow-orange body with a very tall white head. I got the very last pour, so it was coming out of a pitcher that was used to let the foam settle after the keg kicked. Lots of lacing and a persistent head. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits, grass, and some bready malts once you cut through the Citra onslaught. Taste is a light citrus/tropical sweetness initially followed by moderate grass and citrus peel bitterness on the finish. Medium body, very creamy texture (thought this might have been because the keg kicked, but others seem to agree), average to soft carbonation, dry finish with a nice lingering bitterness."
Look- The shiny glimmering light from the King's Crown.
"Murky and oddly oxidized, though I was told the bottle was fresh. No bottle date unfortunately."
"If you have a chance to get a bottle, take it! Great bitter, great tropical fruit. Not malty at all! A velvety mouth feel and a sweet finish! Great job brewers!"
Favorite DIPA of all time! Lovely Orange almost like a Mimosa. Citrus explosion!
Great beer.
Tasted from Growler and bottle release. Stunningly good. Though B1 was MUCH jucier.
Bomber shared by Doopie a few weeks back. Originally brought to us by youbrewidrink! This one and the Sosus were put up together. Thanks for the share guys!
Pours a hazy dark amber in the glass with half a finger of head and some pronounced lacing along the rim.
Bottle from the brewery shared by RussianDragon. Many thanks. This was one of my top wants.
Simply amazing. Dank fresh tropical bouquet of citrus hops. Super refreshing and easy to drink but packed w flavor!
Bottle shared by Clark at Peg’s. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Fruity hop aromas. Tropical fruit hop notes dominate the show. Just enough smooth caramel malt undercurrents to keep her nicely balanced. Fantastic body and mouthfeel. An outstanding DIPA....
Bottled less than two weeks ago. Tulip glass.
"This beer gives wave after wave of lush tropical fruit from start to finish. Taste the alcohol, but totally balanced, it's not overpowering at all. Could (not should) drink this all day."
"East coast, opaque yellowish-orange"
"Fresh bottle in trade from Joe basically as an extra. Huge thanks. Pours super murky yellow colored with a big fluffy white head. Really ugly to be honest. Aroma of sweet hop nectar, pineapples, pine needles, dank mustiness. Flavor is lots and lots of sweet pineapples balanced alongside huge bitter pine. Pretty chewey and dry, medium plus carbonation, crisp refreshing finish. Really nice DIPA on the bitter end of the spectrum. Quite the hype monster, and this is excellent but doesn't live up to that. Doesn't hold a candle to Pseudo for me, which is saying something because this is very good. Definitely worth getting but don't bend over backward for it."
"Aroma: Loads of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, dank hops, and a little pine. Absolutely amazing smell to this beer!"
Saved for my #400 rating! Not disappointed as king sue is one of the best I've had. Fantastic nose with my favorite citrus smell. Taste is on par with smell which is a A+ for me! Many thanks to bestin for this gem. If big hop citrus forward beers are your thing it's a must try!
"A - Pours hazy golden orange with a nice one finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving sticky webs of lace on the glass."
2014 batch I gave a 5.
"Pours like diluted orange juice with a fluffy head. Beautiful beer. Definitely get Citra on the nose. Tangerines, navel oranges, hint of melon coming through. Not as bold of an aroma as I expected, though. Flavor is sweet citrus fruits and some noticeable booze. Not an insane amount, but I really feel the level of booze detracts from the beer, cutting the hop character. Mouthfeel is excellent with the flavor lingering on the buds, and quite a full body, too. Expected a lot more from this beer. It's still awesome, just not as good as I anticipated. Would love to give it a go next time they brew it."
"Thanks TboneRN for the trade! Pours a hazy orange with a thick white head with good retention. On those nose, lots of tropical fruit and citrus with hints of pine resin and biscuity malt. The palate follows the nose, though dialed down just a bit. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Very sticky. Overall, an outstanding DIPA, top three in my opinion."
"Pours super hazy, just like a glass of orange juice. Thin white head with some retention. Nose is absolutely juicy as can be. Heavy citra brings on notes of orange, mango, pineapple and peach with undertones of floral notes. Not much else here as the citra steals the show. The taste pretty much matches the nose. Straight citra amplified to the nth degree, I have not had a more juicy beer. The hops are obviously all late additions as they don't give off much bitterness at all. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. This beer is an experience. Very drinkable for the ABV and definitely worth giving a try."
Simply amazing in every way. May god bless the lady that sent me this.
Many thanks to kenzilka007 for bringing me some of this storied nectar from the vaults of Decorah. 22 oz. bomber split with my wife. 
Appearance: Hazy as hell. An unpasteurized orange juice with a half finger of fluffy head. Nice lacing. Gorgeous beer.
22 oz bomber poured into 2 teku glasses and shared with my lucky wife. 
"Pours extremely hazy, half finger of white head, I have come to expect the haziness in some of TGs IPAS, I have found they taste better when all that hop residue is in there"
"First bottled batch, bottled 1 day prior to review. (Note: I had this on tap twice previously and thought it was far better so perhaps the first bottled batch was a bit off…still great though)"
From 5/4/14
"I look forward to this beer so much! It falls off fairly quickly, in my opinion, but when fresh...it's just outstanding, good thing I live only 40 miles from them!"
"Had on tap, February 2014. Deelicious. Tropical storm of greatness, with just enough bitterness on the palate."
State of the art. That is how I describe this beer. 
On tap during Madison Craft Beer Week...
Had on tap in 2014. 
"Gotta try this again: with all the fawning reviews, here, I must be missing something. Or maybe it was something I ate. This is clearly a quality brew. It's just not anywhere near what I want in a truly great IIPA -- where's the malt, where's the sweetness?"
Poured from a leaky growler into a Prairie Teku glass. Reviewed from notes.
"Easily the best DIPA I've had. This smells and tastes like grapefruit juice with enough sweetness to round off that bite. Holy smokes was this excellent on draft at DLD. Incredible scent jumps out of the glass, and the taste actually delivers on that smell where so many do not. Just resiny enough but still slick. Looks like a hazy golden glass of juice. Top notch. A little boozy on the finish as it warms."
This beer can be drank on-tap. This pour is a creamy orange color with a white head. Aromas consist of grapefruit and fruitiness. The flavor is just as it smells with some citrus hints. There is both a strong taste and aftertaste. Great flavor all together!!
"Incredibly hazy - like pulpy orange juice. Very minimal head but impressive looking beer. One of the crazier aromas - incredibly dank - huge citrus, almost like a cat pee/sweat type of astringency, sweet fruits, pine, very very bright citrus fruits. Taste is very clean and smooth - a vibrant wash of the aforementioned flavors. "
Huge thanks to Bilco for sharing this madness.
64oz brown TG growler pour
"A: Cloudy, murky light orange color. Almost no head. A little reminiscent of chicken stock."
64oz screwtop growler poured into a Toppling Goliath Assassin Teku.
Prince Kern Double Citra
"Pours orange like an orange Julius. Aroma is full on tropical fruit and skunky weed. Pine tar is hanging out in the background, not overwhelming. Minimal malt profile going on. Medium bitterness, plenty dry but with a nice body to it. Just a big juicy brew, plenty tame."
A-EBF sample. Cloudy orange yellow. 
This pours out as a hazy golden color with a white head on top. Great head retention and lacing. The aroma of this beer is huge with citra hops. Smells fantastic! The taste of the beer is ripe with Tropical hops flavors. The feel is very drinkable. Overall it's outstanding.
"Dank orange juice. Grapefruit pith, pine, tangerine, maybe a bit of onion, pineapple, orange peel and lemon zest. Fairly strong cracker malt base. Some raw hop bitterness. Not too sweet with tons of citrus bitterness. Somewhat dry finish. Obviously very solid."
"On tap at Toppling Goliath's taproom. 12oz pour in an unlabeled chalice today, 3/8/2014."
On tap at TG brewery along with Mornin' Delight and all their other wonderful beers
On tap at Hunahpu's Day. Served in a taster.
Week old growler screw top tang was shipped. Pours perfect juicy golden with nice white head. Smell bursting with citrus beyond belief and taste matches right up to the nose but once you get to the carb it's not quite
"Simply put, this is the perfect IPA. "
"I didnt think there could be another beer I wouldn't change anything about. This is it along with its little brother. Amazing through and through. Same flavor profile as Pseudo Sue, but it's obviously bolder and bigger, but equally as balanced. Better than Pseudo Sue though? I don't think so, but just as good. Highly recommend."
Growler filled 2/22/2014 and enjoyed 3/1/2014. Poured into a Toppling Goliath snifter. Had to come out of review retirement for this one.
This beer is amazing! It's a yellow to orange hazy brew. looks a lot like fresh squeezed orange juice. You can really smell the citrusy hops & sweetness of the malts! It almost feels like a thick shake in your mouth as you get hit with nice fruity & citrusy hops. It's a very sweet brew that I would drink again & again!
A. Gold colored and very cloudy. More Cloudy than any other DIPA I've seen. Spotty head and nice lacing. 
"Beautiful beer. Pours a bright turbid straw yellow to orange. Thick bright white head on heavy pour. Nose is sherbet like. Orange peel and juice. Taste of citrus. Notes of orange, grapefruit peel, lemon zest and peaches. Honestly one dimensional as in I really only get those citrus notes. But they are huge! And delicious. Creamy silky body that’s easy on the tounge. Hoppy finish to close out this beer. Ya no kidding right? 8lbs per barrel so it better finish hoppy ;)"
"Looks perfect, gold hazy body that has a nice thick, creamy feel and light bitterness. Nose is fruity, taste is juicy as you would expect just from looking at it. One of the few that live up to the hype."
"Came across this one purely by chance recently, and was pretty excited to dig in..."
"Simple put this beer is perfection. Rich, creamy, smooth while bursting with tropical juice goodness. The balance is perfect which is what separates the truly elite beers above the rest. Wish is was available all the time...."
The Gold Standard Gulf Coast IPA
"Absurdly opaque yellow-tan with a minimal, bubbly white blanket."
"12oz bottle with a date that's hard to read but it's there and i'm pretty sure it says ""Manifested on 9-18-18"" (or something close)."
"merky af, sludge status. bright white head is fluffy and leaves some nice lace. pleasant aromas of lemon, grapefruit, mango, dankness, pine. palate follows with a candied fruit melange up front - peaches, orange, mango, grapefruit coming to mind. bitterness provided by grapefruity and piney bitterness on the back end, some herbaceous danky notes. the mouthfeel is thick, pretty fluffy but borderline chalkyness as it warms."
A - Opaque medium orange gold color with very little lacing and no carbonation.
Fresh bottle poured into flute.
"Had this one days after the release but just realized I didn't review it. Easees enough, for my preferences it was perfect in every way."
One of the best hoppy beers I have ever had. It is sticky and so citra forward that it crushes your palate. I can't tell you how awesome this beer is.
"Bottled 9/14/18, enjoyed on 10/5/18. Color is a beautiful, milky yellow that I couldn't see through if I tried. Aroma is fairly mild, but pleasant. Taste is Citra with gusto, delivered with excellent body. Fantastic beer."
"Pours an opaque yellow color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is vert tropical, lots of mango and peach aromas along with pine and spice. The taste of the beer is creamy yet hoppy, not overly bitter but juicy. The feel is smooth and again creamy. Overall it's an excellent IPA!"
"The beer pours a murky yellow with a thin white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of mango, orange, citrus, and papaya. It tastes of mango, orange pith, citrus, and papaya. The feel is medium full. A great IPA from Parish."
"L - 1/2 finger offwhite head is stubborn and refuses to budge. Body is a near-opaque, milky yellow."
Huge thank to JBowenGeorgia for this
Very cloudy straw color with slight head. Aroma is a very pleasant mild citrus with very little hoppyness. Taste is also a very pleasant citrus without any bitterness.
Appearance: grapefruit juice mixed with chalk. This reminds me of cloudy groundwater discharge from a cave or mine tailings. Hazy; totally opaque. Very fine white bubbles form a minimal head that fades quickly to nothing. 
Can’t really say anything other than Andrew is crushing it! Sooo juicy! Thanks Jerry!
Current favorite of the NEIPA style. Citra hop bomb that you can smell across the room. Taste equally explosive but without bite or fusel alcohol that comes with some of these double/triple dry hopped IPAs. “Gooey” mouthfeel would impress even if this were a BA stout
"Look: Straight Pineapple Juice. A glowing milky golden yellow, with full on Haze, creamy one finger of white head. Not to fluffy, the head disappears fast. Some glass lacing when you swirl the beer. It is a great looking beer! "
"Appearance - Pours very bright deep murky yellow, not much but a thin white head spotty lacing around the glass."
"Amazing. Completely opaque milky golden appearance, and an off white sticky head filled with citrus notes to the nose and palate. Big juicy grapefruit nose and flavor, and incredible full and prickly mouth feel. Oh those hops!"
"The epitome of a double, hazy, and juicy IPA. I do not see anywhere that this beer can be improved upon. DDH Ghost in the Machine is one of the best, most well rounded beers that I have ever had."
Another great beer from Parish! Killing it with the new england style from the little town of Broussard la. 
L: Milky apricot and cantaloupe hues with a thin foamy head and moderate lacing; you can see the haze through the brown bottle
"Holy sweet lord. This beer is outrageous. It looks like pure milk from the bottle. Completely opaque. Pours like an Orange Julius. Thick, pale orange. "
Bottled 12/6/17; drank 12/18/17 @ the Yarchives. 
Double Dry-Hopped Ghost in the Machine (Bottled on 12-6-2017)
"Opaque yellow orange with white bubbly head. Citrusy Hops jump from the glass. So damn flavorful, big citrus and dank weediness with bone dry finish. Definitely one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. Incredible brew!"
Truly amazing brew!!! Parish hit it out of the park one again!!!
Easily one the the best DDH- IPAs Ive had. 
"04/2014 - Oooh, that Citra mustiness, plus citrus, hops up front; chewy, flavorful mouthfeel, clean too; so fucking good and by far my favorite solo Citra hopped beer out there!"
Serving: Can
A: Pours the usual dark-ish super hazy yellow color. The head is pure white and looks very creamy. Retention and lacing are pretty good. The look of the beer is 100% NEIPA.
Appearance is a nice amber with a slight white head. Aroma is a strong citrus with a tough of hops. The taste is also a fairly strong citrus with a touch of hops.
Appearance - Pours cloudy yellow with nice thin white cap that settles to a thick ring around the glass. Nice sheets of lacing down the glass.
This may be the best Hill Farmstead I’ve had. This one pulls off all the bells and whistles of a great DIPA.
"Had a brewery and brought grower home, poured growler in pint glass. "
"Canned 1/22/18, Enjoyed 2/14/18 poured into a snifter. Acquired in a ship trade for some stouts."
"From the tap, in a flight glass, yellow in color, hazy in clarity, tropical citrus on the palette"
750 ml growler
This was absolutely great. There's a difference from Citra to Citra. Hill Farmstead sourced the absolute best Citra hops and this has the same perfect balance that you get from most HF IPAs
Canned 1/22/18 Drink by 3/5/18 12 oz. 
Pouring a cold 12 oz can into a snifter. the beer is part of a recent trade with my friend Craig. Thanks!
"Had on tap at my favorite VT bar, Blackback in waterbury. Everything outside of the taste is completely stunning, and the taste is damn good too. The smell is full of rich hops, juicy citrus, especially lemon and grapefruit, floral, herbal, and savory notes. It pours a beautiful haze with a finger of foam, that laces beautifully down the glass. Feels rich and full in the body. Taste is impressive, with citra driving the rest of the many supporting flavors. Wow"
Too Boozy for me and don't get the true citra taste found in much lower ABV citra beers.
Hill Farmstead is my personal favorite of all of them.
"A masterpiece feature of the citra hop, now sold in cans. Was thrilled to bring a bunch of this back home with me. Soft feel, dank citra, clean finish, hard to believe at times that it was 8%."
"Tasted from draft. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice white head. Phenomenal nose. Aroma is grapefruit, lemon, pineapple and a little orange. Taste is moderately bitter with a nice malt backbone. A little more bitterness on this then some of the other Hill Farmstead IPAs as well as not as creamy a mouthfeel as some. Flavors of citrus and tropical fruits with some pine and cracker malt notes. Definitely one of the best imperial IPAs I've had."
Not a fan of this one.
Look is full on hazy dirty peach color with nice white head.
One of my favourite from HF
On-draught @ my favourite bar in NYC.
On-tap @ As Is in NYC. Notes from 3/22/2017.
"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 750 ml swing top growler into signature tulip glass, best before 3/25/2017. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Awesome webby soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange zest, light pine, honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange zest, light pine, honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange peel, light pine, honey, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Slight dryness from lingering bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and lightly silky/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Slight resin/rinds near the end of the glass. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is a world class DIPA! All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, thanks to the smooth/mellow bitterness. Super dank, juicy, and vibrant on hop flavors; great malt balance without feeling sweet or heavy for the ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering."
Look: typical hill farmstead golden look
Got the growler back home and pours into a golden colored liquid with nice fluffy two finger breadth head. It is so smooth for a double IPAA. Very gentle lemon rind flavors along with loads of citrus scents. Truly a remarkable DIPA
On tap at Mule Bar in Winooski.
On tap at Armsby Abbey
"Hazy golden body with a foamy white head. Aroma is big and citrusy, grassy with hints of tropical fruits. Flavor is big and juicy with huge citrus. Feel is smooth, medium bodied and very drinkable. Really awesome DIPA that showcases citra."
My favorite HF hoppy beer!
"Pours a hazy, almost milky, pale yellow with a rich frothy two finger head that slowly dies down. Very nice lacing."

Had it at the armsby abbey- where else! Hill Farmstead has figured out something that the rest of the breweries haven't- so simple yet so good.
Unbelievably smooth and tasty IPA. Can't believe it's not in the top 50
On tap at Rattle n Hum. 
"Excellent beer from hill. Heavy citra hop taste. Great carbonation, slightly hazy. Liked about the same as double galaxy but not as much as Abner or S&S 5."
"Pours an extremely hazy golden orange color. Cannot see through it at all. Very nice, fluffy white head. Aroma is very familiar. Mostly citrus fruits. Tangerines and oranges. Not overwhelming aroma, but solid nonetheless. Smells very similar to many other citra hopped beers. Taste is citrus as expected with a touch (a very slight touch) of dankness. Goes down easy as none of the flavors overwhelm. There is just enough to let you know it's a highly hopped beer without destroying your palette. I'm not getting any bitterness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium and soft. Pretty much perfect as always from Hill Farmstead. This is a very good beer, but I think it's just a tick below the other great HF IPA's and IIPA's that I've tried."
On tap at Torst.
"Big, thick, smooth- typical facts about a HillFarm beer. This one tastes like bad orange juice. is that a thing? it tastes like oranges that were juiced too young to be juiced and are a little too tart and not juicy enough. The orange flavor is the most pronounced orange flavor I've had in an IPA."
"Draught @ Armsby Abby: This one poured a hazy orangish golden color. There was a small off-white head that left a little lacing. Really nice nose. Citrus and tropical notes. The taste is very good. Citrus, some tropical flavors, subdued bitterness, a touch of tartness and a bit of dryness in the finish. Incredibly smooth. Very nice."
Growler poured into a snifter.
Old school meets new school. Grapefruit and tangerine juice meets bitter pith and pine. Sweet fruity front end. Bitter finish. Full body with that creamy HF mouthfeel.
"Never knew citra hopped beers could be this good. Double citra looks like the standard HF beer, turbid, yellow-orange colored with a nice white head. However the aroma is of candied citrus fruit and honeyed grains."
"Like a floating, cloudy orange orb, with a large, fluffy head leaving a thick, creamy blanket and tons of wavy lace."
On tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury. Served in a tulip glass:
Favorites
One of the best Citra hopped IPAs I've had. An explosion of Citra aromas with excellent Citra flavors to back up the aromas. Very clean finish on the beer as well. Loved it
great great great great. why do all of these north vermont ipas have this similar superior taste? must be the water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Poured from a growler into a taster. Huge citra in the nose and taste. One of the most pronounced citra tasting beers I have had the opportunity to try. Beautiful beer.
"Double Citra is a beautifully bright yellow-orange with foamy two finger head out of a 3 day old, 750 mL growler. This hazy beer leaves huge lacing throughout the glass. Has great complexity of grapefruit bitterness and pine with soft mouthfeel that is reminiscent of Maine's Dinner. Another great balanced beer from Hill Farmstead worth picking up when available."
"Clouded apricot-cantaloupe orange. Snow white head, good lacing. "
"Didn't take notes, but it was great. I think I liked Abner better."
750 growler poured into tulip glass. Little over a week old. 
"Growler fill poured into a HF bulb glass. The color is a yellowish-orange with a decent amount of cloudiness. The pour formed a small amount of white, fluffy head. There is substantial lacing as you get through the glass. The aroma is awesome; smell of ripe citrus juiciness. Sort of reminded me of Tree House Juice Machine. The taste is definitely juicy with tangerine, orange, mandarins, mango and other citrus fruits. There isn't much alcohol evident with this one. Medium body and low carbonation. Mouth feel is definitely smooth. Overall, there aren't many beers that are better than this in my opinion. This is an excellent beer and an amazing example of how the citra hop should be utilized. Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful hazy, light orange. Pungent orange and grapefruit on the nose and taste. Super clean and dry, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. So good."
Another quality DIPA from VT. Did I enjoy this one as much as Heady/2nd Fiddle - not quite but still very - very tasty. Nice fruity flavor. While I haven't been blown away by HF like some others I've also never been let down. Every brew has been very good. Cheers
Wow. Amazing hop presence and citrus flavor. An amazing beer.
"OMG was this ever a surprise. I'd never heard of Citra, much less double citra and I am at HF for the first time and it's on draft. So I, dutifully, try to figure out what my draft selections are going to be and that happened to be one of them. Freekin' amazing. So amazing a wound up getting a 64 growler and shared it with some friends (it solidified my friendships even more) and just enjoyed an amazingly great beer. Please don't stop making this one!!!!!!!"
This is everything I want in a hoppy beer- haze color for days... the smell is huge citrus - the taste is amazing.. reminds me of MBC Dinner... just orange and grapefruit for days... mouthfeel is perfect.. wouldnt change a thing
"I drank this at work with a couple kids and didn't take notes, but its in my possible favorite and best beer ever category. best expression of a single hop iv come across yet. upon popping the growler the room was instantly filled with its scent. anyways the complexity, intensity of flavor, drinkability and over deliciousness of this beer is pretty unrivaled. thats all i hafta say"
750ml growler filled three days ago.
On tap and in a snifter. Pours a golden haze with a nice fluffy head inch and a half head. Very fragrant citrus bouquet followed by a nice tropical taste with emphasis on grapefruit. A really nice blend of sweetness and bitterness in a very clean and refreshing finish. The only downside to this beer is running out.
"First beer enjoyed on tap at Dark Lord Day '15. Could've taken it in an IV, it was that good."
"On tap at BBD's 10/3/15. Hazy peach pour with a thin white head. Great citrus aroma, taste is typical Citra flavor, just amped up. Great mouthfeel, slightly bitter finish."
"On tap at Mission Dolores (Brooklyn,NY)"
"Wow. I knew I would probably love this given that Citra is my favorite hop and I love the handful of HF IPAs/APAs/DIPAs that I have had. However, the 3 times I had this in the past 2-3 weeks (on tap at the Jeffrey and at Milk and Hops in NYC, and from a 32oz HF growler picked up and sent to me by SDRedDevil) it was so delicious that I literally had to force myself to not just drink the whole thing in one sip. So delicious and nice dry finish with just the slightest bit of hop bitterness on the back end that just makes you want to take another sip right away before you even put your glass down. Definitely one of the handful of beers I can honestly say that I wouldn't mind if I could only drink that and no other beer for the rest of my life. Definitely the best hope beer from HF of the handful I have had (Edward, Susan, Harlan, Abner, S&S 4), there really isn't anything I would really change about it!"
"I enjoyed this on tap at The Reservoir in Waterbury VT, served chilled in a tulip type snifter."
It's easy to understand why Hill Farmstead is one of the best breweries out there
"This beer pours a beautiful hazy honey color, murky and unfiltered, can already tell this is gonna be full of flavor. The smell is pretty spot on for what you would expect from something named double citra. Tons of citrus on the nose, lemon, orange, grapefruit, kumquat, lots mores, just a juicy smelly beer. The taste doesn't disappoint either. You get hit with a wave of citrus, sweet orange, slight lemon, some tropical fruit, maybe slight sour apple, can't really put a descriptor to it, but man oh man the citrus here is amazing. A nice breads malt balances the flavors perfectly, making for a beautifully balanced beer. My only complaint is slight, but I definitely think the use of citra as a bittering hop is a bit fruitless, leaving some bitterness on the table, but for single hop citra, they squeezed out some decent bitterness. The mouth feel, as you would expect, is fantastic. Creamy, mouth coating, almost like a cloud in your mouth, and goes down so smooth. Like your drinking a fresh squeezed orange juice. This is my first HF brew, and the hype makes sense now. Not the best hoppy beer ive ever had, but easily in the top 10."
"This stands as my all time favorite beer. For my tastes, it is a perfect DIPA. The color, oh man the color. As most HF hops, this has an amazing hazy body that is so bright. Nice fluffy head that lasts and lasts. The smell on this beer is out of this world! First sip is an explosion of citrus, orange peel, grapefruit. Nice hop character follows through and just keeps you coming back for more. The body mirrors its appearance and it has a great mouthfeel. I had massive expectations for this beer when I made the trip and it surpassed them. Truly an exceptional beer and a must try bucket list type of beer for everyone. Incredible!"
"A beautiful beer. Light yellow / orange with a creamy white head that rises slowly and sustains. Smell completely avoids the pungent / dank / catty side of Citra for a soft citrus melange (clementine, kumquat, meyer lemon) and slightly leafy (like crushing the leaves of a citrus tree) note. Biscuity malt is present, not simply hop water, but with such an incredibly airy and creamy mouthfeel. Somehow both substantial and light."
"What an amazing beer! Pours a lightest orange hue with white head. Smells of pure citrus . Perfect hop bitterness with just the right amount of malt to balance it out. I could drink this for days, but i settle for this growler this time ."
Excellent citrus taste and very smooth. Awesome refreshing flavor for late summer
"A: a beautiful golden orange color with two fingers of head. S: a citrus fruit bomb. T: so good. Wow, loss of words. Fruity, with a bitter at the end. M: Classic perfect HF mouthfeel to an IPA. Creamy and light. "
"Pours an orange/blonde hue, offwhite/cream finger length head. Smells of mango, peach, and nectarine. Mouth feel is soft with light yet not oppressive bitterness at the end. The bitterness doesn't linger long. The predominant flavor is mangoes, cantaloupe, and canned peaches. Overall, this is probably Hill's most solid IPA. There is nothing objectionable about it and it is very pleasant. It is one that I always enjoy but have never been blown away by."
This was a great brew. Citra is not completely my thing but could drink this all day and night. there are a lot more hop varietals I would prefer but this one did the trick for sure! worth seeking and worth destroying!!
One of my personal faces from HFS. Multiple times in a growler right from Greensboro!
"Enjoyed this out of a 750 mL swingtop ""growler"" courtesy of BA wuntrikpony. Bottle was filled 9/3 and is adorned with a tag marked ""enjoy by 9/11/15""--lucky me, as it is 9/11 as I set to consume this. Very happy to get my hands on it, as I've not had any of HF's ""hoppy"" beers before and I do love me some Citra hops. Poured into a Speigelau IPA-specific glass."
Smooth citrus goodness. Looks elsewhere for indepth analysis. This just tastes and smells so good. Hops are present but not overpowering. One of the best.
"Pours cloudy hazy orange with a two finger head. Aroma is pine and hops with some tropical citrus. Taste is of strong pine and hoppy bitterness with some real present sweetness. The citrus is there, but it's a little muted from the citra hops. Finish is bold and bitter. Overall another great showing from Hill Farmstead."
"Such a great brew, slightly melon, citra hops are prevalent, excellent balance though, light maltyness and a bit on the dry side. Only got one growler maybe should have gotten more. Hopefully it's available again soon!"
"Melon goodness. Citra hops are on full display with only a slight honey-like malt backing. The hops are the star here, and HF is able to put them front and center on an amazingly drinkable platform for a 8% DIPA."
"Rarely does a beer grace the lips in the dominant showcase of a single hop variety as well as the ""Citra"" hop variety has done in the capable hands of Hill Farmstead. The nearly teeth-churning fruit flavors on display to seduce the senses and refresh the palate with the intangibles that go far beyond what's expected of imperial IPA."
"On tap. Pours a hazy, glowy orange color. Thin, off white head. Aroma is very tropical. Citra nose through and through. Nose isn't quite as intense as some other top-tier Imperial IPAs but the overall aroma is definitely attractive. The flavor of the hops is a mixture of several tropical fruits and some musty/stemmy hoppiness. Malt is semi-sweet, pale and bready. Citra hops are marvelous. Very drinkable. Not overly bitter. Flavor and aroma are great but a little less potent and pungent than I was expecting. I would still crush this if it was available to me. A long time want; just slightly below my lofty expectations."
"Wow great looking and tasting beer. We had a couple of the Hills today and this was the winner. Beautiful glow in the glass and wonderful fruity notes of guava, tangerines, and a nice piney flavor on the back end. Get it!!"
Probably the best beer I've ever had. Better than Heady Topper in my opinion.
"Poured from a fresh growler into an Hill Farmstead over-sized wine glass. a hazy orange and slightly peach body, with great white lacing."
Growler from the brewery poured into a snifter tasting glass.
Poured from a 2L growler the day after it was filled.
"Pours a hazy yellow straw color. The smell is loaded with bright citrus flavors, pineapple, mango, hay. The taste follows the nose. this is a fruits hop bomb of an IPA. Loved it."
On tap at and Hill Farmstead.
"Of what I've had thus far, this is my favorite of Hill Farmstead's IPAs. Got it a couple times on tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA.Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a creamy white head. Lots of lacing down the glass. Nose and taste are a cavalcade of citrusy goodness; nice notes of tropical fruits as well: guava, mango, pineapple. This one is just so damn good, and the light mouthfeel makes it so tremendously easy to guzzle. Love it!"
Just amazing...this is my favorite beer and favorite brewery!
My first ever HF brew. I think I picked a good one!
Had me at the smell
"Wow, smooth is an understatement"
This is the epitome of a DIPA. Deep and luscious citrus that is probably the best expression of Citra hops that I've had. But what really sets this one apart is its luxurious creaminess. The mouthfeel is just perfect.
have had this tons of times. amazing double ipa. super citric super dank. everything about ipa is this beer.
Absolutely amazing. Worth every bit of hype.
"out fu....ing standing beer, great job Shaun and team...again"
"Tastes like candied grapefruit/pineapple. Just so smooth and intoxicating. Where's the double IPA alcohol? so smooth and balanced, one of the best DIPAs out there, everybody knows this but it is definitely worthy of any and all hype. Juicy as hell and still has that perfect bitter bite at the end to fulfill all IPA desires. damn son! This is absolutely in my tap list in heaven."
"Look is amazing, hazy with a fluffy white head. Almost seems to glow from inside. "
Acquired at the brewery 5/16/15.
750ml swing top growler poured into Spiegelau tulip.
"Look: Beautifully hazy shade of pale gold. Decent white head, lots of lacing"
Many thanks to Raveskdr for the hook up. My man!
I got this from Hopasouras who was on a business trip up in the NE and I could hardly believe what was in front of me. If only this was available across the US everyone could enjoy the majesty of this brew.
Extremely good!!! Had in a 750 Growler sent to me by a trading friend and it did not disappoint!! Only thing better would have been having it out of the tap a week earlier! Lots of Citra hops on the nose and palate.
Received a 2 liter growler in a trade that was about 10 days old. I drank the growler by myself in a 48 hour period (didn't want it to go flat) so I definitely became familiar with this beer. 
From a 750 into a HotD tulip. This growler is 10+ days old so there is that. That being said it pours a dark orange hue with a beautiful two finger head. And it smells fantastic.
"Poured from a growler. Light in color, great head retention. Found the taste very sweet for an IPA but I really enjoyed that aspect. Solid beer from HF overall"
"I finally got to try this and my meager descriptive abilities do not do it justice. As another said, ""Does it live up to the hype? Yes! Period."" No, exclamation point! Period."
From Notes:
My first Hill Farmstead IPA experience. Will it live up to the hype?
Unbelievably sweet and hoppy. Flavors are completely balanced and crazy delicious.
"Poured from a 750mL bomber into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass, purchased at the brewery a few days ago, enjoy by 12Feb15! Tasted at the brewery but psyched to rate. "
"This DIPA has as it all going on: luscious appearance, complex nose, big flavors that remain enjoyable over a session coupled with a light and effervescent mouthfeel. The restrained brewing technique HF embodies lends itself well to their 'stronger' offerings, and Double Citra is no exception."
Oman! I'm sucking the taste off my tongue..
"From a growler. Not sure if the growler just had issues, but this just was a supreme disappointment."
"Simply one of the best beers I have ever had. The light cloudy color, nose and taste are all top rate. Waited a long time to get my hands on some growlers of this and it is easy to see why it is in high demand. Exceptional beer from an exceptional brewer."
The beer comes in a signature hazy golden light orange.
Picked up a 750ml yesterday and it didn't even make it home to CT. Juicy and dank. Love it
"If you love citra hops, you will absolutely love this beer. Big and juicy, great nose, and immensely drinkable. Another world class DIPA from Shaun Hill."
"On tap at Beachwood Brewing in Long Beach, CA."
"Many thanks to baybum who schlepped this thing across many county lines to get it to MN. 750ML growler best by 10/31/14, so I still have 96 minutes. I better get to it. Split with my lovely wife. "
"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled about 5 hours ago"
Split with angrybabboon.
"Nose of orange, lemon zest and hint of alochol. A scent of freshness tells me: stop smelling and drink!"
Filled about a week ago. Teku glass.
This is about as good as it gets on the palate when the right batch hits. 
"A darker shade of yellow in color. Cloudiness gives it a pastel appearance. Forms a moderately sized, fluffy white head. Head is quite stable. Lots of patchy lacing on the way down. Aroma is pungent - I could smell the ripe citrus juiciness as I was pouring the beer. Aroma is intensely citrusy. Juicy tangerine and orange blossom. The taste is more of the same. There is a mild sweetness to the beer that complements the juicy citrus. Tropical fruits, mandarin, and mango. Finishes with a touch of earthiness and an uplifting hint of alcohol. Medium bodied. Moderate bitterness. Lower carbonation gives this an extra smooth mouthfeel. "
"Hate to give perfect scores, but it is the perfect beer-- smooth, creamy, tropical fruits, citrus, I swear I get cherry, hoppy goodness, just the right amount of bitterness, perfectly balanced...."
Amazing Hill Farmstead IPA. Take your favorite HF or North East IPA and add tons of Citra on the nose and taste. This is a premier beer that everyone should try.
Growler shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Hoppy nose. Pine and floral hop notes. A little on the minerally side. Slightly unbalanced.. Original rating 4.0
Poured from a fresh growler into a modified tulip glass.

"This is my favorite beer I have ever had, I would take this over a Heady Topper or Double Sunshine or any other IIPA on the planet any day of the week. This beer is leaps a bounds more than the others for me, it is perfect to me in every way I can think."
"A: Pretty light hazy yellow, thin white foamy head"
Really nice work on the citra. 
Poor was great with nice foamy head
"Big off white head fades quick and is remembered only by the lacing it leaves. Bright notes of orange and mango hit hard in the aroma. Taste follows, orange, mango, tropical, slightly floral on the finish. Nice hefty medium mouthfeel feels low on carbonation. Overall a world glass DIPA that's slightly one dimensional but does it well."
Got in an awesome trade with Seblp - big thanks!
Growler purchased at HF on 05Apr2014 and consumed on 10Apr2014. Served at ~45F in a stemmed HF glass.

"750ml growler, shared courtesy of Dustin. Also had a taste of this at the Beer Temple in Chicago, IL, both times in early November 2013."
"Pours a hazy golden straw yellow with an inch, off-white head. Plenty of lacing around the glass. It looks magnificent. Smells of strong citrus fruits (I.e., grapefruit) as well as a piney resin aroma. It tastes of strong citrus fruits and piney, earthy flavors. Bitter up front and lingers for a bit. Medium bodied, goes down smooth. Very excellent offering from HF!"
Poured from a growler filled 2 days ago in a Kuhnhenn tulip.
"Pour is hazed golden yellow with a fairly tight white head. Nose has a light grain up front with grapefruit and citrus, faint pine and a touch herbal. Taste is fruitier and the citra is much more pronounced. Lots of tropical fruits and mango finishing with some lightly bitter grapefruit and notes of hop resin. Body is a bit fuller and softer carbonation. Soft and a touch grainy."
"This is one of the most beautiful beers I've ever consumed. It absolutely glows in the glass. The concentration of hops hits you hard at first, but once you acclimate this is perhaps the best IPA I've have encountered. Tons of various citrus notes, smooth drinking without any of the overt or longstanding bitterness that many of the great IPAs demonstrate. If I resided anywhere near the brewery this beer would turn me into the town drunk."
Poured from a growler into a Willibecher glass. This was filled 4 days ago at the brewery.
750 ml growler filled at Hill Farmstead. Poured into a HF stemmed glass.

Hill Farmstead Double Citra
"750ml growler poured into a snifter, generously shared by Colin, Mike and Chris! Review from iPhone notes."
"Look: Color is yellowish orange. Very cloudy, white head that fades fast and some lacing"
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
From 11/01/13 notes. Huge thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing a growler of this with me; thanks Ross! Big want. Poured into a Bell's tulip.
750 ml growler filled at Hill Farmstead. Consumed same day (11/2). Poured into a HF stemmed glass.
"Beautiful golden pour, with a thin head (&lt; 1/2 finger), solid retention, and nice fuzzy lacing. Beer is cloudy and opaque."
"750ml growler poured into a oversized wine glass. Poured a hazy orangey amber, reminded me of a shandy or radler freshly made. Aroma was slightly citrusy, with a bit of sharp pine hoppy. Not over powering, or underwhelming, nicely balanced. Flavor was hop up front, with the undertones of citrus. Plenty of hop of front, but the citrus kept it from being too much one note. Nice and tingly in the mouth, coated well, and not overly chewy. Overall a great beer. Plenty of hoppy flavor without being a hop bomb, and the citrus flavor worked nicely as well."
Second of two growlers in the last two weeks.
Picked this up from the brewery yesterday. Enjoyed the taster they offered so I picked up a couple growlers. Review is from the growler.
Serving Type: Poured into a tulip glass from a 2L growler filled yesterday and stored over night in the refrigerator.
A- Pours a very light golden straw color with orange hues and a medium sized white head that leaves some lacing. 
"Tap at Capone’s and Eulogy for RBSG 2011. The pour is a cloudy, glowing, yellow with a whipped cream, bright white head. Nose is fresh kumquat and creamsickle with orange sherbet. Taste is full sweet melons with peach, kumquat, sweet grapefruit, Valencia orange, even getting a little meaty like durian and jackfruit. Palate is wildly soft, nearing that ridiculously fluffy softness in FFF Apocalypse Cow. Overall, it could be mistaken for pineapple milkshake. This is how DIPA should be. Just delete all those cheesy, syrupy, sticky, red and brown and orange DIPAs that have taken over the world and replace them with either Hill Farmstead Double Citra or FFF Apocalypse Cow. Then I might not hate DIPAs anymore."
A - Hazy orange with pineapple accents. Nice foamy head to it
Beer pours hazy golden with some beautiful frothy head on top which falls down to a nice sticky lacing. No qualms here. A beautiful beer.
750 growler poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
"Pours a very hazy, sunny orange color. Fluffy bone white head leaves lots of frothy lace. Aroma is...citra, citra and more citra. Some orange peel, faint malt sweetness, backing tropical fruitiness. Fast is citrus, with orange and pineapple, hint of pine and lightly sweet. Smooth feel, full bodied, very drinkable. "
Growler from the brewery filled May 3 and Consumed May 5. From notes.
Pours that nice beautiful hazy orange I've come to expect in HF DIPAs with a sticky white head leaving a nice lattice work of lace around the glass. 
750 mL growler poured into a Teku snifter.
"Okay, this is Vermont, and the level of quality craftsmanship and legend is drawing folks from all over the United States that are touring ""Beer Country"" as if it were a serious California Wine Country tour, and WHY NOT?! "
"First impression into the glass is a huge overwhelming smell of citra hops. Smells very tropical with mango and pineapple notes. Pours a pale dirty orange which is also pretty cloudy. In the mouth it its the perfect level of hops and isn't overwhelming at all. Not too sweet like the smell would lead you to believe. Super smooth finish. The mouthfeel is tremendously satisfying. Perfect combination of bitterness, carbonation, and freshness. Outstanding specimen."
I received this from JSBILK in a trade -- thanks Justin! He got this 750 ml growler filled about two weeks ago. Poured from the growler into my tulip glass.
"This poured out as a hazy golden color with a thin white head on top. The retention is thin and some bubbly lacing on the glass. The smell is good but not as great as I was hoping. The nose is slightly fruity citrus on the nose. The taste is big with hops, nice bitter lemon flavors. Some subtle malt in the finish. The mouthfeel is very drinkable, smooth and juicy. Overall this is really good but not as good as some of the HF IPA's."
A: Had at Dark Lord Day out of a BCS snifter. Great orange color. Bubbly and very inviting.
Growler
"Pours very cloudy yellow, several inches of bubbly white head, very typical HF IPA."
750ml growler filled just under a week ago and refrigerated the entire time. Thanks Don (Donfrap) for bringing this back for me. Reviewed live.
Drank from a 2 liter Hill Farmstead growler
Just tried this brew for the second time at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbury. All around one of the best DIPAs I have ever and I STRONGLY recommend another great beer from HF. Not surprisingly the Citra smell hits you right off the bat with grapefruit and sticky sweet orange- some other tropical fruit as well make their way to the nose. Well again not surprising that the citra flavor comes through like a train- the slight bitterness and tartness of the grapefruit is perfectly balanced with the sweet orange. Not too much malty flavor but it comes through in the faint background. I get the bitterness that I would expect. however its not at all overbearing-might help to mask the 8+% booze. Hop character lingers in the best way possible.
"Reviewing Double Citra from the Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro Bend, Vermont."
Reviewed from notes after hooking JLindros up with a growler. Finally getting around to adding all my beers. Poured into a Kate the Great tulip.
"On tap at HF anniversary (1st). Hazy yellow pour, white foam, heavy lacing. Delicious citra aroma, fresh lemonade, resinous hop smells and a touch of honey. Taste is hoppy, lots of , lemon flavours with a bitter finish. Very refreshing palate, my favourite IIPA from HF thus far, I can't wait to try it again as I've missed it this year."

Pours cloudy gold with a finger of creamy white head with good retention and lacing.
"On tap @ Capone's in Norristown PA (5.5oz pour). Glad I was able to try this one - somehow it lasted on tap for 5 days, and today was the first day I could get over there."
"citra hop has always been the one I go to for my ipa fix. after my one and only kern citra broke open on the floor of my apartment I feel the need to review. Poured into my HF stemware, the brew pours an amazing .5 inch head with a light golden hue. the aromas of hop and pine enlighten me. after enjoying hotd matt two hours earlier which the gf simply said elll no, she smelled double citra and said mmm delic. my first and possible only real rating"

"First had: on tap at Teresa's, Wayne, PA"
A - Extremely hazy gold approaching amber. Moderate carbonation with a white head that fades rapidly to a coating.
Swing-top growler filled exactly one week ago.
"This beer is a beauty. Pours a golden orange with nice lacing. You can immediately smell the citra hops as soon as you begin pouring. Light but refreshing carbonation with a sweet, citrusy start that mellows to a bitter, well-rounded finish. Hits all the right notes but none of them too hard. "
A-hazy golden color with a nice white head and good lacing
A - Pours a hazy orange with a nice amount of head.

Another fresh 750ml growler sent by the generous RSchaeffer. This one set a new standard.
Big Thanks to BearsonAcid for picking this up for me yesterday. Just picked it up from him about an hour ago and I’m already sitting enjoying it in front of some football.
Presentation: Split a 64 oz. growler of this with a friend. Served chilled directly into pint glasses. Got this filled on Saturday at the Brewery.
Review #15
Double Citra
crazy how many double ipas does this brewery have? answer: you can never have enough double ipas haha
Thanks to Tony for sharing this growler with myself and others.
"I've had this twice, and held off on reviewing it as the first growler was as flat as the Earth circa 1491. Composite of two reviews here - Russian River tulip and plastic cup serving vessels respectively. Thanks to Sean and Eric for sharing."
"Served in a tulip, on tap at Teresa's with one of the sickest IPA lineups I have ever seen. Consumed earlier today, 7/1/2011."
Growler shared by yourefragile. Thanks Mike!
Thanks Andrew for the sample of Hill Farmstead Double Citra 
Growler into a tasting glass. Big thanks to Hopstoopid120 for sharing this one.
"on draft at aurants. pours a murky golden yellow. minimal pine smell but as strong citus, mango and papaya notes. taste is very good. lots of the citrus comes through as do many of the fruit scents noted in the smell. a very big bodyfor an ipa which compliments the flavors and smells."
Growler shared by TurdFurgison at my 30th Birthday Extravaganza. Thanks Eric!
Draft at Eulogy.
"shared by ejyoung, in a parking garage before trivia. "
A - Hazy looking orange beer with a nice white head that left some solid stick and lace on the sides.
"Hazy golden yellow color with a soft white head that retains well. Nice lacing. Nose of oranges, grapefruit and some grain, almost cracker-like. Pleasant, but not particularly aromatic. Taste definitely gives a good presence of orange flesh and tropical fruit. Has a firm bitterness, but not astringent. Some grain comes through as well. It has an interesting blend of almost sweet fruit flavors and then moves into a bitter finish. Medium bodied, sits on the tongue nicely and then finishes nice and dry. I'm a little torn here; I like the beer, it's very well made (no astringency, no alcohol coming through), but even though my score feels honest, it doesn't fully paint the picture. I'll have to revisit this beer if I'm lucky enough to do so. I'm still very excited to try anything else (especially IPA's) made by Hill Farmstead; the quality of brewing is there."
Thank you Jenray for hooking me up big time with this tasty treat for my 500th review! You are truly queen of the hops!
Growler sent to me by SneezyAchew. Thanks Michael! Split with ipa247. 
Growler thanks to Michael (yourefragile). Awesome to get to try another Hill Farmstead beer!
On tap at Blind Tiger IPA event.
2L growler poured into a cigar city snifter.
"After having this several times on tap and in a few growlers, I think I've got enough experience under my belt for a review. Super-delicious brew. Notes were taken from a growler. Served in a Hill Farmstead long-stem tulip."
"12 oz snifter at Pinocchio’s in Media. This poured a cloudy golden orange with a finger-and-a-half, off-white head which settled to a coating. Lacing was spotty. Nose was citrus, especially orange and grapefruit, and pine with a slight alcohol back. Taste includes the citrus, of course, but there is a strong caramel malt presence as well. The finish is dry and bitter with little hint of the 8% alcohol. Body was slick, medium with moderate carbonation for a DIPA. This is a very drinkable and I would not hesitate to go for it again."
6/9/2011
"Thanks to Thorpe for this growler... pours a dark murky honey gold, opened without a hiss, not much carbonation, a light tan watery head, not looking good but I can’t knock it... muted nose of citra with malt, more malty than anything, I thought this would be a citra bomb, surprised... the taste is also just a malt bomb with a citra finish... easy to drink but doesn’t really show me a ton"
"Shared by the very generous ejyoung, this was poured from a growler into my Lost Abbey tulip during an impromptu tasting in a parking garage. No venue is off-limits!"
Review #200!! Served on-tap at Capone's during the Hill Farmstead party during Philly Beer Week. Having had the regular version of Citra IPA I was dieing to try this version.
On tap during Philly Beer Week
"Seriously growler side by side with several big IPAs and some boring stouts. Thanks to Mike, Mike, Ben, Jeff, and me for making this whole thing happen. Very awesome afternoon."
On tap at Devil's Den on 6/3/11 during Philly Beer Week for the Bella Vista Rare Beer event.
Had this one during PBW at Capone's....
Growler obtained at Hawthorne's at the PBW event; poured into a Chouffe tulip
on tap at devils den in philly during the bella vista bash
On tap at Capones today.
"HF Double Citra pours a hazy straw color with a two finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Sticky, resinous lace patterns are deposited on the sides of my Hill Farmstead cabernet style tasting glass with each subsequent sip."
On Tap at Capone's during PBW in a little dinky snifter
On tap at capones for the hill farmstead's pbw. Its on mfer's. 
"a great balance of fruit and brisk IPA. just a bit more of an accented american IPA in that is actually seem to be a bit littler in feel then most DIPA. in that its sort of a one stop shop of perfect balance of pine, earthy apple walnut, lemon zest and lavender. there is a sun tea maltiness that screams summer. a balanced bitter with a balance hop aroma and fruit. will make a beer with this hop... i just don't think the grain profile will come through like it has here."
On tap @ my house!! (can't tell ya how but Rochefort10nh knows ;)
Growler filled at the First Anniversary Party. It pours a beautiful hazy orange color that says hoppy DIPA. Small creamy head that leaves light lacing.
"750mL brown glass swing-top ""growler"" filled at their Anniversary Event yesterday. Thanks to Carl (sleepnbballrlife)!"
A: A nice golden yellow with a thin head and nice lacing around the glass. 
"Pours hazy orange, sand-colored head starts at about 2 fingers, retains as an uber-bubbly cap and leaves good lacing."
On tap at Hill Farmstead 1st Anniversary Celebration
"My first Trillium beer, have to figure out how to get more regularly! "
"08/2015 - Typical Trillium juiciness on the nose with orange, tangerine, and some citrus up front; notable onion on the palate with a nice sweetness, creaminess, and slightly bitter back end; the finish is clean, bright, fruity, and a touch dank."
Serving: Can
16oz can dated 8/10/18.
2018 batch - canned 8/10
"Headroom has been a wishlist beer for a couple of years now - as with other Trillium offerings, I've only sporadically been able to nail down trades. We're only talking about IPAs here - but they can still be confoundingly difficult to locate."
Believe the hype!
Canned 5 days ago.
2018 batch
"This beer was fantastic,"
L: beautiful beer. A combination or orange and pineapple juice look. Clear head that goes away. Probably the only drawback. 
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (~1 month old). Smell is a ton of bright/green hop flavor and citrus with notes of orange pulp, pineapple, tropical fruit, resin and oats. "
"This was absolutely incredible. Hops were absolutely incredible, creamy mouthfeel, the aroma just bursts out as soon as I opened the can. Pineapple notes all over."
"It pours the color of Orangina and has a hazy neon glow. Not as opaque and cloudy as some reviews indicate, though. "
L: Cloudy grapefruit juice
L - Orange milkshake with a finger of white head
A 16 oz. can dated 8-11-17 poured into a tulip. 
Can stamped 11-AUG-17
"Tasted from can. Pours a super cloudy yellow orange with white head. Aroma of pineapple, orange, mango, melon and other tropical fruits. Moderate to heavily bitter. Lots of tropical fruits on the flavor with some dank resin. Awesome IPA."
Opaque corn milk yellow with a fizzy micro-bubbled blanket that dies to nothing.
this is delicious....i get it...its a great dipa.... is it light years better than their other offerings? not by the miles that the masses and hype has led it to be...idk that's just my 2 cents....
Poured into a Trillium tulip. 
"Pours a hazy straw color with one finger head. Aroma is dank grapefruit, melon, lime, some tropical fruit, and grassy, herbal hops. Taste is a hop explosion. I haven't had a bitter, dry hop bomb like this in a while so it was a welcome surprise. Prickly hop burn cascades across the palate carrying juicy citrus goodness. This has all the good qualities of aggressive hop character - sour orange juice bite and dank herbal notes. Full mouth feel and medium carb. Well worth the cost to acquire."
"Pours hazy bright yellow in color with minimal head. Taste is grapefruit, lime, and starfruit. Bitter--more than most Trillium beers, slightly juicy, moderate carbonation, and medium heavy bodied. More of a sipper than most Trillium beers. Edge comes off after a week and a half and then the juice stars front and center. Good, but middle of the pack for my Trillium list."
Can from their 8/12 release.
This is very unique and complex for an DIPA. Juicy bomb up from and really great bite of hoops at the end. Changes as it warms with sweet nose and super smooth finish. Great!
Canned exactly one week ago.
Growler filled 8.12.17 and poured into pilsener glass
"pours out a hazed orange-gold color. loose bright white head recedes quickly, leaves a few small patches of lace. aroma and palate offers candied orange, honey mango, peaches and cream, bubblegum, pineapple, berries, ripe melon, lychee, pithy citrus peel, herbaceous notes, spicy plastic dankness, doughy malts, grapefruit, and some mild pine resin on the finish. mouthfeel is medium with some nice texture. excellent excellent stuff!!"
Look: custard. Not entirely attractive as beers go.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.
Not a lot to say. Just an amazing beer that drinks like a champ.
"Turbid, OJ-esque. Par for the DIPA course. Amazing nose, complete with lots of citrus and tropical fruit. The initial taste on the palate is a complete juice bomb - and lovely. Finishes bitter and harsh. Lingering acid burn on the back of the throat. Slightly over-carbonated."
Look: Murky pale gold with an eggshell head. Moderate activity. Looks just like peach juice. 
Canned 8/11/17
Wow Trillium does it again.... Not! This tastes like everything else they make. Honestly this could be DDH X Street just with a new label.
"2017 release happened today. drinking out of a can I just picked up. hoppy smell hits you immediately upon opening the can. has some amazing citrus'y tones. the look is super hazy but more of a light yellow. early and mid taste is fantastic with grapefruit notes. the finish and aftertaste is typical of Trillium beers in that the hoppiness lingers. that would be my only critique of this beer, which is certainly one of my favorite Trillium beers."
"Look: Yellow, hazy, turbid with small head."
Want to crazy about this one I definitely prefer their sour beers.
From notes back in Sept 2016
"This is by far the best IPA from Trillium that I have had by them. It was so juicy and also so smooth. I loved it, smelled great, great head and color."
From my Untappd checkin 9/18.
"Exploding with hops, and has a bit of a bite at then end of the palate."
Ive had the good fortune of tasting this twice recently. Thank you to Mark and Jon for sharing this wonderful beer.
"Some things about this are excellent and some don't sit right with me. The murky color with no head retention or lacing isn't a positive for me. When the color starts veering milky that's not appealing. The aroma is beautiful: mango, ripe and unripe; a pulpy sour orange; dankness that's green and nettle like, brambles and jungle vines. The flavor is too much. The flavor are over-saturated. The mango gets fuzzy, hot and rindy. A sharp spiciness from just too much damn greenery. The feel is a bit flat and prickly. There is such a thing as too many hops. This is it."
"A little different than other Trillium IPAs that I've had. This one had the same look and mouth feel, but the juicy flavor had a heavier Hop bitterness backbone to it. The nose carried that same bitterness backbone as well. Great beer though"
Have had a few of these by now. August 2016 release.
"Hazy and thick, no light comes through. The flavor is very thick also, citrusy (not too much, less orange than grapefruit) with some melon/stonefruit softness. There is a bright and light kick to it at the end, almost makes your mouth tingle a little. Not too bitter, just enough. No alcohol taste."
On draft at Trillium (Canton location).
Super hazy yellow orange. White head wth lace.
Look: The most murky IPA I've ever seen. No light can pass through the force field of Headroom.
Maybe Trillium's best double- still didn't outshine their other beers like it's advertised but kick-ass nonetheless
The best Trillium offering i have had. the Orange flavor is amazing and even better the Julius from TH. The flavor has a nice lime zest bitter finish that is just right from the over whelming orange cream pop body. the nose is pungent orange circus and Citra hops.
Poured from the can into a tulip. Pours murky with minimal head - reminiscent of pineapple juice. Huge tropical fruit on the nose and taste accentuated by a creamy mouthfeel. Worthy of the hype!
Finally tracked down a can of this amazing brew! Looks like straight juice and the hops nose hits you when your face is still a few feet from the glass! Tons of citrusy dank hops goodness here!!!!
fresh 2016 batch can drank on 9/8/2016
"8/17/16 dated can poured into the special release "" Headroom Stemmed / teku-ish"""
Canned 8/17/16. Consumed 9/1/16.
"L: Insanely hazy (bordering on murky) deep burnt orange, honeycomb, and apricot hues with a loose white head that recedes quickly"
One of the best trillium beers to date. Insane amount of hops in this one. I should have waited till the end to have this but couldn't wait. Happy they still had it on tap.
Fresh can poured into flute.
"The most unsettlingly turbid mustardy chartreuse appearance with no head, like fresh pear juice. Taste is overwhelming of liquid hops. Nothing else but hops really."
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. From the release this past Saturday. 4 days old. 
"pours an insane murky yellow, barely any head and dissipates to nothing. smell is HUGE orange, citrus, and grass, no malt on the nose. taste is exactly the same notes as the smell, but intense and even more beautiful. so fresh, so bitter, so green and juicy and everything that every New England IPA wants to be. the feel is the only thing that would have needed any improvement but with a beer that tastes like this, it almost doesn't matter. incredible beer, sad it's only once a year but I will try my very hardest to get it every year going forward (without waiting in line of course). hats off to the guys at Trill, they one upped themselves. it's like an even bigger and better Vicinity."
Poured from the can. Looks like orange juice or mac n cheese. The murkiest of the new england IPAs.
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"This is a tricky one to review. Definitely the haziest beer I've ever seen/had. Looks like condensed grapefruit juice. Very little head on the pour and what little you get goes away to nothing quickly... as in, not a single bubble anywhere in the glass. Smell and taste are massive: tropical fruit then dank/pine then grapefruit pith bitterness... very glad there's some bitterness at the end to balance the tons of fruitiness up front. Very complex. Thankfully there is carbonation in the beer... just no head. I'd say mouthfeel was a bit below average for a Trillium. This would have been maybe the best DIPA ever if there was a little head or lacing and a bit softer but more persistent carbonation for mouthfeel. Definitely glad I bought the limit on this though."
16 oz. can dated 08/17/16
"L - striking. Cracked the can and gazed inside. OJ here we go. Wow, pours a swampy murky turbid pale orange. Almost has a bit of a brownish yeasty hue to it. Reminds me of those frozen orange juice pops we used to make as kids. "
"Can filled 8/17/16 for hop jam, bought this morning."
"2016 version. L: Pours like orange juice and looks like orange juice in the glass. Haze for days, but not disgustingly hazy. It literally just looks like orange juice. Head was bright white but disappeared very, very quickly which was a bit odd. Looks amazing. S: Pineapples, oranges and a hint of dankness. The second I cracked my can open my entire kitchen was filled with the aroma. Insane. T: Taste follows the noise. Intensely hoppy and juicy. There is some bitterness, but it just rolls off the tongue. Unbelievably crushable for 8%, and there's no hint of alcohol flavor. Amazing. F: One of the fullest mouthfeels I've ever experienced on a DIPA. Feels like I could chew it. O: The best DIPA I've ever had, and I've had some monsters. If you can get your hands on this beer, do it. Its lives up to the hype and then some."
"Very retro check in - Trillium needs to get up and brew this one again. Although I wouldn't call it my favorite of their beers, this was another very tasty DIPA."
"Looks like a typical Trillium, full of haze."
"This beer takes hops to an absolute extreme. Completely opaque due to extreme haze here. This does not look like a beer to me. It just looks like a straight up glass of pineapple juice. Delicious hop citrus on the taste, this beer is so thick and hoppy that I'm not sure if I should be drinking it or chewing it. Got some bitterness to balance it out but I don't even taste the slightest presence of malt. Has a bit of a spicy taste on the mid-palate and a tad on back end."
well I had a bottle 5 days old and about 25 days old.
"A: Pours a perfect pale super cloudy yellow, nice big white head but has minimal lacing."
The beer comes in an insane pineapple/fresh squeezed orange juice color. 
"Pours a murky orange-tinted yellow reminiscent of grapefruit juice. Smell like you're standing in an orange grove in the middle of a Nelson Sauvin field. Tastes of citrus and hop oil and pineapple. Sweet up front; nicely balanced bitter finish. Feel is fairly low carb--more like a slightly fizzed juice than beer, but it works for me."
750 ml bottle poured into a tulip
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Trillium Artaic glass (noted so I can show off my cool glassware like the other reviewers on this site):
"I loved this beer and it was hard for me to find fault . Color was amazing , dont know how it could get better . Smell was great and fresh . Taste was everthing i wanted in a hop , galaxy brings the texture mosaic and columbus bringing the strong flavor for me."
750 ml bottle was poured into a snifter.
"L: Super hazy yellow, bright white head"
"A: Cloudy dull yellow looks like straight juice. Thin white, foamy head dissipates into a white soapy lacing."
"Amazing DIPA with some awesome hops. Super juicy with tropical citrus like papaya and guava, with an earthy/dank bitterness. Not overly sweet with a very dry and sharply bitter finish. Finish tastes a little too vegetal for my liking so my rating is a little lower. Overall still outstanding and worth seeking out."
"Had this initially from first leg tapped at Hop Jam on 8/22/15, and was blown away. Same reaction from the bottle tonight. This is uber smooth hop/danky love juice. Trillium is absolutely KILLING it with every IPA and APA they make. Get some!"
From 09/01/15 notes. 750ml bottle into a tulip thanks to BeerLawyer85; thanks a lot Ross!
"wawaweewah!! Maybe my favorite Trillium to date (that says a LOT)..pours a hazy opaque yellow, like a damn juice...pineapple-y mango smell, and tastes of grapefruit juice. Nice bitterness too. Gonna be sad when this bottle is empty, for sure!"
"Holy shit this is an amazing beer. Juicy doesnt even begin to describe it. Fruity, juicy, grapefruity, dank, did I mention juicy? and just plain phenomenal. I've had lots of highly rated DIPAs and this blows the doors off of all of them. Trillium knocked this out of the neighborhood let alone the park, they are straight up hop wizards."
"Sorry, but this is not orange, apricot or peach-- almost grey in color--at least ashen white peach...."
"Now that's a lot of hops. The color is your typical NE IPA cloudy yellow with a good white head. The nose is hops, hops and hops. Smells nice but gives a hint the hops will overpower. And sure enough, the taste of the hops overpowers the beer, having strong bitter bite up front, but it mellows to more of a citrusy/creamier taste. Pulling back the hops or fortifying the base would blend things perfectly, but quite a good IPA as is."
"Pours a pretty off-white orange with a two finger head. Smells like pineapple juice and mango, some dank hops. Taste is a slam of bitterness and hop-forward flavor with the citrus hitting more on the back end. Noticeably more hoppy and intense than a lot of Trillium's other offerings. Peppery and biting mouth feel. Fades into a lingering mouth of hops. The aroma isn't matching the strong Double IPA flavor. Still an excellent beer that's staying more true to IPA roots than the typical gushing tropical fruit nature of Trillium brews. "
"Poured into a tulip glass from a bomber. This beer is a golden straw hue, hazy and opaque. Paler than most Trillium IPAs. The head is white and effervescent, slow to dissipate.The aroma is of oranges, pineapples, and mangoes, accompanied with slight skunky, dank hop fragrance. There is a very faint semblance of tropical fruit but that is quickly complimented by a zesty lime. The finish is bitter and resinous. Slight chalkiness in feel."
Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a snifter.
"Oh, damn. Get your hands on this beer if you can. Peaches, pineapple. Orange. Citrus and tropical notes are banging in this brew. Nice soapy head. Mouthfeel is coating."
"Tropical bitter dank juice. Super turbid, golden hop nectar. Getting classic Mosaic flavors. Lots of papaya, pineapple and nectarines. This kind of tastes like an awesome double Tree House ipa. Great level of sweetness. The only downside to this for me is after you drink a bunch of it, the malt character starts to build up on you a bit."
"I got this one the day of release and had it the same night. It's very floral/piney. I get quite a bit of grapefruit in this one. Smells great, tastes great. Another win from Trillium."
"Just pure hop juice with a nice dry crackery malt backbone. Aromas of pineapple and mango, opaque unfiltered appearance with minimal head retention. Spot drinkability with only the slightest hint of booze to cut the juicy flavors."
Bottled dated 8/21/15; beer brewed for the Vermont HopJam Festival; drank on 8/23/15 in a Trillium tumbler
Typical of the hoppy Trillium offerings......
"Hops burst from the bottle. So juicy. So fruity. This definitely gives Heady a run for its money. And for about $12 a 750, it is a great deal. Like most of Trillium's stuff, it packs a hop punch without going overboard. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style."
"Purchased August 21, consumed August 22. One of the lucky few to land and consume out of a growler."
"Purchased growler on 8/21, drank on the same day. "
"Bottle. Turbid as a sonbitch. Minimal head. Glowing yellow color. Trillium aroma. Green and fruity hop extract. I smell the intensity of the Mosaic and the exotic Galaxy fruits. Columbus is very underrated. Hop candy sweetness. Flavor starts off with nectarine, guava and citrusy fruit. There is also a green and earthy hop flavor. Slightly spicy hops. Candied, sweet malt finish. Doughy biscuit malt with hops squished in. Not too bitter. Just pure hop goo. Full, creamy body. Similar to many of their other hoppy offerings. I keep coming back, don't I?"
Hazy straw yellow with a moderate sized head. The foam fades fast leaving minimal lacing. 
"Poured into a Trillium tulip just a few hours after bottling. Looks like all of Trillium's DIPAs, which is to say beautiful. The best way I can describe the aroma is to say that is smells almost exactly like the brewery itself does. Another fantastic DIPA from Trillium."
An amazing hop bomb! Oh my Lordy! Trillium has outdone themselves this time.
"Can. Full-on hazy peach color with frothy off-white head with very good retention. Aroma has overripe tropical fruits, juicy hops but also some more classic herbal notes. Taste has a biscuity malt base, even slightly nutty with the hops leaning towards the herbal and grassy side. Aftertaste lingers with grapefruit rind bitterness. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Extremely drinkable DIPA with no hint of the 8% ABV. It's not a juicebomb like other hazy IPAs these days but it's very hoppy and well put together."
"04/2016 - As much as I love Double Citra, this is next level - just a perfect representation of my favorite hop - Galaxy! From the nose, to the palate, to the finish, this ale crushes and is easy to crush, too, despite the ABV!"
From a growler picked up at the brewery today. Hands down the best use of galaxy hops I’ve ever had in a beer. The high ratings are spot on!
From can (2 weeks).
"Opaque pale yellow, almost like banana puree, with a large, off-white foam that settles in thick lumps to a fuzzy collar leaving pock mark lace on glass."
"One of the few beers I have rated 5/5. Definitely a deserving brew. Try it, you'll agree. Canned 5/14/18, drank 6/22/18 and still delicious! Cheers"
Definitely not the same quality as I've experienced from their growler fills- but I wouldn't kick it out of bed. Last batch of TH Green kicked this one's ass and I'm not really a TH guy. Will have to get back up to the source
"Had this on 2018-06-04 in Columbia, PA from a fresh, 12oz can"
"Hazy as hell with minimal bitterness, not very juicy but damn smooth....."
Past it's prime by about 2 weeks but damn this is good
Look: Hazy yellow with turbid with big white creamy head. Has medium low carbonation.
"Filled a Treehouse growler. Consumed the next day. 2/15/18 "" Imperial single hop pale ale"". "
12oz can received in @WesMantooth's hoppy BIF box.
One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Nothing shines too much but everything is absolutely perfect. The flavor in this one is just as strong as anything. It is ridiculous how well balanced the HF IPAs are.
"This is one of the best IPAs I have ever tried. Much thanks to @buking21 for the hook-up! Perfect hop aroma, tons of juice and dank, glides down. Wow!"
"I've said before that it's pretty hard to mess up an IPA with Galaxy hops. This beer proves that theory once again, but also shows how to master an IPA with Galaxy hops. It's inviting orange juice appearance is quickly distracted by the amazing aromas which only force you to indulge instantly in the juice, fruity, flavorful bliss of this, dare I say, masterpiece. And if that wasn't good enough, the feel is so intoxicatingly smooth and creamy, with a noticeable bitter bite to make any IPA fan happy. This is how this style of IPA is done folks. Cheers!"
L: pours a hazy pale orange
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip. Pineapple forward with a touch of hop bitterness. Very nice cloudy pale yellow look, solid mouthfeel. Well done!"
Can thanks to Kevin!
"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. Smell is classic Galaxy hops with notes of orange/grapefruit pulp, earthy/floral hops, pineapple and light resiny sweetness (tropical). Taste follows the nose with great creamy body up front. Then, a surge of refreshing orange pulp and earthy hop flavor transitions to the finish. Sweetness is low to moderate with a really nice honey/resin character, and bitterness is fairly low. Carbonation is relatively low as well, just about perfect."
12 oz can poured into speigelau IPA glass canned on 8/28
750ml growler dated Sept. 7
"Poured from can into my d-bag neckbeard teku. No canning date, but no more than a week old at this point. "
Amazing beer!
"On tap at The Blue Stone. This was poured into a tall tulip. The appearance was a pure orange juice to rind color. One finger white foamy head that dissipated pretty quickly. Light lacing here and there. The smell had a stunning burst of bittersweet orange juice with bitter grapefruit pulp and rind backing it all up. Light sweet mango strolls in underneath. The taste copied the aroma nicely. Bittersweet orange juice aftertaste slides into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping to sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the bitterness from the hops to pack an appropriate punch. Overall, beautifully and wonderfully done. A masterpiece of a DIPA that I know I would have again."
"Had 2 of these at The Guild Tavern in S. Burlington, VT for my birthday dinner. Pours a very turbid, light yellow color. There is no seeing through this beer. Very thick looking."
Very cloudy yellow coloring and slight head on top. This beer had heavy tastes of fruit throughout
"I had this on draught in a restaurant. 16 oz. pour served in a tulip glass. It pours a turbid, muddy yellow mustard color with one finger of milk-white head and extensive lacing that persisted through the pour. It has a delightful aroma of tangerine, melon, grapefruit, a whiff of caramel, and subtle, floral hops. I admit that at first I wasn't wowed by the taste but as the glass warmed I changed my mind. Lots of grapefruit, melon, caramel, and pine. The hops are evident but not bitter and the fruit taste really came forward. I think the most amazing attribute was the mouth feel. This may be the most creamy DIPA I've had and with an ABV of only 6% I could drink this all day! By the time I finished, I understood, and concurred, with the world-class rating. Amazing stuff!"
"Cloudy yellow, plenty of white foam. "
"Another winner from Hill Farmstead. Just like most of their brews I've had this one is not a big - in your face juice bomb but just a well done, tasty and super smooth beer that drinks easy but still packed with flavor. Wonderful beer"
"Pours an opaque dirty orange. Basically no head, but was poured from a growler"
"Look: Poured from a 750ml Growler filled at the brewery into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy golden, orange color and is for all intents and purposes opaque. Virtually nonexistent head, and leaves characteristic lace around the glass. Exactly what I look for in a good DIPA."
Good beer!
"Hill Farmstead Brewery ""Double Galaxy"""
"Bottle share on 7/30/16, thanks to Jeremy. Hazy straw colored pour, small wispy head. Fruity aroma, tropical, melon, mango, citrus. More big fruit flavors in the taste, but still allowing some maltiness to make itself known. Very refreshing on a hot day, almost too fruity for an IPA, but delicious."
"A: Hazy, dark orange in color with a thin white sticky head."
Great beer from hill farmstead
"Clean, balanced, beautiful aroma and very juicy. This is very close to a TH juice bomb. Ridiculously good and loved drinking it. Would recommend to anyone, one of the best HF IPA's you can get"
Served on tap in a snifter.
On tap at Pony Bar. 
Appearance- light orange clear with light creamy head and nice lacing
Wow. Just wow.
"Double Galaxy is the best DIPA I've ever had and one of the best beers I've had bar none! It is thick, looks thick, drinks smoothly (like all Hill Farmstead) and tastes amazing! People describe IPA's as tropical tasting, but I was never able to taste tropical fruits in an ipa. That is until I had Double Galaxy. It was bursting with orange, bananas, mangoes, pineapples, guava, peaches and other yummy fruits. It also introduced me to the Galaxy hop, which has become a favourite of mine. Double Galaxy is an outstanding beer. Its way better than Treehouse beers which currently 7/5/16 rank higher than it. I highly recommend drinking it. Awesome stuff!!!"
"L - hazy but not totally opaque, medium orange, head fades to a thin layer"
Wow! A delicious DIPA with ample citrus all the way through.
This is by far one of my most favorite double IPA's from Hill Farmstead. First time I had it I told my buddy it tastes like a fluffy cloud. Highly recommend this beer. very smooth for a double IPA.
Growler procured from the source.
"This is phenomenal. Served in tulip glass at three penny bar in Burlington. Most impressive mouth feel of any beer I've ever had. Good straight up New England style IIPA. Exceptional citrus flavor sets this apart from West Coast offerings. No caramel, malty aftertaste. Stunning!"
"From a growler picked up at the brewery. This is an insane DIPA. Nice unfiltered look; plenty of lacing. Nose is a little light -- citrus and a little funk. Lots of orange, orange peel, and a bit of funk in taste -- super clean, super smooth. This is one of the top IPA type beers I have had -- very much different, but in the same world class as the Abner I had yesterday. Bottom line - it is going to be real hard to put Vermont in my rear view mirror tomorrow knowing that Hill Farmstead doesn't make it down my way. Well worth getting off of the beaten path to visit Greensboro Bend and pick up some real gems."
"Had this one on tap at Armsby Abbey today. It poured a nice yellow golden color with a nice head and great lacing. The smell was citrus and fruity, orange. The taste just blew me away. Very nice profile of citrus, orange and maybe a bit of pineapple with a bitter grapefruit at the finish. The mouthfeel was excellent. I wish I could have stayed for another one but I was on my way to Tree House. I hope to get to try this one again soon."
"Had it tonight on tap at Armsby Abbey; freaking amazing. It reminds me very much of Green, but a little bit less ""on your face"" and with a smoother mouthfeel.﻿"
"Truly an outstanding beer, by far the best that I've tried from Hill Farmstead. Huge fruit and sweetness flavor profile, with the piney and dank kick. Highly recommended!"
"Fresh growler poured into a snifter glass. Pours somewhat hazy copper color with a decent amount of head. The small and flavors consist of mangos, pineapples, citrus, pine, fresh grass, somewhat herbal; very clean IMO. The hint of alcohol is very limited here. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and would love to try some more ASAP! Cheers!"

Damn Daniel!
This beer is the real deal. Pours a super hazy orange with a finger of pillowy white head. Smells like a melange of passion fruits..Taste is the same. Best dipa (even better than ks). Amazing
"Had on tap at Armsby. This is truly a delight. Pours a orange hazy golden color. It's not turbid, but it's not translucent either. White head. Aroma is citrusy. There is a ton of orange citrus, with some resin, and a mineral texture to this DIPA. I really love this beer."
its beers like this that make me feel truly blessed to live in VT. had this on tap at manhattan's 
750 filled 2/5
"2-8-16 - On tap at TRIA in Philly. Served in their classic ""T"" stemmed tulip. Cloudy with straw color. Swirls on top. Super good with hoppy and kind-of fruity flavors. Another great one and glad TRIA had this gem."
A beautiful beer. Citrus cloudiness. One of the best.
"Look - That wonderful New England style look. Murky, cloudy, turbid. Love it. "
"This one really blew my mind; had a really sudsy (but not bubbly) carb, with a dank, earthy hop flavor that lingered long after the take. Not to mention it looks beautiful."
"Pours beautiful vibrant orange, hazy through. Smells of citrus and spicy hops. Taste is bitter, smooth, lots of grapefruit and some pine with a light sweetness. Another solid DIPA from Hill Farmstead."
Pours a Hazy yellowish orange color. Smell is light pineapple and citrus fruits.. taste is so smooth. it great citrus flavor through it.. mouthfeel is very solid... HF has maybe the most refined beers there are.. this was another winner for sure..
"Citrus and malt cracker balance on the nose. Taste follows suit. Great overall offering from HF. I prefer more punchy citrus. But, for those of you that like balance, this one's for you."
Poured from a 750mL growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Purchased at the brewery a few days ago. 
Had this one on tap at Armsby Abbey
Growler poured into a snifter.
"Had a glass at Judy & Punch. Appeared a hazy yellow, as you'd expect. The Aussie hops come out with a huge peach with a creamy floral undertones. It's a great imperial IPA and delicious, but not quite as interesting or complex as some of the other opaque IPAs from HF."
"Similar in style to most of there Double series ipas. The overwhelming galaxy hop gives it a mild vomit or puke taste in my mouth that i cannot escape. Its very nice, smells wonderful, but for some reason i cant get over this feeling i get when i drink it. Had 2 750mls growlers and they were both overwhelming"
"Growler. Poured like pure fruit juice. Tropicana. Aroma is denser and has less pop than I was expecting. No matter, it still smelled pretty impressive. Galaxy, to me, always has such a ripe, tropical fruity aroma and then the flavor is more assertive. The nose here is mixed citrus with passion fruit. The flavor is more pungent than the nose. A really strong, tropical fruit medley. Passion fruit and some grass. Creamy, full bodied ale. Slightly below my expectations but my head was in the clouds for this one."
"I will preface this by saying that Double Citra is my favorite IPA, and I love galaxy hops, so I was very excited for this one. It's not as juicy as I was expecting, and it's not as well-balanced as its Citra sibling, but this is still a world class IPA. Beautiful to look at, refreshing, finishes clean. If I could drink these everyday, I wouldn't live long."
750ml bottle poured into a globe.
Really excellent
Another amazing offering by Hill Farmstead! Galaxy is not typically my favorite hops variety but this Single Hop DIPA was amazing!!! Enjoyed with friends from a 750ml growler. Nice citrus notes and smooth finish but tons of hops character!
"Another bright and refreshing offering from Hill Farmstead. It's not my favorite from them, but it certainly holds its own as a solid entry in their lineup."
Growler bottled 10/14/2015.
On tap at The Well in Brooklyn. Perfectly murky...amazing juicy hop aroma. Fantastic juicy hop flavor with perfect bready balance. So smooth it's insane. Absolutely love this...wish I could drink all the time.
L - super hazy and opaque. Glows beautifully in the fluorescent light. Fresh lager of OJ on top and murk on the bottom. Beautiful. 
"Looks hazy orange, a beautiful amount of foam forms and stays for minutes. Looks like Sunny D and the smell is world class. Resin, earth qualities matched with Danky juice and the perfect amount of garlic. Taste is world class this is insane. Really the perfect blend between resin and juice. They balance so well and the alcohol is no where to be found. Mouthfeel is where I like it. Just enough bite to remind you it's full of hops but plenty of smooth orange/white grape danky goodness. Definitely my favorite brewery - makes me want to visit Vermont STAT"
The beer comes in a hazy pale gold.
This is a great offering. Love the creaminess of the mouthfeel. Comes in just below Double Citra in the HF hop catalog.
750 growler poured into a nonic glass. 
"Picked up a 750mL growler at the brewery on 9/26 and drank it on 9/29. Pours a cloudy orange color with not a big head, leaves some lacing. Big wallop on the aroma of oranges and citrus, sweet, with a nice malt note in there. Resinous hoppiness. The taste is pure sweet orange juice, much more so than the Edward I had before. Some tropical notes in there, too, and the bready and doughy malts try to form a backbone. Body is a bit thinner than expected for a DIPA, but overall quite light and easy to drink, no alcohol present. Simply a lovely, citrusy DIPA from those awesome Galaxy hops!"
Appearance is of murky golden wheat with a classy gentle blanket of off white foam and a solid ring of lacing that cascades pretty evenly around the bowl of my glass. The aroma brings bold orange/lemon citrus with a lightly grassy mustiness. Very appetizing. The flavor delivers big juicy orange grass with mild lemon edges and piney malt. Fairly intense but mellowed slightly by the woodsy grain ideas. The body is medium plus with a finely full carbonation that blankets the tongue and finishes with a lively but mildly sticky feel. Just a class delivery of wonderful hops here.
"Fresh squeezed orange juice. 2 finger foamy head that leaves behind a nice dollop. Great lacing. Smell is an earthy pine with dank citrus. Among other citrus, some orange and grapefruit peel. Limey bitterness in the back. Signature HF feel. Great beer."
"On tap at Armsby Abbey, this beer is loaded with tropic fruits. Pineapple, and grapefruit smells all over the place. Taste follows the nose. One of the best ipas I have had from HF! So well done."
"Is there a better showcase of galaxy hops available? I doubt it. Got this on draft at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. This beer is chock full o' pineapple and grapefruit goodness. It's a hoppy punch in the face and oh so delicious."
Tasty if you love the Galaxy hop for sure
"Oh, Hill Farmstead. Aren't you mortal? Isn't there something that you DO wrong?"
"Aromas of orange, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, alcohol and flowers"
Poured from a brewery-filled growler into a US tumbler pint glass.
"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled about 10 hours ago"
Split with angrybabboon.
"pretty standard awesome double single hop beer that Hill puts out. It's just really good. The double Citra might be a smidgen better, but it's so close."
750 mL growler filled 10/2. Served at 40F into a HF wine glass.
"Poured from a bomber into a stemmed glass. This was filled at the brewery Wednesday, October 8th and consumed on October 10th."
"Big enjoyable hoppy beer, one of the best I've had. The galaxy hops are very prominent, very tasty, and very smooth. The hops manage to be full front and center without getting bitter or overpowering."
"Thanks again, jchem! From growler labeled best by 10/16 into nonic pint."
Hazy amber color. Lots of tropical fruit aroma. Very intense floral taste to go along with the great tropical fruit. This is one of the best hop showcases I've come across.
"Fantastic beer, but what else would you expect from those guys up at hill farmstead? Found it very different from the edward or their other ipa's it had a bite that resembled some of the Heady hoppiness. Overall the mouthfeel was definitely what I appreciated the most, cant wait to make the trip up to Greensboro and visit again!"
"A: Poured from a 750 ml bottle ""growler"" purchased at Hill Farmsted in VT. Body is hazy yellow with a white head. Good lace."
"Pour is hazed yellow amber with lots of tight white head. Nose is hoppy peach, not super bright but hops lead in nose. Taste is a bit muddled. Stronger hop presence, peach and tropical fruit with a light bitterness. Body is light with a strong carb and clean finish."
"A - Opaque cloudy bright orange colour, yellow towards the edges. A thin layer of cream coloured head formed and left some nice lacing behind."
750ml flip-top growler opened on 1.18.14

"Hill Farmstead - Double Galaxy, poured into a DFH Spiegelau IPA glass. "
Growler is two weeks old. Teku glass.
"750ml growler generously sent to me by Anthony. Thanks a lot man! Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass today, 1/15/2014. My main comparison is Pipeworks Galaxy Unicorn as that is the one other Galaxy-hopped DIPA that stands out in my mind."
A-Bright cloudy yellow orange two finger head that leaves lots of lacing.
"750ml growler filled at the brewery yesterday, split with Kev."
A - Light tangerine color with a warm glow to it. Small white head
"Light straw colored body with a fluffy white head. Smell is citrus juice with light pine and almost fruity. This is probably the best IPA I've ever had including many from Alpine, Heady, Pliny, etc. The balance is incredible, and this drinks juicy but not sweet. The hop is incredibly delicate and the star of the show. Nothing gets in the way of the hop. Pretty much a perfect beer."
32oz growler (Tired Hands) poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
Thanks to MikeyPNH for scoring this growler for me.
A - A cloudy Honey yellow with one finger white head.
A - Cloudy honey-yellow color with a medium bodied white head that lingered nicely with some lacing behind.
Pour this from a HF Growler. 5 days old. Still...perfect. Amazing.
"The second you pour the galaxy the citrus assaults your nose- I immediately thought of pink grapefruit blood orange and tangerines. Certainly more of a citrus overtone and a fruity undertone- mango for sure. Fuck the blah blah shit- amazing hops character with excellent grapefruit and tangerine taste in the background. Quite bitter but doesn't go too far overboard, not a strong booze taste at all (very well masked) and not so malty, however why the fuck would I want malt in a doub? Insane hops is what is what I came for and its what I got in return. I live in VT so not so hard for me to get my hands on, but if you can do so its worth a 2 hr wait in line"
"Pours a hazy yellow-gold with a small white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, piney, resinous hops, caramel, and butter. Flavor of bitter, citrusy, and resinous hops, pineapple, caramel, biscuit, mango, and floral notes. Medium-bodied, with a sweet, juicy, resinous mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. This beer really reminds me of the Ephraim! This was a very good DIPA that really showcases the galaxy hops."
A huge thanks to the awesome trader montrealbcr89 for bringing this 750 back from a recent trip to the farmstead and getting it to me with haste. 
I got to try this beer thanks to DonFrap. Thanks Don!
On tap at Black Back Pub. Served into a stemmed HF glass.

Big thanks to dujayhawk for hooking me up! Reviewed from notes. Poured from HF growler into Russian River pint glass.
"Thank you, Eric. This review took me about 40 mins, as I allowed the beer to evolve and my sobriety to be compromised. "
Poured from a growler into a tasting glass. We had this to break up the barleywines.
"Poured a pale orange in color with pale yellow highlights and a thin bubbly head that left a little lacing sticking to the glass. Very nice citrusy sweet candy hops show their face first with good malt sweet character, signs of grapefruit, with pine and earhty notes. Nice hop profile consisting of citrus pine and earthiness with candi sugar accents, good bready malty sweetness, notes of pineapple and grapefruit accents. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, hoppy, bready, semi malty, piney and slight bitter finish."
Big thanks to Kyle for getting this one for me. 22oz. growler into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
750ml to Lawson's Sniffer
"A - Murky light apricot, HUGE head, tons of cling lace that lasts forever. Head has long stay too."
A-golden orange color with a nice white head and good lacing
Pours a hazy orange with a beautiful bright white and creamy head on top. Citrus and tropical fruits pack a punch right up front on the nose. A nice variety of lemon and orange alongside juicy mango and pineapple. Just a hint of pine resin in the background.

"Thinking this will be the pinnacle of our Vermont trip on Saturday, December 29th. This was tapped that Saturday morning and we grabbed three growlers of it. Reviewing new years eve...."
"ok, i haven't had this for about a year, so i'm going from memory. But the memory is a beautiful thing. This beer was ""SUMMER IN A GLASS""! big fruity grapefruit aroma just radiating out of the top of the glass. the taste was bright grapefruity hops. summer in Vermont is SHORT and a glass of this beer helps you to pause and take in and enjoy every moment you can and think ""hey, i can walk down the street in shorts and a t-shirt and feel just fine!"""
"750mL flip-top thanks to oteyj. Hazy, glowing deep orange pour. Fluffy, buttermilk head. Huge, 360, sheets of lacing. Long retention. Significantly fruitier, more tropical melon aroma than the Columbus Pale Ale. Vanilla tinged alcohol noticeable in the nose along with sticky jackfruit, mango, cantaloupe. Taste is soft, balanced, fruity, thicker mango and sweet strawberries saved by decent pine resin. Quite rich and almost dessert like compared to other HFS hop bombs. Doesn’t get boozy at all, which is quite nice. Thicker, oily mouthfeel. Fluffy. Long, quenching palate with mild peach yogurt. 8% is impossibly hidden. Be careful ;) 3/28/2012 8/5/8/5/16=4.2"
"2L growler, drank a week later. Very murky hazy blond pour with very small head. Probably the worst looking beer I’ve had from Hill Farmstead. Aroma is a burst of tropical fruits, mango and pinneaples with a woody and rustic touch. Taste: Citrusy and spicy hops. Not as expressive as the other HF DIPA I’ve had but highly drinkable. Full bodied med-low carbonation. A little attenuated because it wasn’t consumed as fast as it should have. Should have drank this one sooner, but still very good nonetheless."

Enjoyed on tap at the Armsby Abbey during Hill Farmstead tap takeover. Reviewed from notes.

122nd Review 
"Growler driven back from Vermont by me. Also sampled at the Three-Penny, Armsby Abbey, and a sampler at the brewery. Just outstanding every time!"
"Hill Farmstead Galaxy, paid a visit to the brewery in Greensboro Vermont and cannot wait to go back. Billed as ""Double Galaxy"" and sold at $9 per 750ml bomber (plus $3 cost of the capper bottle)."
On-tap at Armsby Abbey. Reviewed from notes.
"750ml swing-top growler poured into my Southern Tier tulip. It poured a pale, yellow orange color that was a little reminiscent of pineapple juice. A thick, frothy, white colored head filled the top two inches of the glass and clung to the sides as I drank it. "

"After having had this each time it has been brewed (on tap and from growlers), it's about time for a review."
"deep crystal clear amber with a nce foamy head that was slow to fad, leaving a fine lace all the way to the bottom. The smell is deep piney hops with a bit of grapefruit thrown in for good measure. The taste...well lets just say this ain't you daddy's beer!! Knock you down hops, beautiful, strong, pine and citrus that will have you puckering your mouth for a while. Great dry finish. This is a hop heads delight and lived up to the hype"
"This beer pours a yellowish slightly orange color with a good sticky off-white head that laces the glass as it recedes. The smell is out of the world spicy and citrus hop aromas emanate from the glass. The flavor is right there as well with citrus and spicy hop notes and a slight malt backbone to round it out just a little bit, but this is still extremely dry and hoppy. The mouthfeel is light to medium and good carbonation. Overal this is hands down the best single hop ipa I have ever had, it even beats out some if the multiple hopped dipa"
Got a growler fill at the Saison event this past weekend.
750 ML pour from the Hill on 8/6/11
Counter pressure filled yesterday. I've had Ephraim before but not this one. My palate is a little wrecked from the Saison fest yesterday so...

On tap poured into a tulip. 
Had ok tap at the good life in massapequa park. Got there about 15 mons after tapped. Murky dark straw colored. Galaxy hops all day. Seems that this hop is really gaining in popularity lately. Sweaty and thick. Very hop forward. Only complaint is the heaviness of the brew. Super great IPA and worthy of the hunt. This beer can hang with the best of them.
Much thanks to Michael for providing this one!

Three cheers for Sean for sharing this growler.
"Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew, again."
"According to this ""Expert"" my review is as follows... super unique color of a dark murky honey gold with tons of orange, super dark orange deep in the body, a cool light tope head... the nose is a bit light, some nice grass hops with a bit of dank, a bit of orange peel, good but cursing that I’m not having this totally fresh... the taste is super buttery grass hops... a really good beer, but getting a touch too hyped right now"
"Growler shared by Thorpe429 at his place the other night. Thanks! A big want, obviously because at the time of this review, this is the #44 beer on the beeradvocate best of list ""popular"" and the #6 beer on the best of American Double / Imperial IPA. This probably means I'm going to love it. "
"I've had this beer on-tap at the brewery, on-tap at Parker Pie Co. (near the brewery), and this is the second time I'm enjoying it from a growler. 750ml Hill Farmstead flip-top growler into my Bruery tulip. All to myself! (don't worry guys, I got a 2nd one to share)."

"On draft at the Blind Tiger, NYC. "
Cheers and thanks to weeare138 for sharing this brew. 
"Growler from my main HF man Glouglouburp - pours a muddy orange with a nice frothy white head. Nose - mango, grassy hops. Taste- big tropical fruit punch followed with grassy and pine notes. Very resinous and has a lingering white grapefruit rind bitterness. Some sweet pale malts also come through but by and large a fairly dry dipa. This is one helluva hop monster- very unique offering."

Re-review 9/27/15 enjoyed from the 750ml growler shared with tenderbranson69 in a Hill Farmstead goblet.
"for a single hop... this is one amazing hop. there are subtle characteristics of a collection of other hops in this one. pour is nice and lacy but not a sugar bomb. the nose is citrus... this is a DIPA on the fruity side. some pine earth hints. nose of mango, tangerine and hints of grapefruit. palate is a bit citrus tropical. beautifully refreshing for a DIPA. it good to see something this nice when there are so many trying."
"12oz pour in a tulip at The Farmhouse Tap & Grill for ""Hoppy Easter."""

"On tap at the Blind Tiger Ale House during the Hill Farmstead event. This hop strand was a new hop hybrid from Australia, bred from the Perle Hop. The Galaxy produces flavors of citrus and passionfruit, with a significant bitterness on the tongue. An excellent new hop strand to assault my palette!"
Review from my notes. Thanks to Baconsausage for hooking this up.
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a frothy two finger pillowy white head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with chunks of soapy lacing. "
"Wow! This beer tastes like pineapple juice. It is so hoppy it's incredible.The Galaxy is really showed up and you prefer much know what that hops tastes like after drinking this DIPA. The color is great, pale, yellow with a white head."
This is the beer I would take on a desert island. 
"On the tap at Blind Tiger, this beer had the misfortune of being sampled directly after the magic of Ephraim. How could anything top that sick bastard? Well, this one would attempt to use my memories against me, trick me into thinking it was better. Even though this was a new hop, a descendant of Perle, it reminded me of standing in the gigantic Hopunion refrigerated warehouse, swaying, intoxicated by the brilliant and bold aromas of citrus assaulting me. In an instant with my nose in the glass, I was transported back to Yakima, a kid in the nose candy store. The flavor was nice, some sweetness, oranges, tangerines, and the resins lingered with the sweetness nicely. Ultimately, another awesome DIPA, but quite a different brew."
Had at the Blackback Pub.
"Poured into a Hill Farmstead tasting glass. An unfiltered, peach-orange body holds up a thick, foamy, white head. Lots of beautiful lacing."
"You have to really like hops, but if you do, this is really tasty - sweaty socks and well-balanced, with no bitterness."
"08/2014 - Grapefruit, floral bouquet, hops up front; fruity, well hopped body with lingering peach, and a bit of pepper on the back of the palate; balanced, yet a wee bit of bitterness on the finish."
My favorite in a major blind tasting. So delicious.
"Smell, look, and feel are exactly what you expect from opaque NE-style IPAs "
This beer is hazy and delicious. Probably the first beer I ever fell in love with.
"They had me at ""double dry hopped"". Leaping out with copious additions of Galaxy hops, Trillium Brewing's Congress Street sees a breath of fresh air that's nothing like our other congress."
Unreadable date on bottom of can...
pours beautiful hazy orange with nice head to it. smells of dank tropical fruit. good mouthfeel thick feeling but still light slight bitter finish
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/11/2017. Pours opaquely hazy golden/orange/green color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild pine, herbal, grassy, zesty bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an outstanding NEIPA! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the very mildly bitter/drying finish. Outstanding soft feel for the style. Very juicy and lightly dank Galaxy hop complexity; balanced pale/wheat malt backbone, not overly sweet/heavy for the style. Held up extremely well considering the can dating. I'm sure fresh would be mind blowing, as I had regular Congress Street a while ago. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected."
"Canned on 05/04/18, 09:38:05."
"one my top 5, i'd put this beer up against any. great aroma with well balanced hoppiness"
"Superb milky orange body, essentially opaque, with a pungent nose of grapefruit and peaches, with mild mint and pine beneath. Lovely fruit juice flavor, mildly bitter close suggesting grapefruit pith. The feel is light for the power. Delicious milky glory. Well worth seeking."
16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. 
I believe this was one of the brews we tasted in while staying in a Red Roof Inn one evening and it held up well against other Trillium Brews. Not among the best IPAs I've tasted but good none-the-less and I would certainly drink this one again.
"This is the definition of a true NEIPA! A strong citrus character up front of orange, grapefruit and pineapple. Awesome hops follow on the backend that linger, reminding you that this is DDH beer. I always enjoy the aroma of good galaxy hops!"
On tap at brewery
my favorite beer :0)
"It's difficult to put my finger on my favorite Trillium IPA. This one is a tremendously good beer, and certainly a contender - but I'm expecting DDH Fort Point to blow it away."
"Surprised I hadn’t reviewed this yet. I find DDH offerings from trillium fantastic, but I can only drink one before my palette is blown - ddh Congress street is no exception. "
Pours a light matte yellow color. Completely opaque and super hazy. Thinnish weak white head dissipates quickly leaving no residual lacing or head. 
"Finally got to tick this one. Looks and smells like a lot of Trillium beer but the feel is fantastic. The ddh treatment really works here. I've heard ""best Trillium beer"" from many folks and I don't quite agree (I prefer their DIPAs) but it is possibly their best ddh single IPA."
Just a World Class Beer all beer geeks should try. Did I mention over and over.
I'll just start off by saying this is the best beer I've ever had. It's all downhill from here.
"Canned date is September (unreadable), 2017, poured into tulip. "
"Pours a hazy deep orange, with thck, fine foam. A beauty..."
"Appearance: pours a very cloudy golden yellow color with a 1/2"" head that falls to a spotty surface foam."
"Galaxy and Columbus, double dry hopped, pack one helluva punch... Kinda orange-juice-colored, but murkier, with a couple of fingers of white foam atop... Aroma is powerfully fragrant with grapefruit and juicy citrus, followed with a sharp and tangy, bitter pith ride... Grips the tongue, tingly and cutting... Medium-weight feel with modest carbonation... A real killer of an IPA... 10/9/17 canning..."
16oz can purchased at the Canton brewery dated 10/9 17. A hazy orange look and citrusy nose with some honeydew melon included. Tastes include orange and other citrus along with a honeydew melon and maybe apricot component. Grapefruit comes in lightly on the finish. A delicious beer and one of our favorites from Trillium.
"From a 10-day-old can, pours a hazy, milky gold. Small head leaves scant lacing. Smell is a big fruit basket, with peach, fresh orange, mango, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, pineapple, passionfruit and some piney, herbal dankness. Taste is similar, with a decent hit of grapefruit-pith bitterness. Feel is smooth but on the lighter side of medium. In spite of the small head, there's a bite of carbonation. Pretty awesome."
"Probably the best IPA I've ever had, and definitely in my top 5 beers. Poured from a can ~4 days after purchase, I regret waiting even that long. Looks almost like a glass of orange juice. Very hoppy, obviously, but not too bitter and easy to drink as well."
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a blend of citrus and hops. Taste is s nice balance of hops and citrus as expected from a high end IPA
"A gorgeous looking beer. It develops a murky yet still somewhat bright pulpy OJ color, as if a flashlight is shone under muddy water. The head is puffy and creamy, 3 fingers to start, and recedes to a thin ring. Can't get any better. "
"Poured 9/16/2017 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery that same day, into a US tumbler pint glass."
Poured from a 16oz can into a speiglau IPA glass. 
"Canned 9/7/17, drinking the day of canning."
"Tasted from can. Pours a super cloudy orange with thick white head. Appearance of juice. Aroma is ridiculously tropical fruity. Mango, peach, passion fruit, pineapple. Very well balanced. Flavors of mango, pineapple, passion fruit, slight resin, caramel and hints of floral notes. Incredible IPA"
A - Pours a turbid golden orange with a fizzy white head. Decent amount of soapy lacing.
"Boom Zarahamay... first wish of the day... I wish I could drink this every day, but sadly its not available to me regularly. Still my gold standard for NEIPAs."
"From fresh can into IPA glass. Wow is this turbid, more so then any other I've seen of this NE style. Looks like orange juice. Big bubbles and not much lacing. smells of grapefruit and orange peel. Taste is like no other, wow, starts with OJ then tangerine then a sharp sour grapefruit rind on the back tongue then alcohol warmth. Lingering bitterness, Wow, totally different then most DIPAs. Total extreme juicy citrus bomb! it's amazing this is all from the hops and most likely the double dry hopping. I'm having a hard time rating this since it's so out there and different but in the end i thank its one of the best. It definitely heightens the bar for the NE DIPA style."
Can dated 7/17 and consumed 7/31.
"Had on draft at the Canton facility, so much haze and such a vibrant aroma. mouthfeel and malt and hop balance were almost perfect. As good or better than anything out there."
"Smell: Immediately your hit with huge over ripe pineapple and tropical fruits. Mango, peach, juicy orange, tangerine. Some grapefruit zest and pine. Bubblegum Herbaceous, you also get a slight alcohol presence."
"From the bottom of a can purchased from the Fort Point location: ""CANNED ON 10-JUL-17 07:54"""
fresh can 7/10
Like it just slightly more than Congress Street. Trillium makes some quality beers.
"had in a can. This brew has a strong bite in the nose, but very subtle finish. the look is a light golden haze, but no fruity overtones that I am picking up on."
"Pure OJ out of the can. Whereas the aroma of tropical fruit and some pine is the hallmark of Congress Street, this DDH version is all fruit and fauna . Taste of guava, mango, pineapple, apricot and orange. Massive hop kick as expected; but there's still a nuanced cascade of fruit flavors with a very light malt backbone that doesn't detract from the citrus...at all. Soft mouthfeel but the acidity is there on account of all the citrus. Light bitterness closes the proceedings."
For me this a the perfect beer. A total juice bomb. Fruity and grassy at the same time with a dry finish. Soft and creamy mouth feel. All around outstanding.
Thanks Kevin!
"This is a strait up juice bomb. Pours like a glass of ourange juice. Aroma is big citrus. Taste is juicy citrus with a nice smooth finish. Has a good feel, not too thin like many in this style. Overall really delicious."
"Looks like cloudy papaya juice. Smell: fresh cut grass. Tropical hops. Lemon, mango, gin. Light bready malt. Taste: follows nose. Feel: medium. Effervescent yet slightly creamy. Overall: very good. There's definitely something in the water over there at Trillium."
Growler from the source.
From growler poured into pint glass - bottled 4/23/17
Solid
A 16 oz. can dated 3/6/17 poured into a tulip.
"Canned 04/11/17, it pours textbook New England IPA cloudy orange gold color with a solid 2 finger foamy white head that was packed with bubbles and dissipated very slowly, leaving real fine looking lacing coating the sides. "
"Milky yellow, white lacing head."
"Enjoyed this after another Galaxy bomb, Very Green. While it doesn't match up to Tree House's brilliant brew, DDH Congress is awesome in it's own right. Very sharp hop aromas that carry onto the taste. Slightly vinous note balances the citrus but damn this ting has zing! 32 oz. growler is more than enough in one sitting. Going to sit on my last three cans and see how this guy develops over the next month."
Consumed 4/14/17
"16 oz can, dated 3/6/17, poured into a teku"
"Pours an opaque yellow orange with a fluffy two finger head that has good retention, nice lacing."
"What a phenomenal beer, one of my favorites. "
Thanks goes out to colby600 and tasterschoice62 for this brew.
"Signature offering from Trillium. Beautiful color of burnt yellowish orange and decently turbid, without being overly so."
I'm amazed at the high ratings for this beer. This is the epitome of more is not better. Big fan of the street series of beers but I just don't get the DDH versions. They are so over saturated with hop flavor and aroma. The negative aspects of over dry hopping start to take over. This beer is very out of balance in my mind. Can is two weeks old and it's still very green and sharp. Amazed a Brewery held in such high regards would actual release this.
This was like the purest expression of the hop flavors. Tastes like the hop smells!!! Not like citrus or tropical fruit only. More like a beer ! No Orange juice here. Very solid IPA.
i really like it excellent retention and good lacing. Starts with bright grapefruit and tropical fruit hop flavor with caramel malt balancing the hops out well.
"I just don't know how Trillium does it. Had this side by side with some other NE style DIPA and this is just heads and shoulder better in every category. Nose is just amazing as with just about any Trillium DIPA or DDH IPA/APA, super juicy and pungent. Taste fully follows the nose and is just a perfect balance of hop bite, sweetness, and luscious creamy full complex taste. Can't get enough trillium."
Look: Opaque hazy pale orange with a thin white head. Very little activity.
"Pours a distinct orange juice like look, complete with the opaque, pastel orange color. The deviating factors from a typical orange juice look are the two fingers of white foamy head that retain well, before falling into a heavy ring of foam after a few sips. Lacing is tight and splattered about the glass well. Aroma is citrus, orange peel, with flowery hops, and a grainy backbone. Flavor profile is juicy, with absolutely no bitterness at all. Notes of citrus, orange, flowery hops, flour, and raw grain mingle to form a IPA that despite screaming ""hops"", remains brash with notes smashed all together. Mouth feel is a little fizzy, but otherwise medium in thickness and smooth. It feels just a little thinner than a pulp-free orange juice with a little bit of carbonation added. Overall, this beer has a lot going on to the point of being almost overwhelming. Surprisingly, the hop notes are rather muted in this beer. It's almost as if there are so many stuffed into each glass that various notes drown and suffocate each other out. "
"Super hazy from the double dry hop. Great mouthfeel/carbonation. Aromas of stonefruit, melon, and lime on the nose. Taste is a balanced IPA with the malt and hops dancing with each other perfectly. Very juicy/fruity overall. My favorite offering from them so far."
"Haven't had many better, that's for sure."
"This one is a true legend, straight off the Mount Rushmore of NEIPAs. It pours a milky peach color with Trillium's signature opaque neon haze. "
"Look: Yellow, super hazy, with one inch head that recedes quickly."
"I was lucky enough to try this as my first beer from Trillium, but must admit that I'm a bit disappointed for the hype surrounding, which I'm sure leaves me in a small minority. "
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 12/19/2016) into a Parish Brewing Teku 
Regular congress street is better to me
Acquired in trade - thanks Mike!
i dunno even know perfect citrus hoppy IPA.................................my head wants to explode like the picture on the Alchemist heady topper can if i mixed orange juice with a heady topper.
A: cloudy; medium gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded slowly to a wispy cap; nice lacing;
Drank 06-28-16. Literally a glass of OJ.
"Finally got to try this, been waiting a long time. Probably my favorite one of the double dry hopped series now. Nice orange New England ipa look. Such a nice juicy smooth rich taste. Very nice balance of hops and smooth. Absolutely loved this beer."
"For once, I like the base version of congress st much more. Its more inviting and is more flavorful. the DDH version- the flavors get lost. Trillium is my favorite brewery but this beer lets me down :("
My favorite beer from Trillium to date.
"Enjoying a ten-day old can provided to me by lunchboxhead. Beautiful unfiltered orange color that just screams NE IPA love. Nose has some mango with a hint of dank, not a huge nose though. Taste has apricot, mango and grapefruit. Slight bitter finish. Fairly dry versus juicy. Very nice mouth feel. This is a very nice beer, but not sure I get the super high ranking. There are several Trillium offerings that I like a good bit more. Maybe just my taste."
"Had on tap. Pours hazy, bright orange-yellow in color, with minimal head. Taste is big lime, lemon, pineapple juice and some dank hops. Slightly bitter and light bodied for the style. Gentle and sophisticated. Really good beer. I think I like regular Congress Street more, but this is very good. Well worth seeking out."
"Another hazy hop juice bomb, nice creamy head"
Like hop cereal.
Another winner from Trillium. Much like their other offerings this one will not blow you away with a huge hop hit up front but will win you over with each sip getting better than the last. Just so flavorful and tasty with long legs. Super smooth. Trillium brews are so well done and this is no exception.
Delicious on all fronts. Light. Flavorful. Citrusy. Nearly perfect.
On draft at Trillium (Canton location). 
"This stands firmly in my top 5 IPAs and my favorite from Trillium, though admittedly many of their hoppy beers could easily stand in its place. Hop juice with pulp, please."
Staight hop juice. Great on the nose and palate. Pours a bright orange and hazy. Bright hops greet you right away. Taste is smooth and lots of city's fruit comes through. One of best IPAs I've had.
"Pours a cloudy light yellow-orange with small head. Smells of mango and pine resin. Maybe more tropical fruit of pineapple. Taste is again tropical and follows the nose. It has a wonderful hop finish without excessive bitterness. Very balanced. Mouth feel is slightly chewy, but pleasant. Overall a very well done IPA."
"Bottle poured into claret glass. Hazy, creamy (Orange) yellow color. Variety of aromas present to the nose (see BA description). Nice carbonation with one finger head. Well balanced on the palate with modest lingering of hops at finished. Another great beer by Trillium!"
"Super hazy golden orange with a medium white head that fades and great lacing. Huge juicy hop nose on this. Notes of tropical fruit, mango, grassy hop resin, light pine, pineapple, nectarine and lightly sweet malt. Fuller side of medium, hefty for an IPA, slick, dry and clean in the finish. This is an unreal IPA, for sure one of the elites."
Another fine Trillum beer. Great aroma and very balanced taste. The complexity of the hops shine and this is one of the best beers they make. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer
"750 mL bottle. Hazy/murky orange. Smells of pine wood, mango, and bright orange. The woody flavor is almost like a spicy aroma. Taste is a little less dynamic. Mostly bright orange and tropical fruits. Pale malt sweetness. Orange and dank in the back end. A little sweet. Medium body, Lightly creamy."
One of the best IPAs I've had.
"L: This pours a creamy gold. A little dull in color, but otherwise a classic NE IPA."
"June 7th 2016 bottle, opened July 1st 2016."
"Pours very, very thick and smoothy-like. I know this really upsets some people, and while I’ll admit it’s not the prettiest of styles it’s still not bad looking. Also maybe people just don’t care about appearance anymore, since it’s getting cooler and cooler to drink your beer right out of the can like some kind of goddamn animal. Anyhow, it looks like a orange and pineapple smoothie. If you told me they put oil paint in it, or that it was made out of melted halloween masks, I would believe you."
"I like this beer, loads of guava and other bright fruit, with a soft mouthfeel."
"Poured out as a hazy orange with a fluffy white head on it. The smell of the beer is just overloaded with awesome hop aromas. The taste is like hoppy orange juice. It's very drinkable, overall this is probably my favorite Trillium offering."
Pours a cloudy light orange color with a 2-finger white head. Leaves plenty of lacing.
"Excellent IPA here. The Galaxy aromas exploded out of the glass and the hazy color that we all know from Trillium was on point. The flavor was tropical and grassy, with just a bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel was a little heavy, but still clean"
"This beer looks like orange juice; very hazy. Couple weeks old and still tastes great. Flavors are light citrus, peach with a mild bitter IPA finish that fades. Typical trillium bite that I've come to enjoy with the DDH varieties. Typical trillium aroma with some tropical fruit in there. This is one of their best offerings. I will be stocking up on this one when available. Excellent beer if you like IPA."
"Poured from a 750 into a snifter, the beer is an opaque, creamy, peach coloring, almost like orange juice, with a filmy, clingy, white head. Aromas of amazing fruit sweetness, juicy and bright, with notes of passion fruit, orange juice, melon, pineapple, and mango. Wow! Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on orange and mango, with a solid acidity to boot. Solid highlights of pineapple and melon, with subtle grassy hops characteristics. Big bodied, but with a dry, crisp undertone. The aftertaste is all juice, heavy on orange, but with solid tropical characteristics once again. Minimal bitterness, with a subtle acidity building into the slick, dry finish. Very tasty beer. Very juicy."
Almost 3 week old DDH Congress St
"Have to issue a dissent on this one. I definitely had high hopes, but the dry-hopping on the batch I had overpowered what is an excellent beer and one of my favorite IPAs. It was harsh, bitter and overly green. Hopefully, it was just a bad batch and will try again."
"L - Murkey, filthy light orange with no light getting through. Two fingers of white head.."
"Trillium just hits home runs with all their hops. Anything Double Dry Hopped by these guys is liquid gold. Congress Street alone is a gem of a beer, the DDH is incredible"
My favorite trillium yet
Thank you Matthew!
Canned 12/19/16. Consumed 12/27/16.
"pulpy orange juice appearance, dense white head leaves patches of lace. "
"Looks like the bottom of a saison keg. Milky. Like banana nectar and water mixed. Kinda raunch. Smells tasty. Grassy and fruity in the same sniff. Tastes good and hoppy. A little yeasty from being unfiltered? Anyway. Feel is a little flatter than would prefer. Chalky. Big resin/particle after feel. Kinda never gonna buy this again. Will stick to my summer, melcher, and fort point."
White head. Super cloud sunset orange.
"Ridiculous beer. Juiciest Trillium I have seen, nice color to it with some depth. Prototype NE Juicy IPA, kills TH in my opinion. Very nice complex aroma, some pine in there to add depth. Flavor is killer. Just incredible depth from the sweet fruit to the hop finish."
"It had a great tropical flavor. But like the regular Congress Street, I do not get why people are crazy over this."
Legit Juice bomb.
Age does not treat this beer well.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstraw with an impressive head that leaves a good deal of lacing
Thanks to JLindros for sharing this bottle. 
6/7/16
Bottle consumed 6/17/16. Bottled 6/7/16. Pungent hop aroma. Looks like orange/pineapple juice. This is quite an impressive IPA. One of the best singles I've had. The hype is true.
"Appearance- pale orange, haze for days with great lacing and light thin head"
"L - typical NE haze bomb, orange hue"
Holy juice bomb of an amazing beer! Another dry hopped gem from the great Trillium. I have to say I've had more trillium offerings than I can count and this one is one of the best.
"This is current top of my list when it comes to IPAs. Everything about this beer was amazing, especially the aroma and color. It basically looked like a mixture of orange juice and pineapple juice. I wish I had more than one of these, but am happy I had the opportunity to score one and drink it. Looking forward to trying more Trillium beers!"
This is a very juicy hop bomb! It is a very well made beer with a nice balance. I am already looking forward to having another one! Highly recommended.
"So take everything that was wonderful about regular congress street, including that wonderful mixture of topical fruits, pine and hops, and add a wonderful floral dry hopped backbone to the beer. It is breathtaking. I didn't think the hype for trillium was real, but I am so happy to be wrong!"
"most beautiful looking beer I've had to date, pours an insanely murky yellow, little bit of orange. head dissipates quickly but the lacing is gorgeous. smell is lots of orange, citrus, juice, little bit of grass, no malt. taste is extremely pungent, the nose was a little light compared to the taste, not upset whatsoever. it's so pungent, it's the best: Orange, orange, orange, mango, grass, so much juice, very little bit of malt. this beer is amazing, just behind DDH Melcher as my favorite trillium beer (aside from last year's Artaic release of course)."
Perfection
A: Beautiful. Opaque lemon color with frothy fine bubble head. Very hazy. Nice laces.
750 poured into tulip. 3/1/16
"This beer is an orange creamsicle infused with hops, hops, and more hops."
"Opaque tan yellow with a finger of creamy head that recedes to an ever present, thin blanket with an abundance of wobbly, round peaks of lacing."
"Bottle shared by Curran, thanks man."
"Bottled 03/01/16, so three weeks old. Tulip glass."
Look - As murky and hazy as a beer can get. Completely turbid. Looks like orange juice in the glass. 
"750 ml bottle. Pours milky yellow, two finger white head fades slowly, coating lace. Incredible aroma, like a combo of dank weed and citrusy fruit juice. Juice bomb taste but layered with dank weedy hops, earthy notes, all come together seamlessly. Dry finish with hint of peppery spice. Medium soft silky mouthfeel. This one is top notch."
"Bottle shared by Dave M, thanks for the opportunity. Turbid grapefruit juice with a small head. Big juicy fruity tropical pine aromas with a faint sweet bread deep underneath. Certainly nothing to look at, but tasty as hell."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Thanks, Shannon!"
"They don't make them much better than this. DD Congress is a straight pineapple juice bomb. Milky haze, mango, nectarine, peach orange rind, soft effervescent carbonation..100!!"
"Certainly on the turbid end of hazy beers. So much melon, pineapple, tangelo and grapefruit come through on both the aroma and palate. Classic Trillium with a pulpy, creamy, smooth mouthfeel. One of my new favorites."
Excellent beer. Preferred this to standard congress.
"I really liked the regular Congress St. , but the ddh version is out of sight! Great looking beer with perfect head, smells amazing and tastes perfect, one note let it warm up a little first,,it opens up as it gets closer to room temp"
500th BA rating! Excellent beer to reach that marker with.
A: Pours just an insanely cloudy grapefruit juice color with a half finger bone white head.
Look: Hop oils galore! Very turbid and pulpy. Hazy tan color with short white head.
"Nose is grapefruit, melon, pineapple with a hint of honey sweetness. "
Exceptional brew. For those that gave it a score of low 4's I would assume that you are the type to never find pleasure in life. Get a grip. If you can get your hands on some of the Congress ddh do not hesitate.
Drank on 3/17/2016 out of a Trillium chalice. This is from the early March batch.
Ben!!! Holy shit.
"My first of the DDH series from Trillium and it did not disappoint. Hands down one of the coolest looking beers once you get it in a glass, and the tropical flavors are on point. I know I'll probably catch some dirty looks for saying this, but I liked it better than Artaic."
"750ml bottle served in my Trillium tulip. Bottled on 3/1/2016. Pours a turbid, milky-orange hue with a loose, quarter inch, bright white head that dissipates towards the edges into a tight band. Nose expresses juicy orange notes as well as a hint of earthy/piney notes. Taste consistent with nose; however, the earthy/piney notes are more prominent in the flavor profile and coalesce with the juicy quality present in the nose. A light medicinal bitterness lingers between quaffs. Taste is light-medium in body with a carbonation shy of lively and an easy acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands towards the back of the mouth. Overall, the nose on this beer is exceptional; however, the juicy quality in the flavor profile is not as prominent as I would have liked to see; however, this IPA is quite good and will appeal to many no doubt."
Bomber poured into a snifter
"L: Totally opaque, not hazy. More of a soft orange, slighly milky looking with yellow undertones. Pours a nice white frothy head, leaves a light lace on the glass."
L: Soft peach and golden hues; hazy doesn't begin to describe the look of this beer - this is opaque. Generous fluffy white head
Poured from a 750mL glass into a Trillium Tulip glass. Thank you Steve for grabbing this for me. Bottled 4 days ago 3/1/16.
16oz can poured into a snifter.
750ml bottle dated 3/01/16
L - 5! 5! 5! Looks like thick but pulp-less OJ with a mango hue to it. Impressive to say the least out of the can. Yowza. 
"Canned 12/19/16, reviewed 12/23/16. Poured into my Trillium tulip."
"Poured from 750 mL into pint glass. It pours a hazy peach color with medium white head. This smell is off the charts; from apricot, pineapple, peach, mango, citrus, etc. The flavor is on the same page as the smell; really juicy! Overall great beer and would definitely try to get again, cheers!"
"Another amazing beer by Trillium. Seriously this stuff is great. It pours like an unripe orange juice, yellowish orange and super hazy. Smell hits you right away with Tropical fruitiness. Taste follows perfectly with a touch of bitterness at the end. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a cloudy peach orange that reminds me of a pastel orange juice. It looks super juicy. The nose is not as big as other Trillium brews like Artaic but it is still fantastic with citrus fruits, orange and tropical fruits/melon in the back end. The beer itself is juicy and super easy to drink. I easily went through my first glass in no time. Really refreshing with flavors of orange peel, orange juice, melon and finished with a very soft restrained bitterness."
"Best IPA out there IMO. Pours cloudy yellow/orange, the citrus aroma is unreal."
"Big hoppiness all over this one with big, fresh, whifs of floral notes. Each swallow is a just fresh, hops. Bright yellow body with white head that lasts and lasts. Really glad we had this!"
Thanks to GRG1313 for sharing this one at his tasting.
"Unbelievable IPA. Amazing look, smell and feel. Worth all the hype and more."
"this phenomenal and rare beer comes to me by great generous courtesy of philbolt, a fellow BA from across the country that was far too kind with his access to cool beer that before now only existed in my dreams. thanks new friend! this is a hectic brew, totally east coast. looks like a vermont one with its hazy beige color, thick and yeasty looking, lovely head on it, but man, this is cloudy and dense beyond the level of even the other east coast monsters, almost looks less refined, intense, no light passing through this milky brew. the smell is its best feature, i wish they said which hops were used, but i can only stab at that, its super floral and citrusy both, short of tropical, but i get fresh cut pineapple, tangerine, even lemongrass in here. the malt base is odd. seems like it almost has to be wheat centered, but the texture isnt there all the way, and its hard to pick out what else is in here, maybe oats with all this density. it has a remarkable hop flavor to it too, scaled back just a little from the smell, but its pungent and different, and taste like something hill farmstead would make, or has made. the process here is very cool, and i immediately want to know more. i think it came through just a bit heavy for perfection, yeasty and really viscous for the style, and where it flatters some of its peers, its overdone here by a small margin that makes it a slower drinker and a weird one all in all. very awesome to taste this beer ahead of my trip to boston next week where i will surely get my hands on some more of their stuff, and its really exciting to get to taste beer like this out here. thanks again philbolt, looking forward to sharing a beer with you in real life!"
actually love the look of this. great beer!
"bottle dated 6/6, just shy of a month...enjoyed from a trillium mini snifter."
"Bomber, dated 6/6/15. Thanks Patrick!"
"Look: Opaque and turbid. The body looks like the cheap pineapple juice out of a can. Or you could call it a peachy body. The coolest looking body in a beer I have seen. No movement, nothing, just stillness. The white head is fine, dense, fluffy, and sticky, . Impressive. "
"Even before pouring you can see how insane this beer looks, it practically glows through the brown glass. Once in the glass it is closer to orange juice than beer. This is the hoppiest beer I've ever come across, the tropical aromas just fly out of the glass. The taste is 100% american hops with massive tropical notes. Full bodied it is exceedingly smooth for such a hop bomb. Simply, this is the best IPA I've ever had."
Outstanding beer from Trillium. Showing that East Coast Hops can be the best. From the look to the nose to the taste it's so very good.
"The perfect beer! Perfect balance of hops, malt, aroma, juice, abv. You name it, this has it."
"Overall it was a good beer. The smell was great as soon as I popped the bottle, however I was a little let down with the taste. Maybe my expectations were off but it just didn't hold up next to some of the other NE ipa's I have had recently. Obviously we are all spoiled on here in terms of having great beers 1 after another, so im sure this is just another case of splitting hairs but at the end of the day this wouldn't crack my top 10 ipa's"
"domn son, this is amazing! looks like straight up orange/pineapple juice with pulp!"
Stunning. One of the best things I have ever smelled.
I very much enjoy Congress St but the dry hopping came across as too herbal and tastes like fresh mint. Personally prefer the base beer but happy to see this brewery getting so much praise.
Absolutely delicious. Mango citrus nose. Pours like OJ. Tropical flavors of orange mango and pineapple with a solid hop bitterness to finish. Nice carbonation
Bottled on 6-6-15; drank on 6-7-15
purchased from trillium. bottle date 060615. 
"Pours cloudy, such a pale orange it's almost white. Three finger head. Smells of tropical citrus and pine. Taste is clean and dry and juicy. Unquestionably hoppy. Tropical taste to go along with the tropical aroma. Peppery feeling in the tongue. Aftertaste is a mix of bitter and a tropical drink. Really great and fun IPA."
Very good but not as fabulous as DDH sleeper Or DDH Melcher
"This is basically Congress Street with double the hops...adds a more piney/prickly to the tongue hop component. Bravo! Crisp mouthfeel, dry finish combined with a punch of fresh hops to your palate!"
"042015. The definition of unfiltered. You could see it in the bottle before pouring. Beautiful orange gold color with a massive white head. Such an amazing bouquet of fresh, ripe tropical fruit, flowers, hops, a bit of sap and pine. But this is mostly fresh mango and pineapple. Same with the flavor/taste. I wish this bottle would never end. Feel is slightly dry and bitter but absurdly drinkable. Hop juice is what this is. If you didn't know any better, you would drink this until passing out thinking it was not beer. Top notch quality stuff. Up there with the best ""New England IPAs"" (which is dominating the craft beer scene at the moment) and has the same qualities as Hill Farmstead. Price is a bit steep at $12 for a 750ml but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Thanks to judkinst again! YDM!"
Cloudy Citrus Mango Monster. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had.
Had this freshly bottled 2 weeks ago. Thought the extra dry hopping added a too fruity aroma that just wasn't for me. I'll take the plain old Congress Street.
Smells like a pine tree forest. Super cloudy body. Pretty tasty beer overall though.
Right up there if not better then the Regular Congress St. Great beer.. I'll put this beer up with any beer out there
"As others have said, this beer is so hazy that if you were otherwise unfamiliar with Trillium you just might think there was something wrong with it. The unbelievable smell quickly kicks that notion to the curb though. This is right in the sweet zone of that ""Vermont Nose"" that is just about my favorite thing going in beer at the moment. Lots of fruit (mango/pineapple is how I think of this - though you could probably find a whiff of just about any tropical fruit if worked at it a bit) as well as very fresh, green, cannibis tinged hops. The taste is much more the latter than the former. "
unreal stuff here.. Hazey and dank.. just epic- had a recent batch. the mouthfeel is unreal- Trillium makes the best Hoppy beers in the world. This is another home run
"Pours a hazy, yellow with a nice carbonation. Smell is of mango and citrus. Tastes of mango and pineapple with a nice hop resin pine taste also. Great mouth feel. It gets so hard to rate Trillium beers as they are all so good in their own way but all so tasty. An awesome beer again."
"WOW, this beer is world class. Right up there with the best of the best I've ever had. Gotta love that haziness of this beer, its like a hop smoothie."
"Probably the cloudiest, haziest pour I've experienced from an IPA thus far but damn good beer for sure!"
"Incredibly murky, orange/amber brew. Mediocre head with decent retention. Honestly, not a very inviting appearance."
"Smell and taste are pineapple, mango, apricot/peach and possible subtle kiwi. Juicy, sweet tropical citrus. Feel is a little oily."
"OJ/Mango juice. Bottled on 3/3, cloudy as all hell, pillowy, fluffy and glorious. Even with the double dry hop, this beer is super balanced. Just another incredible offering from Trillium."
"Beautiful hop aroma,pleasant citrus, juicy, great overall flavor. Excellent beer all the way around."
"L: The best I have ever seen, a bright orange glow"
"A: Hazy/cloudy, bright yellow/light peach like in color with a foamy white head."
Smell is beautiful pine and tropical blended together. Heavenly. Feel is luxurious and smooth. Spectacular.
Slightly sweet yet equally bitter
Bottle picked up last night at Craft Beer Cellar in Belmont
Peach. Guava. Pineapple. Loads of tropical fruit on the nose of this beer. The body is soft. Juicy nose is carried into the flavor of the beer with only a hint of bitterness.
"The beer pours some bubbly white head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer leaves a lot of lacing. The beer itself is a hazy yellow with some very light orange notes. The beer smell has some very strong citrus fruits with a hint of pine and resine. The citrus notes consist of lemon and orange and hints of papaya. No malt notes to speak of. The beer taste is different than the smell and very juicy. The hops are very strong with mainly orange and pine notes with the other citrus notes being very subtle and dominated by the orange and pine. Bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but very soft and bubbly and very refreshing despite the carbonation. Overall, a fantastic beer from Trillium and worth getting. This has to be the best offering overall."
"A - Two fingers of dense, white head. Hazy body the color of a blend of pulpy OJ and grapefruit juice. Great lacing."
750ml bottle. Poured into a Cigar City snifter 9/5/2014.
"16oz can, purchased at the brewery. Perhaps one of the most expensive 4-pack of 16oz cans I have bought. "
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Appearance - Hazy golden brew with tangerine tint. Frothy head, and just looks hoppy"
750 mL bottle purchased at Trillium. Poured into a HF wine glass at 39F
Very good. Improves upon an equally great Congress street.
Perfect IPA. Quite a treat.
"Juicy, tropical fruit forward. Slight biscuit malt backbone. Really delicious........................................................................"
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a pint glass, bottled yesterday. My first impression of this was ""liquid gold"" and ""Trillium has knocked this one out of the park"". Super fresh, super tasty, perfect mouthfeel, perfect head - just doesn't get much better. Note that the optimal temperature for this liquid gold is just a few degrees below typical refrigerator temp."
"Double Dry hopped Congress Street...can it improve upon an exceptional base beer? It pours a turbid yellowish color. Well-set head is white and frothy. Head leaves bubbly lacing remnants. Nose is dominated by tropical fruit hops and I am far from surprised. Fruit-hop perfume. Mango, pineapple and peaches in the nose. Some mild green onion (which I pick up a lot in Trillium's beer and which I love). Sweet citrus flesh, mango and even some pear. The flavor is dominated, again, by wet, ripe, juicy, fruity, hoppiness. Squishy pineapple and juicy melons. Some grass and soft green onion. Peach and apricot. Fruit smoothie. Pale malt cushion. Dry, not overly bitter finish, yet the bitterness, albeit it modest does linger. Soft carbonation. Hop oils. Almost a cask-esque feel. Trillium's new releases have been an exhilarating experience. Very happy I bought four of these. Long live the brewers in Fort Point!"
"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a willibecher. This was bottled yesterday, and picked up from the brewery an hour ago."
Just so smooth.
"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a custom Sam Adams pint taster; canned on 9/14/18, code SO FRESH AND SO GGGREENNN."
"Picked-up four cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton two weeks ago for $4.55 per can. This is my 17th brew from these guys. Drank 1st 3 right out of can, poured last one into glass, which I think improved the taste. Super thick & creamy, never seen a beer like it in a glass. Yummy."
"Think I prefer the OG, this one lacked the bitterness to provide the balance the original beer Green has. It's splitting hairs, but somethimes you gotta split hairs."
A: hazy as shit. Burnt orange color with a silky white head
"If Green was a milkshake, it would be this beer. It's almost too thick feeling, but tastes ridiculous. More pineapple than on Green and slightly less bitterness (not that Green is very bitter). This beer is a whole different experience to almost anything out there. "
"Pours hazy, orange-brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is big pineapple with starfruit, bitter orange juice, and slight guava. Heavy bodied, low carbonation, sweet start with slightly bitter finish. This is a creamier/ heavier bodied version of Green with orange juice bitterness at the finish. The heavier body really adds to the beer. Makes me want regular Green to compare it to. An amazing IPA. Green amplified in all the right ways. One of the best ipas I have had."
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a fairly strong citrus with a little hops. Taste is also a very nice and prominent citrus.
Preferred Very Green
"Can’t get a clear reading on the stamp on the bottom of the can, so nevermind."
12 oz sample at brewery. 
Had on tap at the brewery earlier this evening. To be completely honest: it’s the best hoppy beer I’ve ever had. Bar NONE. Seriously like Green or Very Green but better (which I didn’t think was possible). Perfection.
L: Warm apricot and peach hues with a frothy white head and ample lacing
"Look: Yellow orange color, lighter side, completly hazy with no floaters. "

"Look: thick 1.5 inch creamy head with staying power. Yellow orange color, lighter side, completly hazy with no floaters. "
"L - about time. Pours a thick, milkshake haze. Classic Green. A tad darker, probably on account of all those goddamn hops. Slightly pinkish like frozen peach juice. Shiny, oily head. "
Shared with JLindros.
"Canned 6/09/18, big thanks to rudzud"
"I was fortunate enough to stumble onto this silent allotment of 2 cans on release day, enjoyed later that night in my gold tulip. Huge foam head that builds 3 finders, lingers for about 10 minutes, very dense. Massive sweet aroma and taste from the malts, but the hops are a perfect balance, giving the brew unfathomable amounts of tropical fruit and juicy goodness. This is definitely one of the best from Tree House, so thankful I was able to try it. I enjoyed this over an hour or so, flavors become more intense and does not acquire any bitterness or off tastes."
Wow.
Canned 6/8/18. Reviewed 6/9/18.
"Pours a bold chilled orange/white haze with a lingering two finger head of tight foam bubbles. Smells like Tree House signature Green-family: bright citrus galaxy and soft mellow malts. Rainwater, sherbet, and tang aromas. Taste is a blast of refreshing bright galaxy, super smooth and juicy that transitions right into bitter, crisp and dry. Quite hoppy at the end. Lush and soft mouthfeel. This fits in right at home with Very Green and maybe the only at-first-glance difference is just how hoppy it finishes. Much closer to a DIPA. Gggreennn holds its own with all those ""rare release"" Tree House IPA's everyone goes nuts over. Yes, it's *another* limited Tree House IPA we all knew would be great. Yes, it's *another* hype beer that anyone other than those trying to ""off-meta"" or ""edgy"" was going to praise. But damn... Tree House can back-up their reputation. This is another very good beer."
Canned 19 days ago. 
A-Pours a hazy orange amber color with a nice head and lacing
200% opaque dark orange mango and carrot puree with a tall off-white foam that settles to a frothy film and a lumpy collar leaving coral lace.
"Cloudy yellow with two fingers of creamy, off-white head. The head sticks around for a good while and leaves heavy lacing."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of pineapple, melon, kumquat, and tangerine. It tastes of pineapple, lemon, tangerine, and melon. The feel is light, and smooth. A nice ipa from Hill Farmstead."
"06/2014 - Massive pine, some tropical fruit, grassy aromas; flavorful, clean, bitter, sharp hoppiness all over the palate; light bitterness, with some more tropical fruit on the finish."
From growler (under 2 weeks). Bright yellow-orange completely opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam and carbonation upon aggressive pour. Very citrus and tropical aromaticity. Loads of citrus fruit flavors. Sweeter taste. Creamy mouthfeel and little bit of a different finish than your typical NE IPA (different from Tree House and Trillium). Hard to describe but it works well and balances the citrus fruitiness.
Poured from a 12 ounce can into a wine glass.
"First IPA from HF. Absolutely fantastic beer. Super juicy but there is a great balance of bitterness. It pours super, orange-yellow with lots of lacing. It’s creamy and delicious. Almost impossible to tell this is a double. One of the best IPAs I’ve had this year"
7/30/18
Can: Poured a bright hazy yellow color ale with a nice large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh floral undertones notes of citrusy and light tropical notes with dank herbal notes and subtle residual sugar notes. Taste is a great mix of dank herbal nots with superb floral undertones notes of citrus and tropical fruits with right amount of residual sugar. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid IPA that I wish I could have access to on a regular basis.
"Thanks to jhavs for this one. canned on 3/12/18, drink by date of 4/23/18. Hmm, only good for 5 weeks? Seems sorta sketchy. 12oz can poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid orange color with about 1/4 inch of white head that had low retention, but good lacing."
"A bit dank! Tropical, sweet, juicy, and delicious. This is legendary for a reason."
"Look: orange juice, pure hazy orange juice "
"Cloudy yellow/light gold pour, larger puffy head, loads of lacing, good head retention. Resinous aroma, light pine, tropical fruit, grapefruit, grass. Taste: Quite hoppy, grapefruit, tropical fruit, dank, hop resin, lighter caramel malt sweetness. Medium body with fairly soft carbonation."
3/24/2018
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a significant hoppy citrus that is very appealing. Taste is a bitter hoppy citrus that is a great blend and balance.
Appearance: Arrives hazy and honey colored with an impressive capping; clumpy lacing all the way down
Can received in trade
"This is a Galaxy+Citra combo. Incredible. Flavor is insane, I wish I'd gotten more growlers of this after trying it. Has that same HF character to the whole beer."
"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. About three weeks old, the hop aroma is still incredible. Smell is a good mix of Citra and Galaxy hops with notes of orange pureé/tangerine (floral), pineapple, and some grass/earthy flavors. Taste follows the nose but is not quite as pleasant overall with some interesting bitterness. It is relatively dry with a touch of honeysuckle sweetness. There is great creamy body up front with a refreshing and smooth finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full in body with relatively low carbonation."
"The pour is a grapefruit milkshake, pale orange, murky, thick, and a light tan head. Aromas are all citrus - oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, pineapple. I am bouncing in my chair."
Poured from a 12 oz can into a Fiddlehead Teku glass. Super fresh purchased at the brewery.
Very brite and the citrus notes are very nice on the back end. I've had this several times and without a doubt one of my all time favorites .
750ml swing top bottle poured into a tulip glass filled on 7/29
"On tap at Doc Ponds. Pours a hazy burnt orange with 2 inches of frothy head. Tons of lacing. Nose is lots of grapefruit and tropical fruits. Lime and pine. The taste is loads of tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, guava, grapefruit and lime. Some stone fruits as well. Slightly dank finish with more tropical fruits. Some alcohol heat. Oily mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, awesome."
"Poured into a flared tulip, the appearance was a cloudy/hazy burnt orange color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace. Moderate lace speckles the glass nicely. The aroma starts off with a beautiful balance between the mango sweetness, somewhat tropical and then flowing into a nice rind-like citrusy bitter grip. Sweet onion starting to come out. The flavor yields to the bitter side first but very quick, and then dries up with the rind, full and pith-like with a super nice juicy to bitter balance rolling into a semi-sticky aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great balance of sipping to sessionable sort of bittersweet feel to it. Good level of carbonation. Overall, extremely nice DIPA that I would love to have again."
Best beer I've ever had on tap.
"Nice hay colored DIPA, lots of good hop aroma and tropical fruit aromas. Really well made beer, clean, balanced and tons of hops. HF makes classic hop beers so well"
"Poured an opaque yellow/orange color with a fingers worth of bubbly white head. The nose had a lot of citrus fruit with pine and spices. The flavor has a ton of citrus fruit with a splash of tropical fruit, earthiness, and finishes with the slightest bit of pine. The feel is medium, well carbonated, and slightly resinous. This beer is outstanding! Well worth all the praise it gets and I will definitely seek it out again."
"Creamy yellow orange look. Smell is fresh citrus hops, taste is juicy and smooth like a cloud in your mouth, no alcohol taste at all. Very nice color, smell is perfect and taste is even better."
Tap pour into tulip. Smaller head with minimal retention and nice medium sticky lacing. Aroma is assertively citrus and dank tropical fruit. Flavor follows and is beautifully balanced with the nice malty background. Delightful fluffy mouthfeel and no hint of the alcohol. This beer is a winner
"Finally able to track this thing down and had massive expectations.. double citra (when fresh) is one of my all time favorite beers that I've ever had the pleasure to sip on so when they describe this and double citra meets double galaxy - you know it's gonna be an instant favorite. ""when fresh"" as mentioned above is important as I live in New Mexico and have only ever been able to try HF hops through the means of trading and I very rarely am able to try them within the recommended drink by date that HF prints on their tags. I had an incredible pour of double citra the first time I got to it, the next was from a growler that had a marked ""drink by"" date from a 8 days prior (so probably 13 day old growler by that time)... and was really bad. So in my experience, the hoppy beers in growlers from HF fall off extremely fast.... that said, if you are lucky enough to enjoy any of their hoppy beers within the recommended time, I envy you. HF is the best in my opinion. Rant over, now lets drink:"
"Hazy and golden, almost apricot, fluffy head. Smell is citrus, sweet orange, and warm, fruity, sweetness. Feel is... incredible. Light carbonation that spreads evenly across the sip, so smooth and creamy... amazing. Taste is barely bitter, maybe some rind on the back. Pineapple, orange, almost vanilla sweetness... wow."
Picked up 750ML growler in trade. 
"On draft at Three Penny Taproom, $7.50 for 8 oz (?) pour. Appearance is a murky, yellow-orange, with a tall, thick, creamy head that coats the glass. Aroma is a medley of tropical fruits with a hint of herbal/spice hops, not super aromatic. Taste is delicious. Mango, pineapple, orange, a hint of spice, a soft, muted bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is about perfect. Overall, an incredible DIPA, a little pricey, but glad I had it."
Had at Armsby Abby...so freaking good - will wrote more to my 2 followers later
"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 11/02/16. Served in a tulip."
"damn. as the description implies, think legendary status similar to double citra and double galaxy. beautiful appearance, incredible fluffy mouthfeel, ridiculously big and simultaneously perfectly balanced and delicate. pulpy OJ, pithy grapefruit, soft peach and ripe mellow lead the charge of massive juicy notes, hint of pineapple in there too. but its definitely well matched with soft bready notes and some green herbal quality, nice mellow grapefruit and pine provides a bite of bitterness on the finish."
"Straight from a growler I picked up at the brewery on October 19, 2016 and drank that night. "
On-draught @ Torst in Brooklyn at $13 per 14oz pour.

Golden sunset orange.
"If I want a glass of tropical fruit nectar, I'll grab a bottle of East Coast IPA... that's the direction this style is headed. For better or worse, it takes some getting used to. Once I got used to it, I found myself liking it more and more. "
"On tap at CBC 2016 - day 2. Peaches, oranges, lemons, some pineapple, on top of a nice malty sweet blanket. An excellent IPA."
"From the growler obtained at the brewery on August 20, 2016. Sampled the next day. "
"Wow! Just wow! My favorite Hill Farmstead beer. Possibly my favorite beer of all time. Although, at the time of writing this, I've still yet to have any of the Treehouse IPA's. "

"Cloudy yellow, white head."
"Fuck. This beer in my glass in Portland. HOW? Flip top 750 opens with a hiss, nice frothy head, beautiful color, the perfect, I mean perfect haze, the orange, the amber, the lemon rind. Aroma is amazing citrus, some pine, some melon some stone fruit. The flavor, soft up front, ripe citrus, grapefruit, melon. Crisp and clean mouthfeel with just that bit of pucker holding on to remind you that this is incredible. One of the best things I have ever tasted."
had this beer from growler about a week old. color and look is nice hazy hill farmstead. nose is great. taste is tropical heaven. had before susan. much better with more flavor. hill farmstead is awsome
"Just Perfect. My favorite hoppy beer. So refined and balanced. Perfect malt backbone, perfect bitterness."
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
Poured out as a cloudy golden color with a nice white head on top. Good retention and lacing. The smell is spewing tropical aromas and it's really enticing. The taste is very hoppy but also has a good amount of malt in there too. Overall the beer is excellent.
"On Tap at Armsby Abbey. That same amazingly smooth mouthfeel that most HF IPAs have. Juicy as hell, soft peach notes, perfect amount of bitterness. Definitely one of my favorite HF IPAs."
Wow. No time for a real review but one of my favorite IPAs and one of the best from HF. Period.
Big citrus. Cloudy and beautiful. Smooth - hides the ABV. Another fantastic beer from HF. Need more.
"I'm blown away by this beer. Hands down, my vote for best beer in the world. It's perfect!"
my fav Hill Farm Hops to date... so complex and so refined all in one beer.. the flavors are amazing citrus and everything around this beer is on point..
On draft at Three Penny Taproom. Served in tulip.
Growler procured from the source from a good friend.
"Look: Straw yellow with hints of amber; totally cloudy, completely opaque. Pours with a thick, 2 finger, white cloud-like head that dies down very slowly leaving a thick, uneven layer of foam on the surface of the beer and large amounts of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Perfect!"
"Growler from the brewery consumed a day or two after filling. Cloudy, hazy orange. Aroma is bursting with tropical hops. the flavor is the same. Truly a top notch IPA."
Superb
"Maybe the best Hill DIPA I have ever had. It's tropical fruit meets pine. Soft mouth feel, very clean, lingering clean hop flavor. I can't say enough about how good this beer is."
"Drank on tap at The Well in Brooklyn , NY "
"Grower fill. One of the cleanest, fruitiest IIPAs I've ever had. Honestly I think the mouth feel is what really sets this IIPA apart. Fresh SoS and Dinner may be 'cleaner' but don't come near the feel of S&S #4."
Had a glass at the Dive Bar in Worcester. Double citre + double galaxy = amazing. Amazing citrus nose and taste with a creamy finish. Excellent balance while providing an amazing hop bite. One of my favorite beers ever....
"If double citra was pretty much the perfect ipa, then this is with the addition of the galaxy hops. I wish the growler never ran out of this beer. Im hooked on these HF pale ales!!"
Not a terribly difficult beer to review! Everyhting about it is world class.
A: An opaque orange. Bubbly white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. 
L: a hazy orange with a
"Beautiful orange like a mellow sunset in the glass. Classic HF citrus nose, not unlike Double Citra. Huge citrus flavors on this one. Just perfect balance again for a hoppy beer. Can't go wrong here."
The beer comes in an opaque gorgeously sunset golden orange.
"Pours cloudy hazy orange with a one finger head. Smells of orange and citrus rind with a lighter hop aroma. Taste is bright orange and citrus with a crisp bitter finish. Nice bitterness on the back-end with a peppery mouth-feel. The citrus washes out with a hoppy bitter feel stays for a bit. Really, really excellent showing from Hill Farmstead. This is world class."
Wow! Now THIS is the kind if IIPA I was expecting based on the universal love of Hill. #4 is the real deal! I found myself halfway through the glass before even realizing it. Dangerous at 8%. I wish this was more readily available as it's one of the best IIPA's around.
"Drank on tap at Armsby Abbey, Worcester, MA"
Growler.
"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled a couple hours ago"
L: Hazy orange body with a thick white head and nearly opaque lacing.
"The last of my HF growlers, and hopefully the best. 750 ml growler into a tulip."
"L- excellent golden color, almost as if it glows. Very hazy, completely opaque. Two finger fluffy white head."
"Pours a very hazy dark banana colored body, huge foam that slathers the side and takes its time. Ultimate lush fruit in aroma and flavor. I get peaches but there are other overripe fruit flavors. Kind of like pureed fruit a bit. Killed a 750ml in no time, dangerously drinkable and delicious."
Great beer! Had it in a growler about a month after filling and still was very very tasty. Good hop flavor and creamy IPA look. Really solid beer that I would drink again and again
"I've had this on tap at a few locations and then of course in a take home growler. Like most of HFS beers, it's deceptively good. Another shining example of Vermont's fine IPA's. Golden color, hazy pour with a nice light white head upon pouring. Trade for it if you can!"
Finally got to enjoy some Hill Farmstead brews this weekend while up in VT. While some of the local brews left me a little dissappointed every brew I tried from HF was amazing. One was better than the other and this one was right at the top. Not the best looking brew I've had but one of the most tasty. Strong flavor and keeps on coming till the end. Wonderful brew thats worth seeking out.
Absolutely awesome beer. 
On tap at the Hill and poured from growler.
Ridiculous!!!! Tons of grapefruit and citrus on the palate and nose!! Killer!!!
"A - Hazy golden-orange body, essentially translucent. Big, persistent white head, big lacing."
"Poured from a 750mlk growler 2 days after it was filled. This was yet another amazing IPA from HF. I had it the day after Double Citra and found many of the same notes (the sweet, ripe citrus and tropical notes in the nose and taste) but also with a bitmore of a bittering hop bit in the finish. These guys have the Midas Touch right now!"
Cant get this beer down.. Great beer but very unique to other beers..
"2l growler. Cloudy light yellow. Very heavy on the grapefruit, yet light. Kinda tastes like grapefruit juice pulp and water. Subtile and easy drinking. Pretty good, but one of my least favorite HF IPAs."
This is an excellent beer. 
A-pale golden orange color with a nice white head and good lacing
My favorite Double IPA to date. I've had all the Top ones other than King Sue and Society & Solitude #5.
"Pours a light tangerine hue with a hazy clarity and a bright white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy slick. Nose is a bit subdued - citrus zest and a hint of spice and sweet citrus towards the back. Taste follows nose - even and drinkable with a little rind at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, but closer to light, with an even, mild carbonation. All and all, a dangerously drinkable beer, but not my favorite hoppy offering from HF."
"Pour is extremely cloudy pale orange with lots of tight white head that lingers. Nose has a husky grain, a musky hop, and tons of citrus. Extremely bright. Flavor follows suit, bright, tons of citrus in back, stronger grain presence, very musky citra hop, moderate bitterness, really soft feel with great carb. Bitterness lingers slightly through the finish."
"Probably the best DIPA I have ever had. Pure tropical deliciousness, so damn juicy. Would drink this every day if I could. Unseats S&S 6 as my favorite HF hop bomb. Need more."
A truly epic DIPA.
Poured from a 750 mL growler into an enlarged snifter. This was filled at the brewery a week ago today.
"Best mouthfeel of an IPA, soft and pillowy with a bitterness bite that ends with dryness and sweetness. Quite a treat- Hop Juice."
"Hazy, unfiltered, tropical, low carbonation and lacing. Delicious member of the S&S line."
Poured from a 750mL growler into a Hill Farmstead Stemmed balloon glass. Bottled yesterday at the brewery.
"Reviewed from notes, fresh growler shared by Liam."
"Amazing beer, try it if you ever have the chance."
"Tasted on tap at Prohibition Pig. Bright and hazy. The aroma is mainly dank citra with earthy, floral, pungent undertones from the galaxy. Taste isn't overly complex with both featured hops dominating. Very drinkable, another good DIPA from Hill Farmstead."
750ml growler split into 2 HF wine stems.
I do not say this lightly... but this beer is perfect. It is absolutely perfect. I am not usually a fan of hoppy beers or IPAs in general. 
"Had on tap, served in a snifter. Orange and yellow hued body, leaning toward a straw-colored yellow. Fluffy white head; lacing in spades. Nose of citrus and tropical fruits, a little dankness underneath it all. Taste follows the nose, with an ever-so-slight presence of alcohol heat. A godly mouthfeel. Very pleasant to drink. Hill Farmstead is making it hard on everyone else to create good IPAs."
"Pours a nice, frothy snow-white head. Retention is good, and very nice long lines of lacing persist. Brew is a pulpy, almost completely opaque light orange color."
Hazy with a nice light orange color. 
"I've heard a lot about Hill Farmstead and the beers that I've had from Hill Farmstead prior to this have been great to oh my god fantastic. I was in Vermont for the weekend and I have Everett, Edward, and Walden. While I though all were good, only Everett was amazing to me. Now, I barely got three growlers of HFS at the brewery because I overlooked the fact that they were cash only. Anyway, I got three smaller growlers and I'll review Susan and Abner when I have then. "
Poured from a fresh growler (48hrs) into a modified tulip glass.

750ml Flip-top opened on 10.9.13
Thanks to Bobby for this one. Enjoyed around the fire with family while camping...can't think of a better place to consume. Nice fluffy head is all can say for appearance as this was consumed at night out of a plastic cup. Hoppy nose hints at what is to come. Really actually pretty balanced once it hits the mouth with bitter hops up front kept in line with medium body malt goodness. Enjoyed this beer immensely if not for the great taste but the company and atmosphere alone.
Shaun's S&S #4 is the best beer I've ever had from HF.
"A: Glowing golden yellow-orange. Creamy head is large n in charge. Spotty lace and a good 1/4"" retention once the head fades."
"Unclear orange tinted yellow color with a big, frothy head that fills up the rest of the glass and then some. Heavy, juicy, fruity aromas...grapefruit, orange, mango, peach, and pineapple. Fresh, floral hop cones galore. Huge tropical fruit presence on the tongue. Really juicy, authentic, pulpy citrus just like I've experienced from all of the HF beers I've tried thus far, but also kiwi, peach, passion fruit, and melon all over a sticky bed of pine needles. Medium-plus bodied, almost chewy in nature as it begs to be swished around. Drying and bitter, but delightfully smooth and dangerously drinkable. Oh man...they harness the pure flavor and aromas of the hops so well. Fantastic!"
"750mL flip-top thanks to DoctorB2B. Full haze, glowing peach pour. Medium white foam with delicate lacing. Fresh peach and butterscotch nose with mild salt, sweat, and thick melon sorbet. Taste is fresh and juicy with a pretty hefty white alcohol Gin bite. Long, herbal sage and white pepper finish. Alcohol is apparent, but the overall experience is juicy, fresh, and soft. Really nice as always. Amazingly quenching, soft palate that comes off as mango, white grapefruit sorbet. One of my favorite DIPAs ever."
"Growler from 9-18-13, drank on 9-29-13. Thanks to DonFrap for snagging this one for me!"
"A - Served on tap at the Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. The beer arrived in a Hill Farmstead wine glass with a creamy two-finger head and a color that is difficult to describe. It's something of a muted orange with a golden glow. The beer is uniformly cloudy. It almost looks like a mango smoothy. Can't wait to try it."
Ok double galaxy meets double citra here we go.
"Beer pours that of any HF IPA I've tasted. It's a light, hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. It has the same mysterious HF glow. "
"Pours a light yellow/gold color with a finger of near white head, great lacing and retention. Amazing citrusy semi sweet flavors. Lighter citrus notes, reminiscent of pineapple and mango. Ideal drink ability, medium bodied, semi sticky but decent carbonation and bitter notes make this a very refreshing beer. My favorite HF to date."
75cl growler generously shared by Doug. Poured into a Cantillon wine glass today 9/14/2013 during our One Ear Anniversary tasting.
SS#4 750ml poured into a HF stem
"Bursting with tropical fruit juice flavors, very balanced bitterness and creamy mouthfeel."
"Growler filled 8/31, consumed 9/6."
750ml growler poured into a Kane snifter.
"Reviewing Society & Solitude #4 from Hill Farmstead. This might be my favorite IPA that they make, which is to say a lot since Shawn Hill makes some of the best IPA out there. "
"Huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing this one. Served in Hill Farmstead stemware. Pours a moderate peach color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing. Nose has heavy citrus and tropical notes. Mango big in the flavor, followed by heavy bitterness. Touch of passion fruit. Really bitter, but still crushable. I would have liked a little less on that for more focus on the flavor blend of Citra and Galaxy."
Notes from a few months ago; served on-tap in New York City.
"Perfect summertime brew, pours a near clear orange gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has an outstanding combination of slightly sweet citrus with slightly bitter pine backed by grass. Flavor has citrus up front that transitions to grapefruit and pine with a hint of chive, backed by light grain. Love this one!"
Thanks LambicKing!
Served from a 750ml growler into a Founders tulip. Thanks to Cam (UrbanCaver) for hooking me up!
"Huge thanks to Mike for sharing this growler. Pours cloudy golden amber hue with marshmellow off white head. Aroma has a nice mix of citrus bitter hops with a touch of pine. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor has upfront citrus tart note, then the finish has a strong and somewhat astringent hop bite. It lets you know that its a double. Even though it doesn’t really taste like a double. Its very deceiving. Thanks again Mike."
Huge thanks to the ever-generous kingkong for the growler. Shared with friends and poured into a Duvel tulip.
"750ml growler opened on September 4, 2012. I'm fearful for the day when a google search of ""Society & Solitude"" brings up Hill Farmstead beers instead of Emerson, but according to Greg Currie, literature can't give us insight into the mind and its workings anyways, so I drink Hill Farmstead when I could be reading Emerson. "
On tap at Positive Pie. Served out of a Hill Farmstead snifter. Reviewed from notes. 
Huge thanks to GrumpyOldTroll for the share! Notes from 8/29.
Presentation: 64 oz. screwtop growler filled on Saturday at the brewery. Keep chilled since being filled. Poured into a pint glass and enjoyed.
"I drank this at Matt's birthday tasting last night. Thanks for sharing this, Matt!"
"On tap at Farmmhouse in Burlington, VT. Amazing DIPA. Prevalent fresh delicious hops as always from Hill Farmstead."
Poured from growler taken from brewery in less than 18 hour period poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.
I made the pilgrimage to the Hill Farmstead Brewery in early August and picked up a 2 liter growler of this particularly fruity Imperial IPA brewed with Citra and Galaxy hops. Why 2 liters? Let's just say I couldn't resist. Beer was poured from the growler into my St. Bernardus chalice. Review is from notes. 
Growler
8/17/2012
"Enjoyed on tap at the Black Back Pub. A dirty blonde with a heavy dose of hops.A bit boozy in the finish. Decent to try,grassy,pine, fruity, a good use of citra without the cat pee effect.Fuller mouthfeel.Well malted, tokeep acidic edge away.An interesting beer."
"A - Pours a hazy tan/light to medium orange in color with a light head that dies quickly to an even white lacing ring, mellow carbonation."
Thanks to Deuane for grabbing me a growler of this one from the brewery.
Thank Keith!
750 mL growler poured into a Kate the Great snifter.
Hazy orange color with a nice bright white head. Aroma is fairly tropical with notes of mango and pineapple alongside a healthy dose of citrus zest. A light amount of malt notes in there as well. 
Growler into a snifter. Thanks go to Jonathan for picking up several growlers at the brewery and bringing them to my house to share. The brew pours a clouded golden yellow. A finger of off-white head fades leaving thick patches of lace sticking to the glass. A light swirl effortlessly brings a finger back to the surface.
"750ml Growler drank the same day and 1 week later. The fresh growler was more fruity and had more carbonation. I didn’t notice any major differences. Appearance: Deep opaque orange with thick white head. Aroma: Tropical fruits (orange, pinneaples) at first, then there is a rustic touch, wood, dank and grass. Taste: Very bitter, some spicy hops, a nice citrus tartness cuts through the bitterness and accentuates drinkability. Full bodied and very dry. Nice mix between rustic and fruity, quite complex. An average Hill Farmstead double IPA, which means a world class DIPA."
Thanks to Sean for sharing this growler. Served in a Hopleaf tulip.
1434th Review on BA
Big thanks to Jared (jlindros) for this bottle!
"A 750 ml growler poured into a tulip glass about two weeks after the growler was filled. Beer pours a hazy orange color, nothing visible through it, with a finger of soft frothy off white head. Head dissipates after a few minutes, leaving heavy lacing on the edge of the glass, to a collar of frothy bubbles. Really nice lacing."
Thanks!

750 ml growler purchased from the brewery 6 days ago. Poured in to HF stemmed tulip glass.
"Filled at the brewery, 10 day old batch. "
"At the time of this review this is #12 on the "" Top Beers - American Double / Imperial IPA"" list on beeradvocate.com. Served out of a growler (sorry Shaun...not really) into a Hill Farmstead tulip. Don't believe me? Check my twitter. This beer was really good. It was a little sweeter than I expected but a great mouthfeel and a nice finish. "
4 day old Growler brought back by TheSevenDuffs.

750ml growler thanks to Huhzubendah!
From 07/23/12 notes. Had on tap at The Pony Bar in New York at their UES location. Had 2 8 oz. pours of this because it was great.
"Made a special trip to the Pony Bar on the Upper East Side so I wouldn’t miss the very brief NYC appearance of this beer. Other kegs seemed to kick in a single afternoon and this one wound up lasting less than a day so it seems I wasn’t alone. Simply put this is as good as any highly hopped beer I’ve ever had. I don’t know how to rank these beers anymore; it simply is a matter of what hop combination one prefers at any given time, because this one and things like Abner, Pliny, Double Sunshine, the best of Alpine, Heady, the best of Surly and Three Floyds, etc. are all just fantastic. Holy crap there are some terrific hoppy beers being brewed these days."
Poured into a wine taster. The color is hazy straw to melon. There is a nice quarter inch head and lots of sticky lacing.
Poured into a tulip. This one pours a hazy orange with a small cap of white head. This settles down to a small ring of thin lace.
"Growler pour courtesy of Wowcoolman at Woodshop 7 held at Beachwood BBQ & Brewing in Long Beach, CA."
on Tap in a Chimay goblet
"Enjoyed on tap at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. "
"A-This beer is a murky, glowing amber color. Head is mild but it leaves a bunch of stringy lacing. "
Pours cloudy gold with a sticky 3 finger white head. Good retention and lacing.
"On tap at the Farmhouse, Burlington. Served in a tulip-y like glass."
Big thanks to ScottP for sending this one my way. Hill Farmstead makes the best hoppy beers out there - super excited for another one.
"This beer comes to me in a small snifter, a fact which I assume destroys a bit of the fluffy factor in the head. Pretty translucent golden orange color. Big aromas of tropical fruit, melon, tangerine. Its a tropical bonanza. Super fruity! Melon, tangerine, citrus, and waves of bitterness crash over my palate. Dry and medium bodied. I love these hop forward X2IPAs that aren't sticky or cloying. Sometimes I find X2IPAs can lean to far towards barleywine or strong ale. This one rocks."
Golden yellow body with a sticky white head.
Picked up a hard fought growler of this at the Hill Farmstead Civ 4 bottle release. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
This review is a based on culmination of notes taken from when I had the beer fresh on draft (at Positive Pie) and from a three day old growler filled at Hill Farmstead Brewery. 
"On tap at DeCicco's Brewster. Appearance is a hazy medium golden yellow with a puffy white head. Smell is not as strong as some other DIPAs at first but seems to be stronger after a taste, which is smooth and mellow without any alcohol aftertaste. Overall, another solid brew from Hill Farmstead. My only complaint is that I could not get a growler as they are not permitted to sell anything but in-store servings by the glass. Bummer. I see a road trip in the future to get growlers of HF beer at the brewery."
750ml HFB swing-top bottle filled at the brewery. 
First tried a sample of this at Drink Craft Beer's Summerfest last night in Sommerville. This review is from a 750ml growler filled at the bottle release earlier today. Poured into Hill Farmstead glass.
On draft at Blackback pub in Waterbury. I also drank a 750 mL of this last week.
On draft last night at Brouwerij Lane.
Poured a hazy orange with a small head. 
"On tap @ the farmhouse poured into a tulip. My first review in a while, but this was stand out enough to make male the effort."
"Just picked this up at the brewery yesterday. It was tasty then, and I'm sure it will be now."
"The lightly hazy golden amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1” fluffy white head that slowly recedes to eventually become a thin irregular island of foam on the surface and a ring around the glass while leaving scattered patches, some rings and a web of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates some small patches and legs of lacing."
A-Pours a nice slightly hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing
"Transparent golden in body with white giant head that stays. Aroma of dank ness, grass, pine, mint, citrus. Tastes of grass, pine, citrus, rind. Medium bodied with medium carbonation."
"Pours into a stemmed glass a lighter golden color with a billowing almost two finger rocky white head that takes it's time settling into a soapy mass leaving multiple chunks of lave behind.Mango,orange, and juicy papaya aromas,a hint of grapefruit rind to give it just a small amount of bitterness.Starts out juicy and bright on the palate with big orange and tangerine-like flavors then comes a mild grapefruit-like sharpness and a resin quality in a long lingering finish,just a fantastic hop profile.I thought this would be just a juicy NEIPA wich is not a bad thing but the hop profile was much more complex then that.Worth it's lofty status."
16 oz can poured into a snifter. 
"Murky gold (SRM 5) in a Cisco fisheye pint glass. The one-inch, creamy white to lemon sherbet head lasts a short while."
Don’t think it can possibly get any better than this
"According to my taste......... great beer. Not as heavy as the heady topper and leaves an amazing bitter aftertaste.Taste lingers for a LONG TIME. This beer is godly; warm, cold, day old open.... palate destroying beer."
"07/2014 - Piney, pineapple, kiwi, hop forward aromas; fruity, sweet, some caramel, sharp hop character; super tasty but not as good as it's older brother."
"Topper is better, but still an awesome IPA. Great Amber color and citrus aroma and good bitterness. Would definitely drink again."
clean crisp hoppy goodness. A touch of malt sweetness to balance the perfect bitter and nice clean dry finish. IPA heaven
Saw this reviewed in the BA magazine for the first time years back. Was lucky enough to get one from a friend at a wedding soon after. Seemingly smoother (as far as malt backbone) and fuller with hops compared to Heady. Floral yet smooth pine.
A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing
This is a what an America IPA should taste like. Hits you in the face in the best way possible. Bit of an old school malt bill. I would take this over any of the juice bombs flooding the market these days. They went big and came up with something spectacular that still hasn't gotten old. I have been drinking this for years and it is just as mind blowing as the first time I had it--can't say that about many beers. If I had to choose a beer to represent America this would be it.
"16 oz can graciously, awesomely traded from brutalfarce. That guy's a hero. No can date. I poured a third of the can into a tall K Constantinople 16 oz shaker pint (due to my experience of Heady Topper being better from the can). "
Drank it from the can with a small pour into a taster to assess appearance
Far more bitter than most NEIPAs. Works for me.
"Had a can at Prison City Brew Pub. Thought it held up well to the hype. Poured a big creamy head; somewhat meringue like on refill pour. Light yellow haze. Nose was citrusy but surprisingly biscuity as well. Bright and fresh aroma. Taste went same way. Love the Citra/Mosaic combo. A very tasty hop yeast combo that drove the citrus but not overtly juicy. Notable bitterness but a bit gentle for an IPA. The pale malt flavors really rounded out the taste with some biscuit. Feel was slightly full and soft creamy carbonation wise. Overall it was quite a beer coming out of the can, and actually had some characteristics of a hand drawn pale ale. My kind of session beer. I know I could sip on this for a long time. "
"From a can into a tulip glass, hazy, yellow in color, balanced between citrus and pine notes..."
"Friend sent it to me from the east coast so it may have skunked. Ultimately it’s the taste that carries the day and the taste was pretty dank, musty and a bit heavy. Nose was amazing , looked hazy and thick, but the taste was thick as well."
Cans from 8/3/18. Also tastes better and less muddled after a week or so in the can.
"Finally got to try this beer. In this case the hype is true, great IPA bursting with flavor."
"Cloudy, golden color. Lots of clumps from the leftover yeast. Small but lasting head. Some initial 3D spots on the glass. Infrequent spots thereafter."
"Not impressed. Too dank/ bitter. No citrus flavor or juiciness at all. Heard so much about Alchemist and was greatly let down/ dissapointed. If you like bitter IPAs, then it's for you. Some people love the dank/ bitter/ sour style. I didn't like this beer. It didn't taste like my style of IPA."
"16oz can: This one pours a hazy/murky golden color. A bit of a white head and some lacing. Very nice nose. Love those citra hops. Various citrus and tropical hop aromas. Maybe some faint pine. The taste is excellent. This one is fairly bitter. Citrus hop flavors, as well as some tropical and pine. All nicely balanced."
"A: Bright yellow, cloudy but not murky, lingering white head"
"Two fingers of just off-white foam, decent density and an even surface, retention a bit above average, lacing starts off with broad splotches, however, there’s not much stick to it. Full haze to the yellow hued liquid, light enough that it remains somewhat transparent, good amount of tiny bubbles but no beads. Grassy, peppery nose, the white grapefruit juicy but still adds to the direct, erect posture, softened around the edges by cocoa and malted milk ball notes, gets danker as it warms which blots out some of the ripe pineapple, mango, peach fruit scents, overall the herbaceousness is dominant. Medium-bodied, the carbonation active from the first sip and helps extend palate coverage to completion. Tangerine, pink grapefruit prominent, turning to more sour white grapefruit through the finish. Tar, resin, damp herbal matter anchor it, pine deepens towards the end. Leaves a bitter, tacky residue behind. More doughy than malty per se. The fruit flavors lack clarity, a mixture of peach, apricot, papaya and other tropical fruits, neither too sweet nor tart. Its thickness slowly wears you down, two cans in one sitting might be the limit."
Kind of malty for an ipa
"From the one pint can that was delivered to my store on 7/30/18. Sampled on August 2, 2018."
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a decent lace. Clear straw color but with a ton of floaties some ½"" wide. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light grapefruit nose and flavor is grapefruit with hints of caramel malt. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Looking for a replacement to Heady Topper - this isn't it. $3.99 for a 16oz can from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
"An amazing blend of fruity and hoppy. A lot of comparisons to Heady in the reviews so let me just say that these are pretty different beers. FB’s flavor profile has a bit more going on whereas Heady is just perfectly balanced. With that being said, Heady is my favorite beer from The Alchemist but FB is also a beer that can’t be missed."
A: Poured into a tulip to a light golden orange topped by a dense finger and a half of white head which retains well and leaves excellent lacing
"Poured from a 16 ounce into a jelly jar as it is labeled ""drink from the can!"". Nice golden color with decent head. Smells wonderfully sweet and tropical. First sip is just as good. It tastes like it smells which is unusual. Very hoppy without being overly sweet or bitter. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Nice resiny hoppy mouth retention that lingers long after the sip has been swallowed. It is a perfect example of a Vermont IPA. I suspect it may be around longer than some of the sweeter versions that are currently all the rage. A great beer. Glad I grabbed a case."
"Looks amazing, didn't take it out of the can! Smell is a tropical fruit sensation, citrus lemon lime and grapefruit, and a great fatty sweetness that I just wasn't prepared to smell. Like caramelized sugar and butter before it it burns. Taste is just overwhelmingly pleasant hops that coat every square inch of your mouth. Body is perfect for the drink, but I would like it to be a little heavier so I didn't want ten more! Very light and drinkable, absolutely fantastic IPA. If only every brewery looked to these people as an example of a beer that should be produced for the market, said market wouldn't be flooded with so many bland half ass beers."
"Picked up some at the brewery, tried on tap and from the can, the review is from the can. "
L - 2-finger bright white head atop a translucent orange body.
"Just poured about 4 oz into a taster glass to see the glory and drank the rest from the can, as requested by John Kimmich."
"DATE: June 8, 2018... OCCASION: pulling out the big guns, as the Cavs attempt to avoid a sweep... did not think it would come to this, but perhaps LeBron's greatest asset is his ability to make us believe... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours a grand half-headed body, mostly opaque, with a bright lemon-golden thickness... the snow-white head clumps into coral lacing that stretches into a creamy consistency... extremely intense tropical aroma, with grapefruit, mango, lemon zest, robust pine, and light spiciness... the citra lays on the heavy on the grapefruit and lime... quite alluring... the first sip is winning, with a bold, heavy draw that lightens through the mouth... its finish is creamy, fulfilling and strong--and at 7.5% ABV, a worthy nighttime companion... the flavor profile is citric, with pineapple and mango pounding the taste buds... a malt presence is detectable, but balance is not really the goal here--pine smashes the profile as well, making this a beer that follows Heady Topper faithfully.... a BIG shout-out to Jeff (again!) for making this one happen... wish I had a four-pack to burn through, but one is enough to make this night worthwhile..."
"This reminds me of what skiing was like before everyone started wearing helmets! Super hazy, full of flavour (meaning, you’re girlfriends probably not going to like it), and boozy! If you don’t like what the Alchemist is doing, I don’t want to know you!"
"Had this on 2018-06-02 in Philadelphia, PA at Monk's Cafe on tap. John Kimmich, brewmaster of The Alchemist was in attendance. "
16 oz can poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass
"Picked this up in Redlands, CA"
"Poured from 16oz can into (yes I know, drink from the can) Spiegelau IPA glass. No date. "
"L: hazy golden. 1/2 inch head of small bubbles. Thin lacing that lasts quite a while. Cloudy, but not too much so."
"Slightly cloudy in color. You can smell the hops and citrus immediately. The taste is outstanding with strong hops and the citrus. For feel, it is definitely dry-ish at the end. An overall incredible IPA."
"My favorite beer, a lovely well balanced, delicious IPA from the amazing Alchemist brewery!"
"16oz can undated purchased at the brewery. Gold color and hoppy/citrusy nose. Hoppy taste included citrus rind, apricot and pineapple. Very good balance of hops and malt. Very smooth, enjoyable and flavorful. Definitely one of the top beers we've had."
"Thanks to jhavs for this one. I broke the rules by pouring this 16oz can into a 12oz tulip. I once had Heady in a glass side-by-side with Heady in the can once, and, I didn't find any appreciable difference. Focal isn't as ugly as Heady, pouring a cloudy yellow with about 1/2 inch of white head that had low retention and lacing."
A bar setter. Juice bomb with a hop forward bite throughout the pint. I choose this over Topper 9/10.
This beer is going to make some people happy and some people unhappy. Poured from a 16 ounce can into a pint glass. As obviously an unfiltered beer as I have ever poured into a glass. More floaties than a Heady by a substantial margin. Still a nice golden orange with a half finger of head that sticks around for a while. Nose is citrus fruit and medium-strong dankness in approximately equal measure. It's an experience before you even take a shot.
A great beer. Worth finding.
Damn good beer
"Into 16oz Spiegelau IPA, after drinking some from the can (per the directions). Medium head, and lacing. Listless particulates were everywhere."
"This is what I wish ""hazy"" was -- clear, but with just a little something to show hops were definitely used to make it. I like the straw color, giving you an idea of exactly what was used to make it. Huge frothy white head that leaves a ton of lacing and takes forever to fall away. "
One of the best beers i have ever had. Better than heady. So good.
A-left this in the can as prescribed 
"Tied for worst beer I've ever had. Almost threw up. Had two tastes, then poured down drain. Way too much hops. Like eating a handful of salt."
"Pours a slightly hazy, deep gold, amber coloration with a medium, frothy head. Lots of floaters during final pour. Smell is quite hoppy and sweet, with notes of tropical and citrus fruit: Mango, papaya, peach and tangerine. Taste follows the nose, being quite hoppy with almost no malt presence at all. Notes of tropical and citrus fruit: mango, papaya, peach, tangerine; with quite some dankness, but little resin to it. Finishes with a medium bitterness. Nice, smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. I can see why people call this Heady Topper's little brother, the two are quite similar in my opinion. This has a slightly less rich and complex hop profile, being more tropical, even less malt and also less of a resinous quality, but more dankness and bitterness, which is why, I suppose, some people like it better. However, it also has a significantly worse mouthfeel in my opinion."
16 oz can poured into a shaped IPA glass.
"Lots of hops. No real distinctive flavor, other than bitter."
It pours a slightly hazy lemony yellow with a fairly decent head of good retention. The aroma is piney and floral. The taste is also piney and resinous and the bitterness very intense and insanely long lasting. Lovely thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and a sensation of coating one's tongue with bittering hops.
Fresh can from brewery last week poured into a tulip glass. 
"poured from a can. I believe it's fresh, but didn't see a date code. solid IPA. great bitterness without trying to smash you over the head with hops. nice body without being too thin. Aroma seemed more subtle than I expected, but was present - getting a lot of pineapple from it. Hazy yellow appearance. wish I could get this more often (not readily available in my area). Great IPA."
"a: slightly hazy burnt orange color with some darker amber notes towards the center of the glass. large, 2 finger rocky white head. great looking head on this one"
My favorite Alchemist.
"Always wanted to try this, stoked. Consumed during Super Bowl LII. This can was really old, but still retained it's flavors well. I tasted leafy citra hops, grassy notes, lemon notes. Perfect amount of bitterness balanced with the malts. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy, coating the mouth. Good bright hop flavors. Would love to try this fresh."
"Golden yellow in color with a hazy, unfiltered appearance and lots of floaties. Poured with a moderate, dense, creamy, bright white foam that reduced to a soapy cap. I can smell this from halfway across the room. Intense earthy, resinous citrus hop aromas with mellow floral notes. Prominent, medium malt aromas beneath. Medium bodied with soft, medium carbonation. Smooth, delicate, creamy smooth feel up front followed by light prickly warmth to the finish. Medium high earthy, resinous hop flavors up front that transition to sweet malt. Medium, pine hop bitterness through the middle returning to resinsous hop and malt flavors to the end. Finished with light, sweet, bready malt flavors followed by lingering, mellow, pine hop bitterness. Aromas were intense, but not sharp. Feel was fabulous, creamy and warming. The malt presence was surprising and providing a strong aromas and flavor backbone. Hop flavor was like getting shot out of a cannon followed by a pleasant gentle freefall. The flavors were intense out of the gate and slowly tapered to the end. Great balance, feel, aromas and flavors."
Pint can. Brewed with Citra and Mosiac and English malts. Unfiltered & Unpasteurized. Poured out into a classic Duvel tulipl 
"Honestly, after buying 6 types from the brewery and reading up on them, I knew this one was going to be my fav."
L: clear yellow with a finger of foam.
I have a soft spot in my heart for BIG New England IPA'S . This is a wonderful example of that. I was lucky enough to visit the brewery two years ago and purchase their Heddy Topper which sent me in search of more NE IPA'S. Love this beer.
CAN
"Had on tap at brewery. So I will start with the ratings that won't surprise people, the smell is a hop garden of paradise, with so much earthy, herbal, spicy, and bitter hops, along with plenty of citrus fruits, it is hypnotic. The feel is full bodied and relentlessly hopped, and this beer looks like a dipa beauty. Now for the controversy, the taste: there is no balance at all, just a wet hop bomb. A good hop bomb, but a hop bomb nonetheless. Alchemist is usually so good at balance, but here it tastes like pushing hop limits."
"Big thanks to judkinst! No canning date. Super chunky pour with lots of yeast. Huge, fluffy head and not nearly as hazy as I expected. Incredibly aromatic nose. All the good smells from a proper IPA. My goodness, how deliciously fruity this is. Insanely flavorful hop profile with a magically smooth feel and body, though quite dry, dank, and resinous. A definite hop bomb but balanced enough to make me wish I had several cans to follow this with. So. Damn. Drinkable. Wow!"
Amazing........
Close second to heady topper. Best on tap.
Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip... love the artwork (got the tee at the visitor's center to boot).
"While I understand that bitterness is not everyone's cup of tea, it seems that Focal Banger is the IPA's community's new darling specifically due to the softer, less bitter mouth feel (vs. The Alchemist's original golden child, Heady Topper). The beers do not seem to vary greatly in any other aspect."
"A little less citrusy than heady, but damn good"
"Can at Hellcat Annie’s, New York, NY"
Side by side with the Heady - I slightly prefer the Focal. Excellent offering from Alchemist.
"A delicious, juicy, hoppy delight. I started out drinking this from the can, then I poured about two thirds of my pint into my glass. Light golden, lots of chunks and kinda funky looking. Decent head and some lacing. "
Top 10 beers ever. Very citrusy. I prefer it to Heady any day of the week.
"Gotta say this is one of the finest ales I've ever tasted. Poured into a pint glass, the Alchemist floaties (chunks) might disturb some, but if this is what puts the beer over the top in flavor, I'm all in. A ridiculously flavorful IPA."
Look: Translucent straw gold that is slightly hazy. A moderate white head. Moderately active. Sticky lacing. 
Tried side by side a can of Heady
Better than Heady. Didn't think that was possible. It is dank and funky.
Look - transparent light golden color with very sticky lacing and a good white head
"Thank you, Devin."
"Pours a clear golden color with lots of floaties and a well retained one inch white head that left some lacing. Smells and tastes of sweet pink grapefruit, a little grapefruit pith, pineapple,cantaloupe, pine and a sweet malt backbone. Medium bodied, well carbonated, clean and crisp."
Look: clear golden straw with a nice white head.
Appearance: Pours hazy and amber colored with a one finger head; splashy lacing here and there
"Looks clear bright gold with with lots of fizzy carbonation, a huge soapy white head, with excellent retention and lacing."
"Can looked great! Finally moved this from ""want"" to ""got"". Truly one of America's Top 10 beers. The Alchemist Brewer and Mr. Kimmel are on top of their game with this one."
"16oz can, last survivor of Jhav's LIF box. No date that I can find."
javascript:void(0);
A side by side with Heady Topper. A good day to say the least.
Very few AIPA's can hang with Focal Banger. It's a bit more bitter up front than Heady Topper but still just as good.
"After seeing the hype around this beer & with my love for Heady, I had to wait until I had a few of these before rating. Are people right to say it's better than the legend? Just like all the Alchemist IPAs, the odour hits you as soon as you crack the can & you just want to let those hops roll over your tongue. It's a great beer; a nice very lightly cloudy straw colour with a fluffy white head with good retention & some light lacing. Grassy citrus dominates the hop flavour for me and there's a touch of dank in there along with that smoothness from the mosaic which then ends with a pleasant light pine dry bitterness. It's an excellent IPA but I still like Heady a little more."
My bad! I poured this into a glass. It is a slightly hazy gold color with lots of particulate matter. Fairly large white head and some nice lacing.
Excellent American IPA. Good blend of citra and mosaic hops. Good bitters that leave a nice aftertaste
"I prefer Focal Banger to Heady Topper. Retains the great haze, carb, lacing, tropical and dank aromatics with less of the alcohol kick. Huge aroma with a balance of sweet and bitterness. Easily crushable. Heady is great, but Focal is slightly better."
Great beer. Piney with a hint of hash. Full deep flavor. Mosaic hops shine through in this one.
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy yellow with nice white head. Good lacing. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon and a little pine. Extremely well balanced clean bitterness throughout. Mild sweetness to give it a malt backbone. Flavors of citrus fruits, pine, caramel. Excellent IPA. Definitely one of the best."
Huge thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this. One I've wanted to try for quite some time.
"From non dated 16 oz can. Hopefully fresh. Poured half into IPA glass the other half drank from can. Looks pretty average but had floaties. Smells great, piney, Citrus nose explosion. Taste is incredible, hoppy bitterness is at the perfect equilibrium with the malt sweetness. Begs me to drink more, and more, so drinkable. Glass empty. Now on to the can. There is something about drinking from a can that's so American and brings me back to my younger 1980's day of chugging Busch and Hamns, it actually feels better in the can. I'll drink the floaties and savor this most incredible IPA offering, fresh or not. Worth the hype. 4.60"
16oz undated can.
Amazing beer - way better then its sister Heady Topper.
"Wow, finally... I've been trying to get a hold of this beer for a loooooong time. Finally in my grasp after a family trip to Vermont, and God bless my family for waiting with me."
A: deep orange straw some bright orange in there in a little specs pretty darn easy super thick frothy bubbly whitehead 
Love this beer. Alchemist does not disappoint.
"Pours a half hazy light orange, with soft foam and a ton of floaties."
"500ml Can. Yellowish liquid with a decent white head with nice retention, some yeast particles inside the glass as well. Nose is hoppy as F*ck, citrus, pine, grapefruit, floral. Taste is medium bitterness, light sweetness, well balanced malt presence and hops, tasty! The mouthfeel is gorgeous as well, medium body."
"Pours a hazy light golden/yellow color with a soft streaking white head. Smell is tropical with some grapefruit and pine. Taste is dank and fruity with a fair amount of citrus bitters the mosaic and citra hops are nicely blended and create a juicy hop IPA. Mouth feel is soft and hoppy very little malt had a dry slight bitter finish. Loved this brew, like Heady a little better."
"Wow this was quite the gem. Big ups to Dino for hooking this up as part of our ""I'm too fat to fit into these screen printed jerseys from the 90s"" for your local bangers trade."
"Cans were purchased yesterday from the brewery. Poured into a teku hybrid glass, it's golden and cloudy with no hint of floaties whatsoever. Honestly, I so rarely see them in Alchemist beers and I figure my close proximity to the brew location and minimal transportation and temperature shift is the reason behind this. The beer itself is intensely bitter with pine and grapefruit flavors combining with a pleasing malt backbone. The hop bitterness lingers on the palate for quite some time."
Perfect to me.
Fresh can but seemed overall heavy.
Average rating from 12 members of the Eastman Craft Beer Club.
Drink from the can.
Sampled from can
"Man, really loved this beer. Loved the hip partials/floaties in the beer. The smell is phenomenal, can't wait to try Heady one day. I was supper happy to try this beer. The GOP character in this beer was phenomenal. I can't even imagine what Heady is like after this"
From can to snifter
"Pale couldy yellow. But out of the can there's tons of hop sentiment floating around. Smell and taste is very crisp piney hop. With some stone fruit. Perfect amount of bitterness and very easy to drink. I prefer a little more ""fruit"" hop flavor. But some amazing mouthfeel."
"A really smooth IPA. I like Heady a little more, but I will NEVER pass up a Focal Banger!"
"How does one segue seamlessly from The Eradication/Reduction of The Bottle Backlog at Chez Woody back into what really matters, namely, The CANQuest (tm)? Well, first, you have to jump into Mr. Peabody & Sherman's W.A.B.A.C. Machine, going back to the early-to-mid-1970's. There, a youthful Bro. Woody spent a LOT of time on his maternal grandparents' property, abutting a working farm. A young neighbor girl traded comic books & played tetherball with me. She grew up, married a fellow local beer aficionado & during a recent road trip to VT, they knew to bring me CANs! Viva The CANQuest (tm)! It pays to advertise. "
Probably my fav beer by then but the floaties are so off putting.
Wow!! what an ipa! This is probably one of the best beers I've ever had. I'm partial to IPA's and while on vacation in VT I stopped by the brewery and brought it back to GA to share with fellow beer connoisseurs. The flavor keeps you coming back for more. Outstanding!!
L: Pours a golden yellow with about a finger and a half of white head that fades quickly.
Look is a golden yellow that is opaque but surprisingly not very hazy. 2 fingers of bright white head that dissipates quickly. Also has either yeasties or pieces of hops in the bottom of the glass. 
"Poured into the alchemist IPA glass. A gold yellow pours in with a large, thick and bubbly head forming. Giant glaciers of head begin to melt and collapse apart in the glass. It Peels away leaving lace all along the glass. Little bubbles rise to the too as hop resins fall to the bottom simultaneously. Unfiltered and gorgeous. "
Poured from a pounder can with NO freshness date(!) into a Spiegelau IPA glass
Straw cloudy color with nice white head that dedicates quickly. Nice citrus aroma with a hint of hoppy. Taste is a very pleasant combination of citrus and hops.
"This was poured into a stemmed pilsener. Next time from the can for John Kimmich. The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange (grapefruit looking) color. A two finger white foamy head started off and dissipated within about a minute leaving messy foamy lacing clinging to the glass. The smell had a big sweet sticky burst of bitter grapefruit rind, extra lemon/orange rind helps to embed a nice edge. Light grassy tones arrange to balance. The taste was bittersweet sticky citrus weaving into the aftertaste and leaving a wet grapefruit bitter finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed good for the style and for me allowing the bitterness to take effect of the harshness on my tongue. Overall, hot damn, everything is in place to be the best AIPA on the market. This one may have eluded me for so long but now I want this all of the time."
It is SO close to Heady T and for my old sniffer and tastes buds there isn't a whole lot to diffrentiate between the two. They are BOTH amazing beers. I could only get FB at the brewery and I can find Heady outside the brewery and Heady has that in its favor. I've been hearing a lot about it and am glad I could finally try it.
"16 oz can served at Churchkey in DC. What did I do to deserve this beer available to me, I'll never know."
"in a can? in a glass? tastes better out of the can, smells better out of the glass. delicious IPA nonetheless, as you can't go wrong with citra and mosaic when done right... and this is done right."
"From Bierkraft. In Teku glass. After dinner. Really tasty and amazingly smooth, giving it plenty of personality. However, it could have more aroma and less sediments."
Thought it was good. But not sure about all the hype. I MUCH preferred HT to this.
"16 oz. Drank most from the can as instructed, but poured a bit into glass to see it."
"Look: Bright Orange with floaties all over- sitting in the foam head, swimming in the beer, and settled at the bottom. "
As instructed by the can..I drank the first half from the can!
"I feel like the last several Focal production runs I have gotten are not as good as they used to make. I am not sure if they changed something or I've just gotten a bad batch, but I used to think Focal was the best beer out of the Alchemist and it has not lived up to that lately."
Consumed 5/1/17
L: Light gold color with a decent white head that faded a bit.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass.
Wedding gift!
"Not quite at the same level as Heady, but of course I doubt it is supposed to be. Regardless, and very impressive entry that leaves most other IPAs in the dust. Glad I have tried it and I would definitely go for more!"
"Drank it from the can, but it tastes cloudy. I'm giving it a 4 for the can art. "
This is a very smooth beer I got in a 4 four pack with Heady Topper straight from the brewery. You definitely could taste some piney notes and orange/grapefruit hints. I wish I had more of this to drink.
"Look: Gold, moderately hazy with two inch head that sticks around for a little bit."
Pours out a very hazy bright yellow.
"Nothing I could say with my somewhat ""undeveloped"" palette that hasn't already been said. Amazing beer and the only small thing I could possibly say that hasn't been said 1000 times in these reviews is the feel. It has a thicker feel than most IPAs and with that I wound up slowly sipping it almost like it were a stout. Bravo"
"This beer has more ups and downs than a roller coaster, certainly an experience worthy of review."
"This is a quintessential beer. Out of the can or pour into a glass. Perfection. All flavors perfect pleasantly bitter, a touch sweet, strong hops not overbearing ... very little if any booze. Just the perfect beer. This is a must try. So good when it hits your lips haha. Thanks Alchemist"
We don't get this ridiculously solid NE style IPA down in Texas much. But thank you internet and quick shipping.
I drank from the can so I gave it a 5 in look!
Not as good as its Heady Topper counterpart but is most definitely a worthy ale.
Poured from can. Look is straight golden. Love the floaties. Smell is very citrusy. Hint of lemon on the nose. Taste is citrus which moves to dry and then fades from the palate. Very nice east meets west. Crisp crisp finish.
"I really wanted to see and smell this beer, so I ignored the rules and poured it into a tulip glass. "
"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/creamy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy mouthfeel that is insane. Perfectly balanced. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Super dank and fairly juicy on hops; just enough malt for bitter balance, with minimal residual sweetness. One of the smoothest IPAs I’ve ever drank. It gets quite resinous/drying through the glass; but still remains very crisp, drinkable, and never astringent. A really delicious and highly impressive offering all around."
"Broke the rules and poured it into a glass. A golden-orange hazy color with a modest white head that settled into a firm cap. Serious floaties that entertained me. Aromas included berries, grapefruit, mango, and a touch of bready malt. Not a blast of aroma (unsure on the canning date) but very nice. I had big expectations going into the first sip, and this did live up to the hype. Nicely balanced juicy citrus, berries, resin, and faint crackery malt. Love the juxtaposition of the citrus/dank in the one. Firmly bitter and clean on the finish with a slick feel."
"Looks wise, this beer might as well be Coors light. Obviously, I usually drink these out of the can, but I poured a little out to get a feel for its look. "
"Beautiful hazy orange-gold IPA, topped by a thick foamy snow-white head. Outstanding head retention, leaving behind blotchy patches of lacing."
"This beer is lifechangingly awesome, it's just so juicy, I get tons of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and lemon drop with a malty sweetness that keeps it very well balanced. Then you get a nice dry finish leaving you wanting your next sip. I'm going to be seeking this out regularly, I'm not a regular trade, but I will be now."
One of my favorite beers ever.
Www.beertodaybeertomorrow.com
A pint can with no visible date but it was part of a fresh box that fellow BA jhavs recently sent. I'm disregarding the 'drink from the can' and pouring it in a 13oz. tulip for the review. 
"Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow straw in color with maybe a quarter inch of white head. Aroma isn't as strong as I would have expected but it is complex; I get pine, citrus, stone fruit, and tropical fruits. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma; pine upfront, tangerine, grass, smooth mango, and some nectarine. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Quite a tasty beer, I preferred the Heady that I had last night but this isn't far behind."
"Pours pale, little hazy with off white head. "
"The first time I had this, I thought there was something wrong with the can. It was after a few Tree House Beers and this one came across as excessively bitter and harsh. I have since had it on a fresh palate and like it a lot. It is assertively hopped and more bitter than other Alchemist beers but still nicely balanced. It is a palate wrecker and you will have trouble properly judging any beers consumed immediately after. Personally, I like Heady better but that is what makes this all so much fun. Try one if you can."
Drinking from can as instructed
Better than Heady!
"Poured half the can into a glass and got a hazy gold colored brew with a ton of sediment floating around in it which looked like a snow globe and went up to a 2 finger thick foamy/cloudy bright white colored head that was packed with bubbles of all sizes, dissipating very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing that slides down the glass, some sticking around."
Tropical bomb on the nose. The palate is a long drawn out crisp floral bitterness which is balanced by mango and apricot sweetness.
Pours a hazed light golden color with tons of sediment. It's natural but there is so much here it's kinda gross.
Poured to a tulip glass.
"Although it's often overshadowed by its bigger brother, Focal Banger is worthy of your attention. Deep hop complexity is complemented by the Alchemist's signature malt balance. Minor points against because the loose sediment is a turnoff for some. I'm just glad it's not so murky I can't shine a flashlight through it. Then again, perhaps this is a moot point considering one is supposed to ""drink from the can!"""
Beautiful brew. Bitter and a tad harsh at the back end. More pine than citrus.
"Floral from the can, very little fruit, loads of mosaic in the mouth. Crisper mouth feel."
"A little heavy on the malt under pinning it, very bitter and hoppy. Quite excellent! Shipped by a very nice Vermonter to Oak, CA, Feb 2017"
Hot damn! Smells like heaven. Am I in heaven?
Nice haze look to it with a bit of sediment suspended. Great piney bitterness to this beer. Clean finish that is well balanced. Really enjoyed this beer.
"Fucking beautiful, its heady with more grapefruit less alcohol"
"Very nice taste to it. There is an instant aroma when you open the can. Smells a lot like Heady Topper and can arguably stand up to Heady as well. If you pour in a glass, you will see a lot of chunks float around. Doesn't leave that after taste either. Outstanding work of art."
Type: 16-oz. can
"Pours a light hue somewhere between yellow and orange with a layer of haze and fog to it. Head formation is two fingers, with an aggressive start, and a conservative finish. Foaming action of the head is easily controlled. Great head retention followed by great lacing left behind after each sip. Off to a strong start. Aroma is citrus, papaya, and mango. Malts are well hidden, keeping the aroma centered on citrusy hops with little divergence from the bulls-eye. Flavor profile is a smooth induction of light citrusy hops, with not much else to finish it. It's very one dimension in that the flavor profile is all delicate citrus hops, and yet it refrains from being bitter or unbalanced. There is a hint of biscuit malts in the back. Mouth feel opens thin, with a feel that gets a little fizzy and thicker as the beer warms on the palate. Overall, a slightly fizzy, but otherwise smooth IPA. It drinks much smaller then a 7% IPA, and yet has plenty of powerful flavor. Nicely constructed and executed. "
Nice haze look to it with a white head as well. Great pine like bitterness to this that hides the malt bill. Clean finish that is well balanced. Will try again.
"I’ve drunk quite a bit of Focal Banger before, so I’m coming to this review with a fair amount of bias, but I’m trying to approach it as though I’m drinking it for the first time. Also, as a writer who cares a lot about “authorial intent,” I’m extending that concept to “brewer’s intent” and drinking it out of the can. So there:)"
"Wow....I think I like this one better than Heady Topper. When you pop the can, it's just like opening up a pack of fresh hops. There is so much citrus and dank green hop aromas going on. Can't see what it looks like cuz I drank it straight from the can as instructed but the artwork is killer and top notch. Tastes great. So much ripe dank hop goodness. After this and a Heady Topper previous to this one, the alcohol is going straight to my head. "
"Awesome brew, got a can from about two weeks ago according to a trade partner...I like this one more than Heady in that it is a tad less bitter and more flavorful on the palette."
"Pours hazy gold with suspended sediment. Medium, thick, white head that didn't last long."
Better than heady
"For me better than Heady. More balanced, with a some malt notes occasionally coming through past all the hoppy goodness."
"Medium to dark golden with a white, airy head that leaves some beautiful lacing. Some floating sediments, but much more so the less fresh the beer is. Aromas of wet grass, pine, spicy green onions, with some fruitiness - almost grape-like? - playing more of a supporting role. Taste is bitter, but juicy. Like biting into a grapefruit, pith and all. Moderately carbed with a semi-dry finish. Overall, fanfuckingtastic. Per usual, drink fresh. (Had a case and after a few weeks the flavors fade noticeable, though the bitterness reamins.)"
A- Huge billowy bone-white head on a light dull orange body. Splotchy lacing. Cap and collar throughout. 
"Pungent, crisp, clean, balanced, vibrant. Fresh pineapple all freakin day. "
I call it Heady Toppers baby bro....You can tell they're related but Heady is stronger.
Excellent stuff. I get hop resin. Resiny hops. Really fresh. Smuggled out of Vermont. Heady who?
I might like this better than heady I can't decide
"I must be in the minority these days, but I prefer HT over FB. This somehow come out tasting stronger, to me, than HT."
great smooth IPA with a nice bitterness in the middle to finish it.
I'm pretty sure I received an old can in a trade. Not a bad beer but I think this should be better than it is tonight. My score of 4 won't hurt this beers overall score of 100!!! Hope to revisit sometime.
"My girlfriend's favorite, and it has grown on me, but she drinks then all before I can get one because it is always my second choice."
"Pours golden with a ton of sediment. Nice head with nice lacing. Aroma is tropical fruits and earthy tones. Taste follows the nose withpineapple, melon,mango, hops. It's nice but not great. Strong IPA. Not worth the hype at all."
"L- Light cloudy tangerine color, some particulates floating but not much "
"It's been a while since I enjoyed some of Alchemist's offerings, and this is my first Focal Banger."
"Golden pale colour, although I drank it directly from the can, as suggested."
Another incredible double IPA from The Alchemist. I wish this was as available in package stores as Heady has become over the years. 
"Poured a 16oz can into a snifter, sorry not consumed out of the can. Nice, light orange color and slightly hazy appearance with a white two finger head. Loads of pine, resin, yeast, and papaya aromas. Some lemon, orange and dankness breaks through as it warms in the glass. Flavors totally mirror the aroma with hoppy bitterness and subtle fruit sweetness. Nice, hoppy bitterness lingers for some time. Great IPA!"
Huge hop aroma and wonderful hoppy flavor without being overly bitter.
Drank first couple of sips from the can out of respect and finished in a glass. 
Look: There are a lot of floating materials in this beer that appear to be parts of a lemon.
Drank 07-08-16.
"Nose just barely hints at the peachy stone fruit melange that is to come, providing a seamless transition from aroma to flavor."
"still believe Heady is the best beer I've had from these guys. pours a semi hazy orange, floaties seen so not sure how old my can was (no date, tsk tsk). smell was big on the mosaic, but also had an orange scent to it, no malt on the nose. taste was bigger on the orange, but also at the same time very resinous and almost west coasty in the IPA realm of things. feel was alright, though I feel it could have been a tad better. overall this is another decent offering from Alchemist, but it's no Heady Topper to me."
Poured from a can into a Tired Hands tulip glass. 
"Poured very hazy deep straw colored with fluffy white head that had good retention. Scent was combo of citrus and tropical fruits - pineapple, lemon, grapefruit with a bit of pine. Flavor followed scent and had an impressive lingering effect on the palate. One of my favorite IPAs ever, I'd take this over Heady Topper."
"The beer pours hazy, yellow with a huge, four finger high, fluffy white head that leaves lacing clinging to the glass. (Spigelau IPA glass)"
"I have to agree with many of the reviewers that this beer is better than heady. For me, it's way better! Focal Banger has more balance with the fruitiness (I taste a lot of peach) working well with a sustained bitterness. I find it pretty smooth/drinkable. Really enjoyed this one!"
Poured into a teku pint. No freshness date.
"I was excited to try this one, and I found it to be a wonderful beer. I drank this from both the can and a glass. Haziness is there, but nothing like some of the beers coming from TH. Smells of pine and pot. Taste is a bit light for my taste... nothing stood out distinctly. The bitterness lingered, although not overwhelming. Medium-light body with perfect carbonation. I prefer its bigger brother, but this was an absolutely wonderful treat."
"First of all, I like this a lot more than Heady...yeah I'm that guy."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Drank from the can countless times, but I had to pour it for appearance and aroma! Purchased at the brewery. "
16oz Can
"First had at The Alchemist Brewery and Visitor’s Center, Stowe, Vermont, on draft sample into footless goblet, and again poured from pint can, purchased at The Alchemist, Stowe, into TEKU. Sharper initial bite than Heady, but possibly more hop flavors. And dangerously drinkable."
Alchemist knows their stuff.
"A very nice IPA, better than Heady Topper for sure, there's a lot more going on in here than Heady and its definitely a little fruitier, however this is still overrated and simply usnt up to the standard of ipa being set by the likes of treehouse, grimm, finback etc. How this is #8 in the world is baffling. Very good but seek out the breweries i mentioned and you'll find better alternatives."
"Golden/straw but a ton of yeast particulates. Pretty clear. I can't place the smell really. It isn't ""bright"" or ""dank"" or really any other thing I can put my finger on, but it is strong. Taste is spicy and grassy, a little stonefruit. Moderate carbonation, lovely feel."
16 oz. can
First had 8/12/16 at Musikfest courtesy of my friend Eric L. Slightly juicier and more refreshing than the infamous Heady topper. I prefer this or Crusher over Heady any day.
Was lucky to score a single can a couple weeks back. Following directions and drinking from can so no comments on appearance. Nice mouthfeel. Taste is great! Not malty just a super hopped IPA that lives up to its reputation.
"Poured a golden wheat color with ample amounts of white head. The smell has a ton of pine in it mixed with citrus fruits and a good bit of malt. The flavor is very balanced. The combination of piney dankness, fruity sweetness, and malty bread works perfectly in this beer. The hype around this one is well deserved."
had in can at Owl Farm NYC around a day after they got a delivery of it.
"Appearance: light gold, white head"
The Alchemist Focal Banger
"This beer is much better than heady topper in my opinion. If you have to pick between the two, I would opt for this one. Can't review the look because it's supposed to be drunk from a can but the smell is very intense and pungent hop notes with citrusy characteristics. This beer strikes the perfect balance between flavor and carbonation. Shyttt is bomb"
This is a fantastic NE IPA. A delightful hop bomb with a crisp mouth feel. I could probably drink these all day on a hot summer day and not get tired of it.
"Excellent beer, glad I was able to finally try some this and Heady. I think this is better than Heady, the Citra/Mosaic combo is hard to beat for me."
"I prefer Heady but this was good, the floral back end is not my style. Glad to try it, masterful brew!"
"Had this back to back with Heady and this one is better. Pours a very hazy orangey golden color with a bunch of thing suspended in the beer. Smell is generalized citrus with grapefruit predominating. Whereas Heady had the more complex smell, this one has the more complex taste. Taste follows right along with smell. Citrus yet it has a dry finish and is not at all sweet. Very balanced and not overly bitter on the back end. Feel is medium. Overall this is a great beer, mostly due to the hop profile. Classic NE IPA."
This beer stays true to The Alchemists level of brewing. It is a world class beer with the flavors and mouthfeel you come to expect from them. Never would turn this down and always want more!
"Appearance: pours a hazy golden yellow color with a 2"" head that lasts a while. Mild lace paints the glass."
"I was honestly let down by this beer. Crusher is one of my all time favorites and obviously Heady is one of the best out there, but focal banger was a huge let down. Too boozy without much flavors to offset it. It's not so bad that I would turn it down, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"I have had heady on a few different occasions and was pleasantly surprised at how much different focal was. Upon opening the can the aroma jumps out at you and after tasting, the flavor to me, is the best part! Very well executed east coast style."
Many thanks to millerbuffoon for this can of hoppiness.
"most excellent probably like this much more than Heady, poured a little in to a glass to view, mostly yellow and light. the deep smell and taste of an alchemist beer, deep flavor citrus and a very balanced offering, wish access was consistent would have this often. less carbonated then heady and this is a good thing. great great beer."
Can poured into a Sam Adams glass
Alchemist says drink it from the can and I can see why! My fiance and I split the can so I poured it out into two glasses and we got a huge lump of sediment plop out of the can. BE AWARE WHEN POURING THIS BEER!
"Very enticing, delicate tropical fruit and juicy citrus aromas with scant sugar cookie balance. Unfortunately that tropical fruit was largely missing behind some surprisingly strong citrus rind bitterness. This is a damn good ipa, just not on par with the other two ipa's I've had from the Alchemist."
"Nosed from the can, it's straight pine and marijuana. Poured into two separate teku glasses (yes, yes, I know, flaunting the instructions on the can), we see a hazy orange beer, with a one-finger white head. Nosed from the teku, it's dank as dank can be. This beer smells like pure marijuana, in a way that is unlike any DIPA I've ever tried before. The palate......wait. Wut? This beer tastes like week. I think they replaced humulus lupulus with cannabis for this canning. Pine and weed blend in an incredibly savory beer, accented by a faint undercurrent of honey-sweetness from marginal malt addition. Mouthfeel is solid medium."
"Got a ton of onion on this unfortunately, Will definitely try it again soon. Think it may be a personal issue as I have been getting a lot of onion off beers recently."
Poured a sample from the can and drank the rest straight.
"look is like a juice bomb, hazy orange."
"No can date, but it's a few weeks old if my info is correct."
Can Date: purchased 10/14/16
"In a time not so long ago there was a beer called Focal Banger It seems at first, It was only available in local bars and restaurants. Well, being a local, I got used to this. Then, as quickly as it came, it vanished from the greater Burlington area. Rumor on the street was that it would be available exclusively at the retail location in Waterbury. After several months of listless pining, I felt I had finally grown to accept this new reality. Nevertheless, I found myself occasionally compelled to request it at places where Heady Topper appeared on the menu. I knew the anwser, but asked it anyway- perhaps as a sort of symbolic gesture or solemn ode, to the beer that once existed so prominitely in the geography of my daily life. Then suddenly it happened. An anwser I did not expect. From the most unlikely of casual chain dining reauraunts inbetween a movie theatre and Best Buy. Yes. We do have Focal Banger, she replied. In disbelief, I had to ask the waitress to repeat this. And she did. And it was true. And she wisked off. Then there it was- that mythical black and silver can, all shining and gosaamer. And I drank it. And it was good. And it reminded me if the old times, when everything was right with the world."
L: What you want a juicy IPA to be. Yellow haze with huge white head. lasts for a while.
A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy golden-yellow with no real head.
"This beer is a masterpiece. More aromatic and citrusy than Heady Topper but still has a full body and uniquely awesome yeast profile. Peachy, mango, pineapple, juicy, hop flavor and aroma for days. This beer is a must have for any IPA enthusiast. Possibly not as full on the mouth as Heady or Crusher."
Poured from a pint can to glass:
"Not a pretty beer, but we all know the alchemist likes to make them chunky. The aroma is nice, I mostly get mosaic, but not extraordinary. The flavor profile stands out quite a bit more with a similar level of hoppyness, but very restrained bitterness and a round, not quite sweet, but not dry finish. Very nice, drinkable, juicy... I think I like this more than heady."
"Citra and Mosaic IPA at 7% abv - almost like cheating - medium gold and hazed, drank the bulk from a pint, finished the remains from the can - big aromas of citrusy pine followed by a wallop of bitter hop action crashing across the tongue. Suggestions of earthy, musky citrus fruit and with herbal pine around the edges, keeping it tight with tongue-clenching bitterness. Medium-light body, ample carbonation, and a clean, crisp feel. Finishes with a craving for me, but here in NY, I'm lucky I even got to try one. I like it more than Heady..."
Pouring a cellar temp pounder can into a snifter. Guess Im going against the order to drink straight from the can.
A perfect beer. Better than Heady in my opinion. Enjoyed poured from a can into a tulip glass at As Is in NYC. A friend brought it with him and shared. This beer blew me away.
Acquired in a trade. Said canned date 10/8. Holds up better than Heady and aromas of the hops were a shell of their former self. Bite on the back of the tongue was still there was some fruit flavors from the citra. From assuming this beer was a lot older than said canned date of 10/8 I can imagine it would be excellent younger than a month from the canned date.
Props to GreatStoutman for sharing this!!
Poured a little into a glass but drank most from the 16 oz. can. Bought it directly from the brewery. 
"Undated can into pint glass. Pours a hazy amber with a thick off-white head. Initial impression is citrus (grapefruit, pineapple, orange, mango) with a notable pine resin bite. A lcohol is quite well hidden - very drinkable. Mouthfeel and carbonation are perfect. Finish is somewhat bitter but not unpleasantly so. I'd still prefer Heady if given a choice, but Banger is pretty good too."
Poured from 16 oz can into snifter.
"Shared this so, despitee instructions, had it from a glass. Can bought at the brewery less than 2 weeks before. "
"A friend of mine sent me the Focal Banger and a Heady Topper. Both are truly delicious. I drank from the can like it says you should do but I also tasted it from a glass. I think it taste the same from the can and from the glass, but you get more aroma from the glass. Anyway,"
16oz can into a pint glass. Thanks again to Jonathan Hand. No freshness dating.
"Amazing beer. Better than Heady in my opinion. I really like mosaic hops though. Nice dank, dryish taste. Thinner feel. Overall, one of the best beers in the NE."
I prefer more than heady. A nice ipa when you want a non juicy ipa option.
Poured just a tad bit into a 4oz snifter to see it's color. Drank the rest from the can. 
Appearance 4.5
Perfect!
"Well, I really enjoyed Heady but I like this better. It's a smoother flavor and aroma package. Overall, it just feels like something they developed further and refined what already made Heady so tasty."
Better than Heady.
"From a 16oz can, undated but known to have been canned within the past week or so. Served in an imperial pint/nonic."
Finally got my hands on this whale. Definitely lived up to expectations in my opinion. Can't beat the OG. Fantastically drinkable and the mosaic and citra hops blend amazing together.
"Sweet and fruity, pine, orange, blueberry bubble gum, cinnamon or holiday season home décor spray."
"Pour is a semi hazy, medium orange hue. Big frothy head that sticks around for a while, lacing galore. Smell has that same, herby legitimate fresh hop smell that heady has. Mosiac hops shine through over everything, with hints of mango and other various tropical fruit. But the pungency of the hop character stands out over everything. Taste is that same herby, resinous hop character I get in the aroma. Solid amount of citrus rind and a tart buscuit malt character in the back end. Mouthfeel is relatively palate coating, but not quite as thick or oily, or even juicy as heady. Overall, this is a solid IPA. Not as complex as heady, or as tropical or juicy in my opinIon. More sessionable."
"Gotta say on the front end that the can I enjoyed had some age on it, at least a couple months. Poured into a tulip but also sampled some directly from the can to compare (from the glass was better). Light orange body with a thick, bubbly, white head that actually kept building after the pour as bubbles flooded up the sides of the glass. Beautiful, big-bubble lacing throughout the consumption process. Not nearly as hazy as I expected, but certainly not clear. And that's the first of multiple notes of ""fantastic but not as unique as I thought it would be."" Smell is extremely pungent, dank, herbal, piney, citrusy, tropical, and grassy. Some almost herbal notes of green tea, tobacco, and hemp mixed in, as well. As it warms the dankness drops off just a bit and the bright citrus comes more to the forefront. Taste is fantastic but, again, not as differentiated from many other big hop bombs that I've had before, and I was absolutely expecting this beer to be in a class of its own. Juicy, but not nearly as much as Heady, at least to my palette. Bitter, resinous pine, tart citrus rind, sweet tropical fruit, dank, biscuity cracker. The bitterness coats your teeth and tongue, with an almost sour quality floating in the background. Truly delicious, but not overly distinguished from a number of other citra- and/or mosaic-heavy beers I've had over the past year. Feel is chewy, sticky, thick, and smooth. You want to somehow simultaneously sip and chug it, the feel is so wonderful. Poured the last few ounces out with authority so as to enjoy the sea monkeys they produced, and that didn't do any harm to the drinking experience, at all."
"pours fairly hazy blond body. there are actually bits of chunks floating around in this thing. piney and citrus notes jump out in the aroma. the definition of juicy. great bright citrus and rind flavor follows. resinous and fulfilling. light bodied and easy drinking, can hardly tell the abv here. a very good ipa."
2 wk can poured into snifter. 
"Pours up with ample effervescence which creates a consistent white head that crowns the hazy, golden-ochre body leaving evident lace as it settles. The aromatics are layered with fruitiness (citrus .e.g. grapefruit, pomelo +pineapple), earthiness (berry, evergreen, pine cone) from the hops & a light-moderate graininess. Flavor starts off lightly bready with a pale maltiness that's quickly cut by an increasing amount of bitterness that somehow manages to stay balanced without becoming harsh. Superbly balanced IPA with an excellent creaminess that carries all those hops. Focal Banger is mind numbing. Cheers!"
"Poured 16oz can into snifter. Hazy orange appearance with a 2 finger white head, great retention and thick lacing on my glass. Aroma is bright with juicy tropical notes. Flavor is very tropical and dank, pineapple, mango, and papaya with hints of berry. Finish is on the bitter side. Feel is medium, well carbonated, and finishes dry. Another outstanding beer from The Alchemist."
"16 oz can picked up from the brewery, that stayed in the can. I am going to assume this looks good. Aroma of mango, fresh hops and grass. "
"Pours pale gold and quite hazy, a bit of an orange hue to it. Large white bubbles on the 2 finger head. Pretty good retention and nice lacing."
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
Just exceptional - hands down a top beer of all I've had.
Thank you jhavs for this
Really nice citrus forward IPA. I thought the aroma was about as pleasant as it could get but the taste was a little one dimensional and felt it needed a little more malt balance and also was a touch bitter in finish. Still a fantastic IPA none the less.
poured into glass w tons of floaties. tons. doors not look great. nose is good and taste follows with citrus and berry flavors muted in the back palate by some light spruce. body is great. overall the yeast strains seem to be similar for all the alchamist beers giving that pine yet soft nutmeg nuance. this beer to me is less harsh than crusher and may be better than topper. not crowning it yet but world class and if not for the floaties would be a higher rating.
"From the can, poured into a glass (yeah, yeah), it's quite hazy but not opaque. Glowing orange color looks nice. About a finger of dense white foam leaves little lacing. Smell and taste are hugely fruity and piney. Orange, pineapple and mango blend with fresh resinous hops. Pretty big and delicious bitterness on the back end is offset with a touch of sweetness. Slight bready malt makes an appearance, but only just. Insanely good, one of my all-time favorites."
"Really really really dank. I prefer heady topper but it was nice to finally try this guy. Nice hazy look much like heady, hops punishing my palate and that's ok with me."
"Better then Heady topper imo, I got a lot more hops out of this one. Looking forward to trying more beers from them if they taste anything like this one."
L - Hazy yellow with three fingers of white head
Poured into snifter. Big particulates floating with moderate lacing. Big danky smell. Hoppy and malty balance with a moderate bitterness. A great beer.
"Poured from can; Yes, I know it says ""drink from can"" but it's hard to rate appearance when it's in the can. Hazy, orange color with nice carbonation and one finger head. Lots of hops, medium yet balanced. Hops linger on the palate. It's not a Heady Topper, but it's a really good beer."
Topper gets all the hype but this was the best beer I have tasted . nice mango citrus notes with crisp bitter hop notes to finish.
"Look: Orange and very hazy. Big fluffy head, which lasts for a while and lots of lacing, snow globe."
"appearance- Golden amber in color, turbid yet a little clearer towards the bottom of the glass, and pours a two inch head."
Can courtesy of Schlimenhaumer. Regrettably brief notes below:
"Hops full on. Nothing restrained here. Very well balanced bitterness and much better mouthfeel then Heady. There, I said it. Very good beer showcasing the hops without overplaying the ""fruity"" card."
"2 week old can. Drank half from a snifter, half from from the can."
1 PINT can
Can (couldn't see a date):
Actual pulp in the bottom of my glass? can't get juicer than that
Love this beer Color Smell & Taste is hard to beat I will drink it every time I come across it.
"Consumed from the can as recommended, so don't know much about the color, head etc. -- will go 4.5 in appearance for cool can art and to match the rest of my rating. Initial burst of pineapple, tropical, hoppy nose. Initial taste is very Citra forward - grapefruit followed by more earthy bitterness on the back end. No big surprise that there is a ton of hops, but as with Heady, there is a balance and drinkability that is harder to find in IBU-heavy brews. If I am just buying into the hype, then I need to buy me some more. Bottom Line - world class."
"The beer pours a a slightly hazy golden amber color with excellent head retention and considerable lacing. The nose is attractive as well, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, onion, grassy hops, light tropical fruit, pepper and a dash of clove. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with a huge dose of hoppy bitterness on the finish. The citra hops in this ipa are very prominent. There's a hint of heat from the alcohol on the finish, but otherwise, there's not much to complain about in this hop bomb of an ipa. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied in this no holds bared ipa, and the finish is hugely bitter. I guess this could be a bit better balanced, but that's obviously not what the brewer is going for here. "
"Pale and light in appearance. Grapefruit, hop resin, herbal nose. Sweet. Taste is sweet citrus with tropical notes like pineapple and Mellon on the front of the tongue. Bitter hops build in the mid palate and finish along with lemon lime and green herbal notes which come on a little too strong for my liking. Mouth feel is creamy, full, and tight. There's so many great IPAs available today that it's hard to compare. This doesn't strike me as one of the best, but honestly it might just depend on the day when I'm grading IPAs. This is definitely a good one and worth seeking out."
"Pours cloudy straw gold with a big off-white head that remains as a thin cap on top and leaves strands of lace. There is visible floating hop resin. The smell is of subdued pine, faint tropical fruit, grass and, dare I say, sweat. The taste follows with grass, subtle pine, tropical fruit and, mild malt sweetness. Medium texture."
"Amazing IPA, easy drinking with low bitterness. Smooth blend of citra and mosaic."
Fresh can drank on 8/16/2016
"Look : Cloudy, chunks floating inside. Orange."
"Drank majority from can, poured a bit for look rating"
"Hops comes on strong and drops off fast. Then subsequent swallows even out. Initially bright hop flavor then some dank comes in. Light body, low carbonation, smooth."
Way better than Heady IMO.
Serving: Can
This lived up to the hype amazingly. Great pale color with Citra and Mosaic aromas that exploded out of the glass. The flavors completely backed up those aromas on the palate as well. Absolutely delicious beer
Says drink from the can but I poured a third to get a look at it. 
A - I know they say drink from the can. But I really like to see my beer. Pours a golden orange with an inch of foamy white head that never completely goes away.
"This might be the best beer I've ever tasted. It's not a beer I could have more than one of at a time, though. I was lucky enough to acquire a 4 pack from a friend who made the trip to Vermont. Had one fresh the day he returned. This beer is very complex. Now having had all 4 over the last week I can say that it's different things to me at different times. "
Smell: loads of mandarin oranges tangerine sweet fruit pineapple peach some dankness floral hops. 
"Bright orange-yellow, hazy with some microscopic floaters and a very large, foamy eggshell head. I see they are still not proud of the visual appearance of their beers considering the can art declaration that drinking from the can is still best. I'm a believer that aroma really makes a beer what it is, and if you can't smell the beer through the tiny hole in the car while drinking it, then you're not getting the full experience, period. Plus, it must be said, since nearly every brewery out there trying to keep pace with this style of IPA is doing the same thing, it's time to embrace the haze. After a few of these, I can definitively say they definitely have quite a bit of sediment in these cans--I've had one with an absolutely enormous colony of yeast clumped together and swirling around at one point. Definitely unseemly. You don't get this from Trillium or Tree House, ever. And Maine or Hill Farmstead, well they're on another level in regards to appearance."
ALCHEMIST FOCAL BANGER IPA 8/11/16
Thank you mymrnngjckt for the surprise hookup on this. Pounder can poured into a pint glass appears a light golden yellow color with a soapy white cap that fades leaving spotty lace.
One of my new favorite beers! Definitely on par with Heady.
"Drank this beauty straight from the can as recommended. Has a very hoppy aroma with some citrusy grapefruit and tropical fruit mango. Also some piney bitterness that compliments the other aromas very well. The taste is heavenly and follows the aroma in complexity--very hoppy, with the fruitiness in the aroma and some malt to boot. Well carbonated and very crisp! Excellent!"
"Huge thanks to cosmicevan for blessing me with a care package of NE IPAs. Focal Banger was def on my must try list, and it delivered. Great looking beer. Straw colored, and much less hazy then the stereotypical NE IPAs as of late. Mouthfeel was spot on, providing just the right balance of malt and hops. Not too heavy or light. That is not to say the beer isn't a hop lovers dream, it is. Great hop flavor and aroma. Def grapefruit forward in my mind. Overall a fantastic beer, and glad I got to try it."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a can glass. Yes, I know it says drink from the can."
"Poured a little into a glass. Yellow, Thin head. Had the rest from the can, as ordered. Smells of pine, grapefruit. Taste lives up to the smell and lingers. Feels pleasantly rough. Great beer!"
"Pours pale yellow with a fluffy white head. The aroma is a complex assault of pine, grapefruit, nut, and relentless dankness. IMHO, it's the star of this beer. It is bitter up front with more grapefruit and some malt sweetness and then finishes clean. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, it's delicious. How does it compare to its Heady brother? I'm not sure... Anybody willing to contribute multiple cans of each for testing is free to message me and we can arrange a trade. :)"
Focal Banger pours a hazy/opaque gold with a nice thumb and a half of head that lasts and lasts. There is fantastic lacing as the head breaks and as one drinks. A great looking beer.
"Wife and I had this while staying at a B&B in Burlington. We had a Heady and a Focal at the same time. We both loved them both, but gave the (very) slight edge to Focal Banger."
"16oz can. Pours a super hazy bright pale orange with an inch plus of frothy white head. Lots of lacing. Ripe tropical fruit aroma. Grapefruit, pineapple, tangerines, and papaya. The taste is lots of grapefruit followed up by the papaya and tangerine. Some pine and floral notes as well. Grapefruit finish. Very drinkable with a moderate alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation with an oily mouthfeel. I had this years ago back when the brewpub still existed and was pumped to see it make its return. Overall, outstanding IPA."
Wow.
This beer pours a hazy golden color with a gigantic fluffy white head. Retention is unbelievable and there are foamy webs of lacing all over the glass. 
"I've read and even heard from my friends and other craft beer lovers that this IPA is a ""Heady Killer"". I actually disagree with that statement. This is a very well brewed and delicious IPA and compared to other IPA's, YES! I consider this IPA a top tier, BUT Heady is a DIPA and in my opinion, going against Heady Topper, Heady will always win for me."
Rating incomplete
"Reminds me less of Heady's younger brother and more of Todd the Axe Man's younger, perhaps smoother brother. Delicious, two fingers of foam with a vigorous pour and beautiful color. Prefer Crusher to this but it's an unfair comparison as they are different animals (and splitting hairs, it's world-class). Perhaps the most balanced of the Alchemist triumvirate. Great, great beer."
"16oz can thanks to Jeremy. Followed The Crusher with this, which is also but stands just in the shadow of the Crusher. Pale golden with small airy head., A melange of malts and hops with some floral notes, carries over to the taste, a bit lighter than the former, and more savory to boot. The Alchemist has it going on!"
"Great IPA , amazing flavor, alot like his big brother, but different"
Review #4000.
Decided to pour into a glass contrary to recommendations. Nice hazy pale orange appearance. Thick consistent head. Luscious citrus aroma. Flavours bursting with citrus and pineapple. Not overly bitter taste. Medium body. 
"Every bit as good as Heady, a bit sweeter and more floral tones. Great mouth feel and head retention."
Heady Toppers little brother. Best described as the star quarterbacks younger brother that live on the coat tails while still having their own story. This is more fruit forward but that's very nice to make it different. Will absolutely grab whenever I possible can.
Split this with a good friend. i really like how The Alchemist encourages the consumer to drink out of the can for some very good reasons that are explained on the can.
"Smell is passionfruit, guava, pineapple, citrus, a hint of lychee, and a hint of pine. This is maybe the most tropical fruit-forward IPAs I've ever smelled. Taste is pineapple citrus, passionfruit, a little bit of malt sweetness, and a mild hop bitterness that contrasts well with the tropical fruit flavors. Overall just a killer beer, and maybe better than Heady Topper."
"As someone said in line while waiting at The Alchemist, ""Heady may be the beer that built this house, but Focal is king."" I'm so happy this is becoming more readily available, and I think others will agree soon enough that this one rivals, if not bests Heady Topper."
"Tasty IPA from the Alchemist. Slighty yellow color, bright aroma, medium mouthfeel. The can I had may have been a little older because it had a decent amount of particulate floating in the beer. Overall very nice and a worthy younger sibling to heady."
From can and glass. Under a week old.
"This is considered one of the best ipas in America. I was very happy to get a can from a friend and it is just that, one of the best ipas. Very citrusy, great mouthfeel, smells amazing. Overall, a great well-balanced beer with very fresh hop flavor"
Grabbed from the new brewery this weekend. Poured into a teku. 
"Is it possible that the Alchemist can brew a beer better than Heady Topper? Yes! At least, in my opinion although I'm probably in the minority. The Alchemist doesn't offer much for variety so they can focus on a couple of beers and really perfect them. And perfect them they have."
Great beer to its older brother
"There is a reason this is considered one of the best beers in the world. I am not a major hop head, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It is very bitter and has tons of hops, but somehow it is very well balanced and juicy."
16 oz can was poured into a chalice.
"16oz can, half poured into a blank tumbler glass, half kept in the can to compare as the can directly states ""DRINK FROM THE CAN"". Fresh can from the re-opening of The Alchemist's public retail space. "
Prefer this over Heady...
Fresh can about a week old. UPDATE: Second review on 8/9/16 from a fresh can consumed on day of pickup from new Alchemist brewery.
Could possible be the best beer ever :)
Another phenomenal beer from The Alchemist.
God bless the Alchemist. This is one hoppy monster and oh so delicious.
Freshly canned from the grand opening of The Alchemist's new location!
"Glad they're making this in droves now and is easily acquired without trading an arm and a leg because it's really not worth the accolades. Inferior to just about anything being produced by treehouse, trillium, or hill."
Ummm ya!!!
DRINK FROM THE CAN!
Revisit today July 20th 2018. I’ll leave the five because like all alchemist brews I’ve had they are in complete balance! You get what your looking for in waves and the next sip is just a little different making you mouth waiting for the next sip! Cheers.
Milder version of heady topper..good mellow beer. Enjoyed it
"This is one where the sum is greater than the parts. Had it straight out of the can in a restaurant in Burlington, Vermont. To me, the grapefruit and pine smell and flavor really ran over everything else."
"Had this while I was in a restaurant in Vermont. Tasted really good, but I still like Heady Topper a bit more. Had a great smell and taste. Glad I got to try this one."
"Not hazy, chunky. Smell was more muted than I expected. Great tropical fruit flavors."
"I'm not sure if this is a better beer than Heady, but it's definitely more up my alley in terms of what I'm looking for in an IPA. Lighter on the malt, heavier on the tropical fruits, and a beautiful dry finish. This is a top tier IPA, and manages to maintain high bitterness levels, while incorporating some of the softer flavors associated with these NE IPA's. Man, I can't wait until this is available by the case."
I have never experience such an amazing tasting beer! Love it!
"Just wow. The absolute only thing that could be classified as a complaint is the tiny amount of floaties on the bottom of the can (which I personally see no problem with). It's the same tingly hoppy floral and citrus perfection as heady exception in a slightly lighter and less dry IPA form. Perfect malt backbone to catapult the hop character. A little bit less complex than Heady, but don't let that take anything away from this gem."
The smell is amazing. Smells like a wedding in the meadow. The color is a hazy gold. It is the after taste of floral notes that makes this beer top notch. Not as much bite as Heady.
FINALLY got one at the Prohibition Pig on April 9. Poured a little into glass to see what it looks like; otherwise drank from can.
"Had this one straight from the can at Prohibition Pig in VT. This is a slightly better version of Heady Topper, the hops are juicier and the nose is stronger. Pro Pig almost always has it, so if you are in VT and want to tick this one, head to Pro Pig!"
great beer. love the citrus melong mix both on the nose and it the taste. This is one I really happy I could get my hands on.
"wow! been waiting to try this one.... drinking from the can like it commands, it tastes like Squirt. very delicious, very refreshing and very easy to drink! how does one rate it if one cant pour it into a glass, though? so i did. it actually may even taste a little different(?). slightly hazy, thin head. but yes, it DOES taste better from the can."
"good, but doesnt stand up to its big brother HT.. i dont know how old this can was so that might play a part in it as well.."
"A detuned Heady? Great IPA, citrus aromas and flavors. Can't wait till it's available on a regular rotation."
Hard to rate how it looks as I drank right from the can as directed.
"Lighter than the Heady Topper, but you get the same flavor profile. This one is smooth and piney, and I was able to drink these all night without getting really messed up like from the HT. Highly recommended."
"Review for b1 ""sticker can"""
"L: If you like your beers clear, you may want to keep this one in the can. Opaque with minimal head, and lots of floating hop goodness. Minimal alcohol legs but this is to be expected with a %7 brew."
Probably the most perfect IPA I've ever tasted.
White head. Lace. Hazed golden yellow.
"The dankest of the dank, hits the pallet soft and juicy, then it thrashes it with hops. Can almost feel your enamel being stripped. Truly a hop lovers dream."
16 oz can into tulip. No can date. 
"Can't wait to be able to purchase this beer, only had it at a restaurant a few times and love it."
"Had Focal out of a can at the Mule Bar in Winooski. Did not pour any into a glass, so I'm assuming the look is as awesome as the rest of it. The aroma is an explosion of citrus smells, as good as any IPA out there. The taste that follows is well balanced between hops and citrus, with a great, smooth feel. Really enjoyed this beer. It exceeded my expectations, and I'd take this over Heady. I hope they distribute beyond bars. It's a keeper."
"This is my favorite beer. A more balanced heady with less alcohol hotness and more juicy fruit, combined with the cereal goodness of Cap'n Crunch."
"Thanks, Kara! Enjoyed 50/50 from the can first and then poured into a glass. In hindsight, I preferred it from the can; as you would expect, there were floaties galore in the glass - doesn't bother me one bit. Not overly turbid or murky. A nice cloudy orange gold. It's such a balanced IPA, it's beautiful. Part crisp citrus, bushy pine, tropical fruit and exquisite bitters, this IPA sings a balanced tune from start to finish. Not too juicy, resiny, bitter or hot. It's the beer that Goldilocks would drink after breaking into the bear's house. Fucking hard to find, for sure, but it really is a treat when you do track it down."
Simply put one of the best IPAs I have had. Consumed from a fresh 16oz can.
"Awesome smell of juiciness ,citra & mosaic hops. Med. mouth feel and nice bitterness . Had this beer when I was in Vermont. I think you only get it in pubs,but that may changed since Oct when I was there. VERY SCARY EASY DRINKING goes down fast."
Definitely better than heady topper
"Definitely enjoyable, but I thought it tasted a bit like Heady's just-a-little-younger brother rather than something that offered its own personality. Lemon and lime were the primary aromas and flavors extracted from the hop profile. Tastes like the conan yeast strain is in there as well."
"Consumed from a can purchased at the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT."
"Probably my favorite single IPA I've had to day. In my opinion it's better than heady topper.very resinous, lots of tropical fruit and citrus. Its a very dry IPA as well. Very crisp another winner from the alchemist."
Lighter then heady topper but very similar.
"L: Hazy gold body with a bubbly white head; decent lacing. Looks great out of the can, but drinks better in the can."
"After drinking HT, figured this we be ...meh. Wrong! Another great tasting Alchemist brew. "
2nd behind The Heady Topper for the best beer.
A: slight haze; medium gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin cap; very nice lacing;
"I can't really say anything about look since it came directly from the can. When I first heard of the Alchemist I couldn't wait to try Heady Topper. The day I had my first Heady, my wife said I looked happier drinking that beer than I did on my wedding day. I can't say I agree but I was pretty pumped. During my most recent trip to Burlington I got to try Focal Banger for the first time. I was taken away by how good the beer was. I'd even go as far to say that it is better than Heady Topper. I just hope that when The Alchemist opens up their brewery that they put more of a focus on getting this beer distributed to places other than restaurants."
Look- Not sure how to rate the look as I got it out of a can. I'm sure it's a pretty brew. Cool artwork.
Top five
Slightly prefer this one over the Topper....more nuanced and drinkable.
"One of the best IPAs I've ever had and right there with Heady as far as Alchemist. Went in not a huge fan of Mosaic , but this changed my mind"
Can at Burlington Airport - The Skinny Pancake.
Good IIPA but coming from the almighty John KImmich of Alchemist Brewing this beer had a lot of hype behidn it and simply did not deliver like Heady does. That being said if you just simply respect quality IPAs then this is nothing short of a damn good IPA that is very drinkable.
Just try it.
"Very delicious beer, procured a can from a nice fellow I met while in Bruges, Belgium. All I can say is we need this in western Canada!"
"A more sessionable heady, nearly perfect in every way...awesome."
"Excellent, but not a Heady Topper"
Another gem found on a 1-day bender through Vermont...in the airport terminal. I had 3 since you can get this via retail locations & drink it in-house only. Also stoked I was the only person in my row on the flight home as the buzz was spectacular & I mos def smelled of glorious beer.
"Finally got to try this at prohibition pig last thursday with dinner. Lives up to ALL of the hype in my opinion, a perfect IPA, has all of the great characteristics of Heady but adds ""otherworldly drinkability"" to the mix. Ended up ordering 3 of them. Cannot wait until this is mass manufactured."
"A. Light bronze color, great effervesce, fine-bubble egg shell head that had good retention."
Heddy lite... But not really lite. A great beer that I'm happy to have. Get it if you can.
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (Jester King stemware, once again). This was purchased about two weeks ago at the Stowe brewery, and has been refrigerated consistently since then. I’d say these are pretty damn good tasting conditions. "
"Hard to rate ""look"" when u drink out of the can"
"Finally getting around to writing a review for this one. I've been fortunate enough to have had several cans of this over the last year. Consumed right out of the can. Upon opening, a huge blast of fresh hops and grapefruit hit the olfactory senses. Unapologetic and assertive hops. Dank and resinous. Juicy and delicious. I'm not saying that this is better than Heady Topper, but like Heady Topper, I feel that this beer is essentially flawless. Every single time I have had it, I have been most impressed. My highest recommendation."
Tropical fruit madness. Out of this world flavor.
One of the best IPA's ever created. Another brew extremely hard to come across.
In your face hop aroma. Citra and Mosaic hops are the profiles that stand out to me. Lots of lemon and mango aroma and flavors with some grapefruit. Bitter and dry finish. I could just smell this beer all day.
"This beer is exceptional, a rare 5.0 beer. I got the chance to taste this and Heady on a vacation trip to Vermont last week. I had the Heady first and will review it later. The local folks recommended I try the Focal since it was only available in restaurants. To my palate, it was sweeter than Heady. Excellent Hop Balance. Very smooth, no notice of alcohol. Do drink it in the can, the Alchemist folks really have mastered World Class beer in a can."
L: Had to give it a 4 because I drank it from the can like it was recommended and have no idea what it looks like in a tulip glass. 
Got the chance to taste focal and heady side by side. Both delivered to the bar that day. If you like one you'll like the other. I found them to be similar except focal was less hoppy tasting and a bit smoother. I thought there was less fruit flavor in the focal. Overall another excellent beer from the alchemist.
"Drank from a 1 pint can at Hen of the Wood, Waterbury, VT"
"Loved this one. Hop profile made this much more floral in nature than heady. It is a different beer than Heady, I would not compare it to that. On its own, it's worth seeking out."
"This was basically a Heady, but with slightly less bite. Better in my opinion"
"I drank it right from the can, as ordered."
"Had at a few locations during a trip to Vermont: Stowe Wine & Cheese (unexpected), Doc Ponds, and Hen of the Wood. Poured some out just to get an idea of looks but kept 95% of it in the can, as specified. Pours a hazy golden color with a decent head that sticks around. Smells of... sweet baby jesus: pure hops. I should call the police because my olfactory cells just got assaulted by an angry mob of hops. Grassy, super herbal, notes of stone fruit. "
A perfect IPA! So juicy
"Had cans in Stowe and Waterbury during a road trip. Great combo of Citra and Mosaic hops. Smells incredibly dank with great citrus notes as well. Tons of citrus hops on the front end, semi-creamy, with a nice dry bitter end. I think I like the hop forwardness more than Heady but I'm just splitting hairs...."
"dank so fkin dank. enjoyed from can at Sherpa Kitchen in Burlington, VT (for only $5). ridiculous nose - predominately citrus and pine, beautiful grapefruit and pineapple scents. the taste is even better than the smell, gushing with tropical fruits. crisp and clean, leaves you craving more after each sip. you cant even slightly taste the alcohol and this beer goes down a little too easy considering its 7%. gotta say in my opinion its better than heady because its in your face but slightly less so. hands down the best beer ive tasted."
YoubrewIdrink brought some of this to the pre-Zeebra extravaganza at the vacation villa resort a few months ago. Good times in an exotic paradise! Cheers! 
"Look: Hazy, beautiful, Golden color, Unfiltered look"
One of the best IPA's I have had and IMO beats HT!!
"Pours a great glowing gold. Tastes of assertive hops, mango and pineapples that is met with some harsh vegetal bitterness that seems to be a characteristic of The Alchemists beers. Focal is great but not a beer that is 100% pleasant."
Hoppier than Heady Topper... And definitely better as well. Hopped with Citra and Mosaic and both of varieties best qualities showed. Tropical fades to juicy berries. Totally unbalanced with all flavor coming from the hops but a retstrained bitterness finishing dry. A treat to have.
Better than Heady Topper. Drank from the can. Can't really judge the look.
"Super dank, tropical and delicious. Turbid as a VT ipa should be. Real good..........................................................................."
"Poured from a can at the Culmination Festival. Tasted alongside Heady Topper and Focal Banger was preferred. Perhaps not as well balanced as Heady, but Focal Banger delivered a crisp bite of Citra/Mosaic that is difficult to beat. Very well done DIPA."
"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Light yellow hazy pour. Smell is citrus and pineapple standing out. Taste is overwhelmingly delicious with bready malts and hoppy bitterness. So well balanced, but slightly favoring the hops. Extremely crisp and flavorful. Can feel that carbonation with a slight bite and peppery mouth-feel. This beer, much like Heady Topper, surpassed my expectations. If you stumble on the chance to try it, it's an absolute must."
Hazy pale color with foamy head. Aroma is somehow spicy with dill and oregano notes. Taste follows with the same herbal notes and some dankness. Bitterness shows up in the finish and follows in the aftertaste but does not overwhelm. Body is quite light and dry. Really easy drinking and refreshing IPA with an interesting hop profile.
"People giving this high ratings for appearance are smoking crack. The number of particles floating in this is like OJ pulp. The color isn't very vibrant but it's fine. Head doesn't stick around long and the lacing is pretty weak. There's no getting around this with a subjective ""I like hazy beers"". The smell is nuanced but subtle. Definitely citrus - mineola tangerine, lemon and orange pith - and a funky vegetation element - wet grass / crushed leaves, maybe even something like zuchini. Flavor delivers more of the same with the vegetation becoming a bit too pronounced, like silage. Body is creamy, almost chewy, soft and round, coating rather than crisp. Finish is a bit flat. I'm picking on this beer a bit simply because I think a lot of the reviews are blind accolades. It's good. It's very good. But it's distinctly ugly and the nose and feel have some serious flaws."
"A beautiful aroma from the can. Very balanced, very crisp and absolutely delicious. A nice blend of hops and fruits with a silk finish, Disappears in no time."
Four days old ... absolutely topnotch!
Was expecting a lot more flavour. No where near Heady in that dept. Prefer a Heady or SOS any day.
"Tasty beer, but the weed/onion smell was a bit overpowering."
Another home run from the Alchemist. Finally got to try this on a recent VT brew run. Tried several spots that had run out but got lucky at the Blackback pub which had some left. Very tasty beer. Smooth with nice flavor. Close to Heady. Did a back to back with Heady and Second Fiddle and it was extremly close. Heady still wins by a nose due to - IMO - better flavor but this is still a top notch brew thats not to be missed if you can get your hands on some.
This beer is amazing!!!
"Light golden orange, cloudy with tiny white suspension. Smell is sweet and fruity. Taste is soft, grapefruit peel and pine, some earthiness with a bitter back end, but not harsh. Great balance on this one. Mouthfeel is near perfect, slick and soft. Overall outstanding IPA."
"Enjoyed a 16oz pour on tap at the 11th Annual Hophead Throwdown this afternoon. I dare say this beer has Heady beat. It's crisper, fresher, and doesn't have that synthetic backend that Heady Topper has. Citra and Mosaic are two hops that fit well together. Beautiful notes of citrus and pine. This beer is dank, fruity, and drier than you'd expect. A fantastic brew that lives up to its hype."
Poured from a can (about a month old) into a tulip glass.
"Glad to finally be able to try this. Had side to side with Heady and while both are great, I prefer this just a tad more. The hop profile seems a bit more complex and I get a bit more citrus. Both are awesome, but given a choice, I would take Focal. Hoping this becomes more available as the new brewery gets up and running."
"Wow, expectations for this beer were very high and it did not disappoint, ignoring the brewer's advice i poured it into a glass, resulting in about a finger and a half of frothy head that remained in big chunks for the duration, color is a cloudy orange, with a greenish yellow tinge. Tons of citrus and tropical notes on the nose, grapefruit, oranges, mango and pineapple are all there. The taste is just like the smell, lots of tropical fruit, with a kick of bitter grape fruit peel cutting through like a knife at the very end, and enough malt to balance out the battle of hops going on. Seriously delicious beer."
Wow- I waited a while to get a fresh can. It is a great IPA. It is up there for single IPAs in the world.. tremendous mouthfeel. Hop aroma is great.. flavor is top notch!
Can taken from Sunset Grille in Stowe VT and poured about 60% of contents into a shaker.
Release 7-27-15. Poured from can. 
got a single surprise can from a friend in Burlington.
"Thanks to frenchyraoul. It says to drink from the can, but I took my chances and poured some into a glass. The new can design is quite nice, though. The beer is yellow, fairly pale, with just a bit of orange to it. Pretty hazy. Big white head. Lots of lacing and very good retention. Big juicy hop aroma. Lots of tropical and citrus fruitiness with a solid resiny backbone running through it. It’s big on pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, mango. Good stuff. The taste has moderate to medium bitterness. Lots of hop flavor. Mild pale malt character. A nice mineral note. Finishes pretty dry. Easy drink. Soft, full mouthfeel. Packs a lot of flavor. It’s a very satisfying IPA. Excellent work from Vermont."
"Just as good, perhaps better than its better known brother, Heady Topper. Highly recommended. Apparently only for sale on-Premises at local restaurants."
"Poured it into a glass, and I'm glad I did. It had the same murky quality of Heady, but the head was beautiful, soft as a pillow, and generous in the lacing it left. The feel was thinner and the taste was pinier than Heady, but it still hit that wow mark that Heady does. Not quite as mindblowing as its older brother, but way closer than I expected it to be."
"I was back in Vermont this month and did the usual ""drink everything you can get your hands on"" tour, and this was my favorite of the bunch- I love having one, maybe two heady toppers, but my palate is pretty much wrecked after that. I could have 6 of these and keep going. They are still very hoppy and run you through a gamut of flavors, but are much more drinkable than their older brother. The can is awesome, too (for those who care)."
had out of a can for look going on person next to me who poured in a glass
"This beer is off the charts. Piney, sweet & balanced. Almost TOO drinkable. I can't wait until the new brewhouse is online so this becomes more widely available!"
"kind of cool how this one is showing up all over the place in vermont now, locals are calling it heady light, but i totally disagree. while it is super drinkable (so is heady in my opinion), its got a totally different hop complexion going on, with the two varietals coming in waves. usually mixes of hops sort of all splash in at once, sometimes harmoniously, sometimes in cacophonous chaos, but this beer has two distinct stages, where the citra comes in first, middle of the beer, with preserved lemon and tart fruitiness, while the mosaic comes on much later, with an only southern hemisphere pineapple tropicality. really fun transition, and the sometimes one dimensional citra is elevated be coming first. the grain base of the beer seems to me relatively nondescript, engineered as a hop platform, not as a major contributor, but there are some light fresh cereals in this and enough texture to hold the hop resins. not as dry as anticipated, but its a fruity tasting sweetness thats left in the end, hoppy for sure, but not wickedly bitter. scary drinkable. i was worried these guys were never going to make anything but heady, so its nice to see this one out there, and its reassuring that its basically just as good as heady. well worth seeking out or trading for, you wont be disappointed."
I actually like this better than the Heady. To me it's lighter on the hops and has a bit more citrus flavor to it. Very good beer.
Prefer over Heady. To me it's a more balanced version with a less aggressive finish.
"Pours a hazy golden color, excellent lacing on the glass. Mosaic comes through beautifully on the nose and shines through on the taste. Smooth mouthfeel with a dank bitter feel. An excellent alternative to its brethren"
"Thick pillow head with great lacing. Pale golden orange. Citrus bouquet on the nose. Fresh juice. Delicious. Mango, orange, and lemon. Nice feel, some sticky tart, and good carb. Great beer, better than Topper."
It's better than Heady Topper.
So yummy! Great beer!
"Wow. Seriously blown away. Easily the best ipa I've ever had. So juicy and hoppy, and dangerously drinkable. Pours a beautiful hazy orange color. Smells like sticking my nose in a bag of hops and passion fruit. Taste follows suit with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel. Seriously my new favorite ipa, and yes, better than heady!"
Another gem from Alchemist !! May I need to say more ??? F. Lighter than the heady S) similar to Heady grapefruit pronounced T) absolutely amazing Hop character and superb front-end bitterness with perfect citrus and mosaic hop balance ! My New Favorite :) wish I could get these in cases !!
"This does not stand in Heady Topper's shadow. It is a little less huge, but equally delicious. So glad I got to try it!"
Fresh out of a can on delivery day in Burlington.
An enlightening UBER religious experience!
"Drank from the can, so appearance is based on the nice can design. "
My favorite beer in the world. Period. And it comes in an awesome new can. Wish I could get it easier.
A superb IPA--big nose.
Review from notes; sticker-labeled can from the first can release into a tulip.
"We must have gotten an off can. The beer did not smell or taste right. I'd have to try it again to five it a fair shake, but this scoring reflects the can I tried."
"Fresh on tap, direct from John Kimmich/The Alchemist at FW Invitational. Bright and radiant sunshine glow with dense 3 finger head and sticky, bubbly lacing remaining all over the glass. Dank, delicious, pungent marijuana aroma with huge blasts of tropical citrus and resinous earthy hops that coat the palate and linger. Next level shit. Consider my focal banged."
"If you could give a 5+, smell deserves it. When fresh, it is euphoric. Nose is full of citrus. Taste has a fresh bitter taste, followed by piney, resinous flavors. Mouthfeel is crisp, but not overly bitter, allowing you to appreciate the next taste."
"We all have our opinions, so take this with a grain of salt, but this is my favorite non-Hill Farmstead IPA coming out of Vermont. Heady Topper is amazing, but this brings all of the luscious goodness of HT with a little less resiny richness and a little more refreshing fruit quality. Simply beautiful."
Heady jr...no more to say
Heaven in a can. Thank you.
"Pours a pale orange hue with a hazy clarity and a half-inch, tight, bright white head. Nose is floral, herbal and earthy with a trace of light toasted malts. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. Overall, quite quaffable. Another great Alchemist offering."
"Solid IPA, I wouldn't categorize it as a citrus bomb, more of a dank, dry grapefruit/piney, solid hoppy kind of beer. Solid, above average! Best of the best?? Debatable"
"Is it wrong to say that this might be better than Heady? I know there is much debate (and not trying to stir the pot here) but, man, is this beer amazing!!! Sweet, dank, fruity and downright delicious. Vermont has been killing it lately and really putting the East Coast on the map in terms of craft beer. And as per usual I drank from the can haha. Go get some ASAP! cheers!"
Smelled like some citrus notes and possibly like grass or pine. Didn't taste much alcohol and it goes down really smooth. I would say it's really well balanced between all the sweetness and bitterness. Very hoppy and delicious!
"Run along, heady, it's past your bedtime. Brilliant orange appearance. Peach and pineapple all the way through. Best IPA ever."
"Reflecting on this awesome beer today and really glad I have a few extra in my fridge for my consumption after excluding certain BA reviewers (Brad) from the invite list of this party. Some people think the number of reviews make them more important, but everyone knows it's the number of beers consumed that differentiates the cool kids from the strange ones."
I picked this up in a trade with BostonHoppa on 4/26/2015.
I think I prefer Focal Banger even to Heady. It is a little less ABV and so drinkable. Very hoppy with a nice clean finish and mouthfeel. I wish they would distro this beer as I have only found it in VT restaurants and hotels and would love to buy by the case. Much recommended.
"An excellent IPA. It doesn't carry the same depth or complexity as Heady, but will certainly enjoy again. Hopefully many times"
"So much hype surrounding this brew and my body was ready. Had half in a glass and half in the can. Murky, more of a bright yellow/golden color. Really has that NE vermont taste that's sweet but dank and juicy. Wanted so much to fall in love but it just didn't happen...more of a one night stand."
Strong citrus flavor highlighted by lychee and grapefruit with virtually no bitterness. One of the better beers I've ever tasted
Did not follow instructions with this can. 8 ozs. in a teku to rate the look. Did not factor into my overall score for the beer because instructions say to drink from the can
"A case study in hopping the ever loving shit out of a beer with Citra. Sure, it smells nice. But, its body has an off-putting thinness, and though I understand the desire to go bare bones and basic with the malt backdrop, it creates a certain astringency that I do not enjoy."
"Very similar to big brother HEADY except focal is slightly more drinkable IMO, with the less abv. Very very very good brew and gives heady a run!"
One of the best beers i have ever tasted. I love this one and wish it was an everyday beer. Much the same as Heady i think they know what they are doing. Home run once again
"On a aroma scale of 5, I would give this a 10. I think this is better than (dare I say it) Heady Topper. Easily my favor beer from The Alchemist."
"My desert island beer. Balanced, juicy, and incredibly cravable."
This just might be the perfect IPA
"Can shared by Collin. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Fruity hop aromas. Grapefruit hop notes dominate. Good balance, body, and mouthfeel. Very nice.."
"so close to perfect! no booze flavor, just lovely hops and malt. beautiful, unfiltered look. followed by a lovely nose full of fruit and hops. and the taste that follows is such a impeccable balance of hops and malt. i highly recommend this one"
"Is it really that good? Yes. It certainly is. You want fruit? You got it. Want hops? They're there. Fancy bitter flavors, galore. It really is all that."
"My new favorite, hands down. I think that this brewery has discovered what alchemy really is, 'cuz they turn aluminum into gold...wonderful. Tropical Cornucopia with a well-hidden earthiness that pops out at the finish. Heaven"
"Pours from the can a hazy gold with a bubbly white head. The nose is full of pineapple and mango, with floral notes and a touch of malt. The hops are more noticeable in the taste, but the tropical fruits are still there, along with hibiscus. There is an enticing dankness here. Medium light mouth, and the carbonation gives it a crispness. This is an excellent beer."
"Even after 2 months, this holds up to any IPA. Lots of pine and resin balanced with citrus in the background. Very glad there was one more behind this one."
16oz can poured into a globe.
"Awesome, beautiful beer. So different from a Julius or Susan that I can't Even believe they are ranked together."
Drinking the first 1/3 or so from the can and then pouring the rest into a Dogfish IPA glass.
Can: Poured a clear light yellow color ale with a nice white foamy head with excellent retention and some great lacing. Aroma of huge floral notes of grass notes with some light resinous notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by an all-out hops assault with tons of grassy notes with light limey notes and some resinous hoppy notes. Residual sugar can be detected but doesn’t stray the taste from the hoppy notes. Body is about average with great carbonation. Very enjoyable but almost close to being unbalanced with those sharp hoppy notes.
"Don't be fooled by the reviews. This is not better than heady. Not a bad beer by any means but, definitely a notch below big brother heady"
IN my opinion this is every bit as good as Heady Topper! Love this stuff!!!!
"Can from Steve, many thanks to you!"
"Super hoppy, nice pale cloudy beer with a creamy white head. Lots of grapefruit. Really nice finish. No long lasting bitterness. Nice crisp finish."
"This is a good IPA, very nice flavor profile. Its definitely a hoppy beer. Its not as fruity as I like my IPA's to be. But it is well made. It has the blend of malts and hops but leans on the side of earthy hoppiness rather the fruity juicy flavors. "
Poured into a tulip from a can
"The color is a very murky medium yellow, completely opaque except at the edges. The head is a fluffy, rocky and very dense one that's very close to pure white with the slightest yellow tint. IT finally rests at no less than 1/4 finger but it's a thick and heavy pillow that remains, dropping lace in a blend of spotting and netting as it does."
"This is the perfect IPA. Well-balanced, hop-forward without being obnoxiously so, pours with incredible white head and a citrusy taste with the lightest pine bite that completely disappears almost as quick as it pops up. If I was to bring one beer on a desert island, this would be it. I didn't think much could tango with Heady, but this takes the cake for me."
"Massive tropical fruit aromas and flavor. Huge orange, grapefruit, mango and pineapple notes. Much less piney than Heady Topper."
It's fantastic. Second only to the crusher in my opinion. My wife keeps giving cans to people for gifts since it's holiday time. I had to hide it in the garage.
"Apparently BA's ""Phone friendly"" interface refuses to post reviews written on iOS? Whatev..."
This is as good as it gets for an IPA for me. First had it from the October 2014 truck sale and it blew me away. Easily better than Heady and the Crusher. Can't wait until the Alchemist is able to crank out more of this wonderful stuff.
"Pours a pale orange with a thick white head. Aroma of grapefruit pith with a hint of pine. Lots of juicy hops on the palate with floral, pine and earthy notes. Light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I'd call this Heady Light."
16 ounce can poured into a pint glass.
"Thanks again to Joe_Grizzly for drowning me in Alchemist, really looking forward to this one. I got your Silver Bullet right here, mother….16 oz. can dumped into my purty Kuhnhenn glass. "
"Better than heady for me. I have had this beer 3-4 times and it never disappoints. Wish they would put a date on the can. Great aroma of citra and mosaic, light and smooth just how I like my IPAs"
16 oz. can from the 10/4/14 Alchemist Truck sale. Poured into a snifter glass on 10/26/14.
Almost hard to beleive theres not acutual grapefruit in this one. Another great beer from The Alchemist.
Another great juicy IPA from the Alchemist. The aroma and flavor of hops in this beer is over the top. Damn near perfect.
Poured from 16 oz can into pint glass. 
"16oz can, poured into a tulip glass"
Pours a light straw yellow with white soapy foam--
Poured from the can into a pint glass.
"A-Cloudy deep orange, two finger head with nice lacing."
"I've heard by many that this beer surpasses Heady Topper. I'm a huge fan of anything brewed with Citra or Mosaic so I had to give it a try. While quite good, I find something very slightly off with the way the hops mingle in the after taste. Will definitely drink again, but IMO, I still prefer Heady."
"Pretty tasty, but not as good as heady. Last 4oz of the can was undrinkable due to floaties & sludge."
"Nice white head, great golden straw color, aroma & flavor of citrus. Great overall beer with nice mouthfeel and think it's quite sessionable but the hop flavor and aroma seem a tad muted versus other IPAs that are similar. Much prefer Alpine IPAs, but good IPA regardless."
A: Poured into a tulip glass. Poured with a nice white head. The beer was light golden/straw colored with a good amount of haze. Nice looking beer.
"Focal Banger, Poured in a tulip glass"
"16 oz. can gifted from GMRFx, unknown can date but purchased at the most recent Alchemist tent sale on 08/11/2014, poured into a small plastic glass at a BJCP study group, drank 08/27/2014 over an hour."
"From the can. Aroma is super juicy with notes of blueberry, mango, and a touch of orange peel. Had to pour some out to get the appearance. It's cloudy and a golden yellow much like Heady. Taste is bursting with tropical fruit flavors, pineapple, oranges, mango, and a hint of piney bitterness. Medium body with moderately low carbonation. Overall another outstanding IPA from Alchemist. Worth seeking out."
"A: Hazey, Golden Orange, Cloudy, 2 finger white head, decent lacing and a medium-medium/high carbonation."
Nice citrus nose
"This beer is amazing. Consistently the best from the Alchemist collection, perhaps one of the best in the world. "
"Deep golden with orange hues, big white fluffy head and tons of lacing. Big nose filled with citrus, tropical notes, slight sweetness, big resinous hop aroma. Taste doesn't disappoint. Citrus ranging from grapefruit to orange and even some lemon. Tropical, pineapple and mango notes. Honey like sweetness to the malt bill which stands perfectly to the huge hop flavors. Great finish of hop flavor, not overly bitter. Fuller side of medium body with a sticky sweetness, starts creamy smooth and finishes dry. This is an amazing IPA, Alchemist has a way with hops."
the crushers little brother (?)
"When it comes to hops, Alchemist knows how to get the good ones and knows how to use them once in the brewhouse. This IPA of ultimate dryness and utter hop dominance brings out a taste in pale ale that's likely not yet been seen, better yet- tasted."
"The best. Better than Heady, Pliny, or Crusher. Lots of hops, but not over the top. Not too thick like a lot of doubles. Just perfect."
"All hail the Alchemist. This is THE example of an excellent IPA in the single/low double range. Pours a hazy yellow with strong head retention. Sipping on this is like riding a hop rollercoaster. As the sip works its way down the flavor changes a few times, starting as an intense yet well rounded piney citrus to mellow grassy notes to an intense, full, life altering multi-hop finish. One of my all time favorites, if you like IPAs you will love this. If heady is a 100 focal banger is a 101!"
"This poured with a brilliant pineapple yellow color with a thick head of densely knit, bright white foam."
Thanks to RichOBrien for having the chance to drink this beer.
Tallboy can courtesy of Mike.
"Pours a totally hazy, gold/lemonade color. Long lasting head. Hoppy aromas jump out of the glass, juicy, sticky and fresh sliced fruit. Flavor has a crisp malt backbone but generous hops are piled on. The result is a damn tasty IPA but not as good as Heady."
16 oz can poured into a Belgian Ale glass.
"Really nice hoppy IPA. Had it side to side with Heady Topper, and this one is the little sis."
Really just an outstanding beer. 
"Big hop aroma, the Citra has been tamed. Lasting head on yellow body, leaving a lace trail. Citra dominated taste, rounded out by subordinate tropical fruit. Fresh tasting, a good complement in the product line to the Heady Topper. Can from Tom, thank you."
A: hazy dull golden-yellow.
Appearance is a cloudy yellow color with a one finger fluffy head.
"A- Pours a nice golden/orange with a little haze to it, about a finger and half of white frothy head forms that has excellent retention slowly receding to a thin layer."
STYLE American IPA | ABV 7.0% | AVAILABILITY Year-round 
"Had this before they designed the new can. I almost prefer it to Heady but both are very very good. I wish I could have it again. Dry hop smell, crisp flavor, very balanced beer."
Obtained via trade with BA iamjo- Thanks for the killer package dude! 
"Did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper."
"Can from MrBarleywine, thanks for the hookup Mike!"
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, hazy, lemon yellow coloring with a dense, foamy, frothy, bright white head. Aromas of key lime, tangerine, pine resin, and a solid bitterness, all on a light, toasted backbone. Flavors are tremendous, with a blast of tart lime and grapefruit, followed by a solid, rich, sticky, dank blast of resinous bitter. Holy hell. There is a subtle cracker backbone, but this is a compliment at best to the barrage of citrus and sticky hops characteristics coming at you. Wow. Robust, yet light bodied, which keeps the drinkability through the roof. The aftertaste is surprisingly subtle, in comparison, with subtle grass, tart grapefruit, and hints of bitterness. Smooth, slightly dry finish. Just a damn near perfect beer in this can right here!"
"Poured from a can obtained at the Alchemist truckload sale. Cloudy yellow/orange color with a creamy head that lingered to the end, with nice lacing. A big bouquet of fresh citrus, and truly original scent. Smooth with a bit of carbonation. Grapefruit, and pine, subdued malt and grain, and a nice bitter finish. Another home run from the Alchemist, which I would gladly stock in the fridge if readily available. Heady light? No way. Get it, try it."
Edit: 5/29
"Can brought back to me from the truck sale, and poured into my Hill Farmstead stemware."
"I picked this up at a pop up location where Beelzebub and Heady Topper were sold, enjoyed chilled from the can in a glass."
Acquired at a can sale today.
16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
Huge thanks to hoppypocket for throwing in this as an amazing extra!
1785th Review on BA
"This pours out as a hazy golden color with a frothy white head. The smell of the beer is crazy aromatic, the taste is crazy flavorful. The mouthfeel is smooth, overall this is awesome. There isn't much to complain about here."
"A-Pours a murky, pale yellow color. Looks like fruit juice. Smaller head sits atop the hop oil-laden body. Very light lace."
The beer comes in a bright golden orange with tons of particle matter in there.
"A- Golden honey, lots of head with medium retention. "
Canned about a week ago.
"The Alchemist - Focal Banger, poured into a Lawson's Tulip."
Tallboy can poured into Duvel Tulip.
"Poured from a can, third time trying this one. "
"Nice head, with good retention. White, thick lacing. Cloudy golden with light orange appearance. Nose is full fruity hop aroma. Taste is very fruity with more hop bitterness than Heady, which I think is a good think. Smooth mouthfeel, with long-lasting finish of puckering hop bitterness. I think I actually prefer Focal Banger to the much-lauded HT because of what I perceive as more bittering hops."
Poured from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.
A- Pours a mostly clear golden straw color with a good sized fluffy white head that retains pretty well and leaves patchy lacing.
Served from a pint can with a sticker on it into a Alchemist Becher glass.
Can into Alchemist stemless.
"Pour is reasonably hazed peachy gold with a tight white head. Nose is loads of citrus hops with grapefruit and peach. Taste follows the nose, loads citrus, peach and grapefruit. Very dry and clean, well carbonated and lighter body. A lot like a slightly lower alcohol heady with a bit more fruity punch but less bright hop flavor."
Poured from a 16 ounce can into a pint glass. This was released a week ago today so is quite fresh.
"Focal Banger pours a hazy honey yellow with a small, creamy head on top. The foam fades quickly leaving spots of lace all over the glass."
"Poured into my 13 oz tulip glass, I know it is fresh. Pours a hazy yellow orange with some floaties and a two inch white head that leaves loads of lace. Smell is tropical mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and a hint of grapefruit. Taste follows the nose everything thing blends perfectly, maybe a little more grapefruit lingers on the tong then you would expect from the nose. Body is medium large for its abv, plenty of life, a touch dry, and amazing drinkability. One of the best ever, as I expected."
Pours an apricot-orange with pure white foamy head.
"16oz can, 1/4 into tasting glass, 3/4 from can."
"Poured from the can into a tulip glass. I like the looks of it. Murky, bright orange wih a nice one finger head. Smell is very vibrant, grapefruit and pine mostly. Very juicy. There is a lot of flavor in this ipa. Everything from the aroma comes through. Very resonious. Mouthfeel is very slick and creamy, hops just hang around for days on the taste buds. There isn't a ton of tropical flavors, or really anything special, but there is a ton of flavor here and I love it. Just a well done, grassy/piney ipa with a touch of grapefruit. Similar to HT, but not as heavy"
"Great deal of hype surrounding this one, much due to the notoriety of Heady Topper. If they can make such an outstanding DIPA, why not an AIPA? Well, I must say, as much as I wanted to love Focal Banger, it severely underwhelmed me unlike their previous draft release, Ourborous. "
"I wasn't able to get any of the canned release on Saturday, Feb. 15, so I consoled myself over a fresh pour at The Reservoir in Waterbury while watching the Canada/ Finland hockey game."
Poured from the 16 oz. can into a large tulip.
"16oz silve can with just a sticker for a label, picked up yesterday at the outdoor Alchemist release. Poured into a willi becher pint glass."
"Can, thanks to blckout20! Appearance: Nice pale golden pour with thin white head. Aroma is very fruity (mango, banana, oranges), some light dank hops and some biscuit malts / graham crackers. Taste is fruity, moderate to high bitterness and a tad too sweet. Carbonation is rather low. I'm being picky here as I'm comparing it to HT. Not nearly as powerful and resinous as Heady, but a very good highly drinkable IPA."
"12oz poured on tap in Waterbury, VT. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass today, 2/12/2014. "

The first words that came out my mouth when I drank this beer was Whoaaaa!!!..This might be the closest your going to get to The Header.. I hate comparing everything to the highest rated beer BUT.. When you had the best??? This beer had a nice fruity IPA taste to it.. Leaves a great taste lingering in your mouth.. The Alchemist Brewery nailed it with this one..
A- cloudy golden hue with undertones of orange. Light white and moderately dense
abv of 6.2
"This is my first review, I just had to add this one after trying it this weekend..."
"A strong pour was needed for a finger sized rocky off white head with average retention and spotty lacing. A cap lasted to the bottom. Labeled can,10/30/18. "
A-Pours a very hazy yellowish golden color with a generous head and lacing
Had on tap at TH. As hyped... and one of the quintessential NEIPAs. This beer leaps with hop complexity and tasty bitterness. 
"This is one of my favorite beers in the world. When I'm sitting at work and thinking about coming home to my beautiful wife, my beautiful house, the dogs and the wood stove, this beer ranks high in the image. Amazing!"
The beer pours a pale orange/golden color with a two finger pillowy head that is tenacious. The beer looks thick and creamy. It clings stubbornly to the glass on each sip all the way to the bottom.
look: hazy peach or maybe orange juice with pulp. 
"In my very humble opinion, the best beer produced by this excellent facility. I have had many of the others, but here is perfection in a glass. Piney, resinous, tropical fruit. A hint of bitterness. A creamy mouthfeel. All in balance, all part of a flavor profile that will haunt you when you have none left."
"12/2014 - this is super fresh and tasty! Pineapple, some peach, some hoppy aromas with Galaxy popping nicely; slightly sweet, clean, hoppy, juicy flavors on the palate; dank, yet creamy, slightly sweet, juicy finish."
Pours hazy yellow with nice head. Great looking hazy beer.
From a can dated 8/22/18 from jdell15.
"Green pours murky and hazy, light straw yellow with a tight 1-finger head which lingers leaving good lacing. Smell is juicy tropical and citrus with sweet pineapple, mango and ripe tangerine. There is a creamsicle hint to Green with a an earthy mate and touch of pine. Taste is quite bitter up front, for a NE style IPA, but has pineapple, papaya, tangerine and orange rind. The creamsicile seems to fade giving way a to bubblegum characteristic, as this a smoothness settles over your tongue and palette."
"This can is officially 3 months old today, so while the look and smell are pretty wonderful, the taste is underwhelming to say the least. "
16 oz can into IPA glass. Dated 8/6/18.
"Officially one of the top beers I’ve had. Pours a turbid light straw yellow with a tight white head. Nose is a light pleasant pine, grass scent. Almost like a pleasant air freshener or piney candle scent. Obviously to some that might be unpleasant but it really is welcoming and pleasant to smell. So on to taste! Perfect 5! And I struggle to give any aspect a"
"Aside from the slightly muted yet amazing aroma, I would say this is a perfect beer. It literally tastes like it’s something from a higher being. It has aspects of fresh squeezed pineapple juice along with hints of super fresh crackers that one would find on a cheese plate. There is an amazing dank green smell and taste from the hops that is so smooth and subtle. Trying to explain this is hard so here is my way of describing the taste:"
"A really nice new england ipa. Lots of fruit up front and a refreshing bitterness throughout the swallow. I just gave Longtrail 's VT IPA a 4.5. I am not tasting them side by side but i think this has more fruit, maybe not on the citrus side but more melon. If i could get it in town I'd certainly buy more. Treehouse has a kind of cult following. People make the hour trek from hartford or boston to Charlton to get this brew so it's worth grabbing some if you can."
"Pours a hazy orange with a two inch white head that was well retained and left lots of lacing. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits, hints of malt and earth. Tastes of tangerine, orange rind, pineapple, mango, peach, herbal and earthy notes along with a hint of malt. Mild bitterness, medium bodied, creamy mouth feel, light to moderate carbonation."
"a: super hazy muted orange color that has a combination of dark caramel in her as well. 2 finger, frothy vibrant white head"
"Very, Very good IPA. Not as good as Haze but still stellar. Nice citrus flavors and good happiness that an IPA should have."
"A nice departure from the overly juicy beers one expects from TH. It is more complex and bitter than most of their offerings, save Sap, and it is delicious because of that."
"16 oz can, into glass"
Good. But not worth the hype. To explain its like expecting a Pliny and drinking a Sierra Nevada pale ale. It’s good but not close to its rating
Bit of bitterness on the back of the tongue. Still pleasing to drink.
"Solid, nice hops but not one of my favorites from Treehouse. It just didn't stand out the way I thought it would. A bit less mouthfeel and body than I expected."
"Can dated July 6, 2018. Many thanks to Anthony for gifting me my first Treehouse can. "
My first TH from friend. Outstanding hazy golden color with lacing poured in a pint glass as you drink. Pungent hop/citrus aroma follows with a mouthful with a smooth citrus taste that settles on the tongue and palette. Not bad but not to stand in line for. I'll have to try other varieties when I can.
"Meh. Considering just the beer itself compared to other similar this is OK but nothing special as to look, smell, taste or mouthfeel - just one of the crowd. However when you take into account the fact you have to drive to the middle of nowhere, stand in line 30 to 45 minutes and pay approx $4/can for it, it's ""value"" rating sinks far below 3.5. Just not worth it with all the interesting and well crafted beers out there available from your more local brewers, or retail or big box stores sometimes at a buck or three less per can."
Canned on 6/21/18
OVERRATED.
Canned 19 days ago.
"tree house nails the grain makeups of these hazy beers, i think thats what sets them apart, and while it seems weird to call out the grain first in an ipa like this that is so brilliantly hoppy and bright, i think its the support and balance from the malts, and the smooth frothing texture they provide, that make these tree house beers in a league of their own. i feel like the hopping times and ratios and everything can be easily repeated, but its these mashes that are unique to me. this one is a little thicker than some of the others in appearance, paler whiter straw color with a creamy and tall white head. the nose is all hops, mosaic and galaxy maybe, slight cat pee to it for a second but then a ton of melon and pineapple and even mango, vegetal and green but without the burn so many of these that have too many hops in them have, white grape, a cool almost jelly bean sort of candied orange thing, and a remarkable freshness. its juicy to the highest degree, but uniquely balanced by the grain in a way that we rarely see in these hazy ipa types. super fresh, supremely well carbonated, a long flavor journey, and a on of depth to both the malt base and the hop profile. stupidly drinkable for its size too. thanks to my homie back east for sending out some of these cans, i have been loving all of them and learning for myself that they hype is well warranted!"
Poured from the can into a tulip.
"A: The beer is cloudy light yellow in color. It poured with a finger high white head that gradually died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and lacing around the edges of the glass."
Look: Poured from Green can into Treehouse pint glass. Can had canning date of 5/23/2018 on bottom. Pours a cloudy light orange opaque color with a creamy settled head.
"Green is growing on me. Originally I did not think much of it, compared to e.g. Julius it seemed to lack character and depth. However, the more I have had it the more I like it. The mouthfeel is amazing, like a pillow. It is a a big hoppy IPA, but most of all SMOOTH!!!! Galaxy is a tricky hop, it smells great, but often results to completely undrinkable beer. Green is actually the first Galaxy beer that I have liked. It is a bit delicate, if you get less than fresh can of green it will taste like a middle of the road New England IPA. I may still change my mind, but at the moment each can of Green has been better than the last."
"Super hoppy, maybe a little too bitter for my taste but still really good."
Poured into Teku glass from a 16oz can. Looks like Orange/Pineapple juice.
"Definitely tropical, possibly a little too much of a weed funk goin on for me."
"Can: Poured a hazy/cloudy opaque dirty beige color ale with a slightly off-white foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry hops notes with some dank aromas and light citrusy notes. Taste is mostly dominated by dry dank notes with dry citrusy notes, some very light residual sugar notes with a dry finish. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Probably one of my least favorite TH beer with fruity/tropical notes not as pronounced as I was expecting."
"Poured from can into tulip good 1 finger cream colored head, so so retention, good lacing. Turbid orange in the glass. Smell is orange, pineapple and some vegetal hops. Taste is orange and pineapple, bitterness is up front and sharp. I find the hop astringency in the middle a little overwhelming. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, I get the orange sherbert references. Finishes with a dry peppery finish and some mild hop burn. I have a couple more in the fridge, will try them later in the week and see if I was just having an off nite."
My favorite offering from one of my favorite breweries. An incredible juiceness- bitterness ratio. Best if both worlds
Compared side by side with several other competitors within the NE IPA style category and this was the best of the bunch. Shockingly crisp and smooth for its ABV. I could drink this all day and all night. A worthy contender for not only best NE IPA but best IPA.
Really an excellent display of galaxy good. The pineapple and citrus are completely brought forward with a nice light malt background that really compliments the character of this beer.
One of my favorite from Tree House
"This is one of my favorite beers. If u have a chance, try one or two...."
good stuff
A: Beer pours a hazy yellowish orange body. Strong pour gave a solid two fingers' worth of white head. Lots of lacing left behind on the side of the glass while drinking. 
Its almost as good as riverwalk’s turbine!
This beer used to be one of my fav's when brewed at Monson now being brewed out of Charlton it is extremely average and disappointing. Very sad where this brewery has gone.
GREAT
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/8/2018. Pours opaquely hazy golden orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 7.5%. Overall this is an insane NEIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink, with the mildly bitter/drying finish, never aggressive. Amazing soft spot on mouthfeel for the style. Extremely juicy, vibrant, and dank/earthy balanced hop complexity; great bready malt backbone, not overly sweet/heavy. A highly amazing offering, and perfect style example. One of the best I have had."
"The beer by which all others should be benchmarked. Velvet mouth feel, with a taste that exudes passion fruit, mango and stone fruit, the smell promises so much that you might worry the taste can't deliver on - don't worry, the taste over delivers. The juiciest, haziest number I've ever had the luck to drink."
"Picked-up a case at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for about four dollars per can. This is my third review from these guys. Outstanding, Would: will:buy/trade/eat/smuggle/worship/bury/talkto etc. again."
"All time favorite, better than Julius."
Poured into a 13 oz Tired Hands Teku glass canned on 3/08/18. Pours like a glass of pineapple orange juice with a massive 2 plus finger sticky white head that leaves a thin wall of lace behind as it slowly settles into a thin layer of bubbles.
"Really beautiful pour of light orange. Opaque with a white one finger fluff. Disappears quickly but the lacing is phenomenal, leaving artwork on the glass. Citrus on the nose with some stone fruit. Taste follows the nose and this is where the brew really shines. Lots of well balanced flavours and a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is amongst the best I've encountered. "
On Tap at the brewery. Melon Bomb. Nose could improve as it is very mild and non descript
This is dank! A bitter bouquet of super juicy and lush GREEEN!
"16 oz can, dated 2/21/18, poured into a teku"
Can received in trade - excellent balance
Canned 2/8/18; drank 2/26/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"16oz can thanks to Steve. Pale golden pour with hazy body. Small airy head. Big dank hoppy aroma, sweet caramel malts. Taste continues, perfectly blended hops and malt. Just nice all the way through."
Got on trade for a Pliny the Elder... fair trade on first taste. 
On draft one of the best beers I’ve ever had. 
"Pours an opaque, bright orange with a hint of yellow. Head formation is one finger in height after a slow, conservative pour straight into the glass. Head is white, with good retention and lacing. Aroma is a citrus minefield, sprinkling notes of orange, papaya, and mango over a doughy biscuit malt base. Aroma is well crafted, with a modest appeal. It's not loud, or brash, or over stuffed with citrus puree. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, mango, lemon zest, and a dash of grapefruit. Flavor profile packs considerably more notes than the aroma, carrying the 7.5% ABV beer well. There is a touch of bitterness at the finish of this beer. Malts are present, but stuffed well behind the hops storyline. Malts hit notes of biscuit, and bread. Mouth feel is just a touch fizzy, and grainy, but otherwise crisp. Its medium thickness leaves a little residue on the tongue, generating a long lasting flavor and presence on the palate. Overall, a well crafted, balanced NE IPA. It hits balanced citrus notes well, without being over the top or a show-off."
"From a can into a tulip glass, hazy as expected, tropical...expectations maybe were too high for this heralded star of new school ipa"
"Canned 1/4/18 (I believe, possibly 1-2 days off). Consumed on Super Bowl Sunday, 2/4/18. "
Looks like a pulpy juice color. Almost smoothie looking thick. Thin white head. 
Edit : best with 3 months of age on it. 
"Pours hazy cloudy orange with a 1 finger white head. Aroma- mango, orange, pineapple, a little raspberry, and fresh hops! Taste-mango, pineapple, orange pith, grapefruit. Some sappy hop flavor. Mild bitterness in the middle and end. digging the biscuity flavor too. Mouthfeel is pretty pillowy, but a mild zing on the carbonation. Overall- good tasting beer. Nice balance. Not quite as juicy"
another killer brew from treehouse.
"Overall great taste and finish. Not a huge nose but taste is full of happiness. Excellent, but I prefer the alter ego and the Mosaic hops aroma. So far tree house is 2 for 2. Such well balanced and great tasting ipa's."
Another great one
Poured from a 16 oz can dated 1/03/18 into a Willi Becher pint glass.
"Just yummy delicious, juicy, hoppy goodness!"
"Just one of the best beers of all time, hands down."
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
"Yellow with a sort of brown tinge, completely solidly cloudy with no visible carbonation. Topped with 3 fingers of white head, tinged with the same colour as the body."
"11/17/17 ""this green pounds!!!"" I tried some of my allotment fresh, some with time to mellow out."
Wow. The smell is incredible....and on top of that it matches the taste. Bravo TH!
This is probably my favorite TH brew I've had. It just nails everything - absolutely fantastic.
"A hazy mango papaya pour with a rather fast dissipating rocky white head. A dank melon, mango, and papaya aroma with a cream vanilla note that blends it all together. Just like the aroma the taste is dank, creamy, and smooth. The same notes in the aroma are present in the taste. Dank Juice. Nice and smooth and easy drinking. Overall this beer doesn't disappoint and is a must try."
Looks :perfect
"Appearance: I cant help it, these hazy beers are just ugly."
"Great IPA from top to bottom, the aroma comes the instant the can is opened."
"16oz can. Pours a opaque pale orange with over an inch of frothy head. Tons of lacing. Juicy and dank aroma. Pineapple, tangerine and lime. The taste is more of the fruits. Pineapple followed up by tart tangerine and lime. Some grapefruit pith as well. Dank hop notes towards the end with more pineapple. Oily mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Mild alcohol presence."
One of the best IPAs out there.
Dank pineapple juice.
"Thick haze, white thick head. Very aromatic up front. Great mouth feel, bitterness and hop feel. Eberything works great! Loving this hazy IPA. Can see why it scores so high."
Outstanding!
Tall can...10/31/17..thanks to my beer buddy Josh for bringing back a few TH cans for me.
"Pours a uniformly very cloudy straw/orange colour with a medium tall head which fades fairly quickly down to just a light covering which remains while drinking. Some light lacing remains in thin sheets. Aroma upon opening is of grapefruit and other juicy citrus (orange, passionfruit). Taste is very juice forward - grapefruit, orange, pineapple, perhaps others, with the addition of a light grassiness before fading into a sweet juicy mild bitterness which lingers after each sip. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly full with a light tingling from carbonation. This is my first beer from Tree House & it is very nice. As GTAer, it immediately reminds me of Bellwoods IPAs with their classic juice-like qualities. I was able to trade for this with Steve - thanks Steve - some day during my annual drives out East I will make it to Tree House!"
Best of the regular rotation.
Phenomenal. A numbah one!
"From the can...Hazy, yellow color with a thick white head; Fruity smell (pineapple/peach/orange). Smooth, thick and fruity with slightly bitter hops on the end. Excellent."
"On draft, pours a hazy, almost milky orange. Nice head of foam leaves scads of lacing. Smell is tangerine, orange tropical fruits and a bit of bubblegum. Taste is all the fruit and some resinous pine. Decently bitter. Soft, smooth feel. Stellar."
"What can be said about this beer that hasn't already been said. When you sip the beer you can TELL it's intensely hopped, but the hops come through as soft pineapple and oranges. There's a sharpness there, but it's completely dulled by the waves of tropical fruit bubblegum. When the New England IPA craze dust settles, Green will stand alongside the likes of Heady Topper and Pliny as timeless beers. "
Look- I've been told many beers look like orange juice. I've seen some that have those characteristics. This really looks like OJ
I loved the earthiness of this beer. Very good!
Canned on 8/30/17; consumed on 9/23/17.
"A 1 pint can, canned on 27th July 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass."
Pours murky peach or golden wheat fields (SRM 3). The white creamy head reaches a half inch for about a minute before settling to a thin blanket. Fine lace coats a Spiegelau IIPA glass.
"L: Murky (hazy), pale orange with copious white foam. It is a beautiful beer to look at."
Canned 2 weeks ago and tried alongside a can of 2-week-old Julius and 1-week-old DDH Congress St.
16oz can dated 8/30/17.
Meh!
"this beer has been rated a thousand times by people with much better palettes and tastes than i. However, this is a great beer with a distinct color and flavor and worthy of most of this praise. I would not rate it as 100 as i feel its not a perfect beer. It is more subtle and quite a bit less fruity, and the taste is almost more natural and earthy."
"L: very hazy, light amber in color with a pale straw/off-white head. tight lacing, but the head dissipates to a thin 1/8 inch layer"
"Can shared by Dave, Thanks for the opportunity!"
"Oh, yeah...totally worthy of the BA Score 100."
Okay so this can of Green was canned on 11/01/2016... no expectations but immense curiosity! Definitely plan on comparing to a fresh can.
A - opaque yellow-orange-amber color with a milky white head that sticks and leaves great lacing
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into a snifter. The beer pours a very hazy goldenrod color with a fluffy bleached white head of 2 cm that fades gradually to a clingy edge layer and a few wispy islands. This foam sticks around for the sampling and leaves some dense lattice after each sip.
can dated 7.27.17 so fresh and so green green
"Though told to wait, I drank the day after canning and am confident that this is the perfect beer. It opens with grassy and pine notes along with a little bit of peach before descending into pure juice and finishing with a fruity sticky bitterness. Extremely powerful hop presence so it's not exactly crushable but is still a treat I will happily search for again."
Draft Pour
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky yellow with white head. Robust fruity aroma with orange peel, lemon, pineapple. Pretty heavily bitter. Flavors of citrus with some pine and resin on finish. Excellent tasting bitter IPA."
Fresh comes to mind when sipping on this American style IPA. Enjoyed it thoroughly with a great after taste. It was my first beer from Tree house last year and all I can do is try to get my hands on whatever they are currently offering.
Had it once and it was very nice.
"This is by far the best galaxy hopped ipa I've ever had. The key element with the treehouse beers is the mouthfeel. Full creaminess and perfect balance. The once aspect that most amateur NE Style brewers miss is balance. I have had many NE England IPAs that are overly sweet (like a milk stout). Green does have bitterness, which is great because an IPA should have some bitterness."
Cloudy straw appearance with significant white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a mild citrus without any hoppyness. Taste is a very pleasant citrus with a hoppy accent.
A - Pours a turbid gold with a two finger foamy white head. The head leaves a nice amount of soapy lacing.
"From fresh 2 yeek old can. Thanks Ed! Classic NE look, very hazy straw color, creamy head. Smells very potent, lots floral notes. Taste is semi bitter, slightly sweet and lots of unique hoppy flavors I can't pinpoint. Not as much Citrus as I'd expect but it's there in the ballence. Mouth full and feel is great, creamy, thick resonis. Overall this IPA is as good if not better then its hype. Extreamly crushable yet thick and full bodied. 7.5% can't tell till the end. I'm a drinker of GREEN for life if I can get it down South. 4.80"
"Smell: Melon, mandarin oranges, pineapple, mango, bubblegum, a hint of malt, super juicy. It smells amazing!"
Of all the TH regulars Green really stands out. Thick and with the consistency of orange juice I've never been more impressed with the flavor that can be packed into an IPA. Doubleganger is the only one that beats it in my opinion but that's a DIPA. Beats out Julius for me
"In short smells wonderful but a touch muted when it came to flavor. Perfection when it came to mouthfeel, both creamy and effervescent. Top notch guv'na!"
This was a draft pour from their new Charlton location.
A: a nice 2 finger fluffy white head a burnt yellow color with a nice haze A+
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with some orange around the middle, two finger thick head with pretty good retention. Smell is floral and earthy hops, with notes of tangerine, resin, grass, wheat, pineapple and hay."
"Appearance: pours a hazy golden color with a 2"" head. Thick lace develops."
"Very Green is better, IMO"
"Hazy opaque gold pour, huge head, huge lace. Tropical fruit aroma, quite dank, resinous. Big time hops up front, dank, catty, tropical fruit, orange, pine. Mouthfeel is spot on, light dank finish."
"From a 16oz can, dated 06/20/17... let it grow. Served in a tulip."
Canned yesterday
"This was one of those beers that I've been lucky enough to sample multiple times in the line at Other Half. Many probably consider this to be the standard for IPA's from this neck of the woods, and it's quite easy to see how! Tasty, smooth, and easy to drink, it's nearly impossible not to like this once the initial hit of the hops and citrus takes hold."
"5-9-17 canned date so this is about 10 days old. Finally getting to try this one and easy lives up to the hype. Pours bright orange and completely hazy. Nose is of fresh pineapple, papaya, & mangoes. Taste is amazingly tropical nectar juice bomb with an ever so slight malt note on the end. Mouth feel is creamy and fluffy, Simply great. Finding words pretty hard to describe this beer. So flavorful and complex for an IPA. Yes that damn good!"
"Tree House is leading the craft beer charge... and nobody else is even close. This beer is hazy, aromatic, zesty, citrusy, dank, and oh-so drinkable. Like all their beers, it gets better as it warms, and leaves you longing for more after each sip. I find myself dragging out every TH beer for as long as possible, never wanting it to end. Amazing."
honestly a little over rated
Team Green!!
"Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can. The can is green, too. I would love to see a green batch of wort. Canned date 4/26/17. Practically dusty. "
Look: Hazy yellow with big fluffy white head. Has medium low carbonation.
"Damn, this beer is really amazing! It pours a merky hazy golden orange. The the fruity delicious smell hits you. Orange, mango, pineapple, it's all there! How can you not love Tree House beers and the hopppy goodness that they portray?! The first sip will knock your socks off! Pure juicy and delicious! Each mouthful gets better and better especially as the beer warms up. Have to say this is one of my favorite beers that I have ever had!! Every mouthful is so enjoyable! Never gets old. Do yourself a favor and take the trip to this brewery and get your hands on some of these! Arguably the best beer on the planet!"
"absolutely killer beer, murked out yellow, big fluffy head. smell and flavor are spot on to the can description, this is a galaxy bomb. feel was damn near perfect, though my preference would be a tad more fuzzy (just being picky now). new favorite one I've had from TH."
a little less drinkable than haze. Another great beer though from TH.
"4/21/17 canned on date poured into a Tree House snifter. I thought Julius was my favorite TH beer, but it is now second fiddle to Green. The aromatics and flavors of Green are so much brighter than Julius. I'm going to have to seek out more Galaxy hopped beers. Maybe I'm a Galaxy fanboy and didn't know it. The nose on this beer is so tropical and floral that I'm sure the unsuspecting would never guess they are smelling a beer. Green taste like a tropical mixed drink. I'm definitely going to seek out more of these. Team Green all the way."
Very tasty. Must try Very Green.
"Damn good, wow! Green is a truly remarkable beer. Right from the beginning of the pour the sinfully decadent aroma hit me right in the face. Going in for the sip and everything from the nose follows through with the flavor. Just a glorious hop explosion that is some of the finest nectar the world has to offer coats the palate and rides out gracefully with the malt and yeast backbone. This may overtake haze as my favorite treehouse beer and is easily the best regular American IPA I have ever had, by a wide margin."
"Pours a hazy yellow, not a lot of foam."
"From a trade, canned 3/28"
Better Than Julius just not as pretty
"Snagged Julius and Green at the brewery yesterday. Cracked Green the same day it was brewed, after 2-3 hours in the fridge to chill. Pouring it into a pint glass I immediately catch the rich aroma of hops and fruit, which is remarkably potent. Once in the glass the beer is completely opaque."
"L: classic hazy light orange hue, cloudy with a thin white head"
Look: A solid hazy orange that I cannot see through. There was only a small amount of head to it that quickly went away after a soft pour.
Pours a very hazy muddled orange color. The orange is quite bright and almost glows in the light. Thin off white head dissipates quickly leaving plenty of white lacing and some spotty residual head. 
Stoked to finally try Treehouse. This gem was canned 10 days ago.
Unbelievable beer. Haven't had the pleasure of trying all their beers but this and Julius are unbelievable.
Very Smooth and Tastes Great
Picked up cans at the brewery and poured into Tree House tulip. Extremely hazy. Aroma and taste are pineapple. Smooth but flavorful.
"Acquired in a trade, about two weeks old."
"Waited forever at the brewery to fill a few growlers of this beer. Wasn't disappointed. Juicy, with a velvety mouthful. Hazey almost orange color. Definitely worth the over 90 minute wait to fill my growler."
"I got ahold of a couple of these from a friend who got them on a very recent trade and they were absolutely terrible. He said the same thing about the two he had...There was something wrong with the beer and I love this style- juicy style IPA. The beer was so flawed I dumped both after a couple of sips. It literally tasted worse than my worst homebrews so there must have been a one off issue with this batch. No legible date stamp on the cans except for a 17'. Hopefully I get to try this one again as it clearly is a great beer, just not the case with the batch I had though."
"L: cloudy, hazy yellow, lacing thin head"
Pours a hazy golden amber with a one and a half finger frothy head that reduces to a halo and thin film of bubbles. Perfect lacing.
Poured to a tulip glass.
"2 week old can. Hazy orange mud water. Looks cloudy and quite unappealing. Smells like dank and citrus. Taste follows. Some dominant citrus notes and a light bready backbone. Nothing exceptional. All hype...not a bad beer, but nothing like the stuff coming out of HF and Trillium taste-wise."
Good lord the juiciness on this bad boy. 
"3.5 month old can. Opaque peach color with off-white head. Aroma is quite subdued, just some generic hops. Taste starts fruity with a hint of peach sweetness but gets quickly bitter and resiny. Medium plus body, nice carbonation. Overall it's still really good but I think it's already past its prime."
"More fruit in the nose than Julius, creamy in the mouth. Lovely!"
Classic look haze yellow gold color. Pineapple more than orange on the nose with familiar treehouse backbone. Taste is great citrus upfront with great hoppy flavor throughout. Feel is full and round what you want in this style. Uncertain why other's don't emulate this? Not the best beer I have ever had but close to it. I would say I would get it again but that is a whole other story. Hopefully with their expansion availability becomes less of an issue.
Great beer.
This beer is perfect! Immediate pinneapple and kiwi aroma. Tastes like a hop-bomb went off in your mouth. Great feel and has a healthy bite on it! Do whatever you can do to trade for this beer!
Canned 2/7/17... so fresh!
A: pours a thick milky looking straw yellow
In a word. Perfection
Lovely hazy pour with a nice fluffy head that fades fairly quickly
16 oz can from 1-4-17 poured into a snifter
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Perfect balance of hops and citrus. If you can get your hands on some, drink it."
"Absolutely brilliant. As of this review, the best beer I have tasted. The smoothness of Green and the juice-like drinkability of it has redefined the potential of what an IPA is to me. Green is the first Treehouse beer I've had that's apart of the core lineup, and I look forward to trying the rest after this masterpiece."
I have spent a lot of green on Green in the past few weeks. Very enjoyable beer!
A: cloudy; deep gold in color 1+ finger off white head that receded to a thin cap; very nice lacing;
"For me, Treehouse is the gold standard for that NE haze. This one is full of citrus juice and finishes with a nice floral hop character. Color is just like orange juice."
Another amazing IPA from Treehouse.
poured from 16 oz glass into Veil House Glass. Canned on 11-21-2016. 
"L: Pale yellow, orange colored beer. Opaque, turbid. Head dissapates rather quickly, except for a bubbly froth around the glass. Head can be coaxed by swirling"
"Canned 11-18-15. Drank 12-04-15. Sharp citrus & tropicals in the nose. Spicy rind, melon, pineapple drink."
Amazing
"I believe I liked Julious better but it's strictly a preferred aroma/taste for me. Pour was beautiful, juicy, hazy, mouthfeel can only be rivaled by other TH offerings."
"Green draws long lines for its IPA rep. It's subtler than other IPA's, less hoppy than expected. Pours into the lightest haze of the Tree House beers I've had. Smell is crispy hop with fruity hints. Tastes less bitter than expected and more juicy, like a subtler version of the fruitier TH brews. The hop backbone is a bit more obvious though, with the hop-volume turned up a bit. Feel is thinner on the palette – so I have to chase the flavors a bit more as they dart between subtle orange to spruce gum. Like other TH offerings, it's smoother drinking than you'd expect. A terrific beer."
"May be the best beer I've ever tasted. Tangerine, pine, pineapple, and the exact right amount of bitter. I drank with some pine salt dusted french fries and herbed chicken, and this is perfect for food. I can't stress enough - YOU MUST TRY THIS BEER!"
"This is a bit more piny and less citrusy than its sibling Julius. Sweet pine up front, quickly transitions into tropic fruit, primarily mango, and a sweet maltiness. Medium body and a tropical fruit/citrus aftertaste with some pine resin. Really pleased with this one. Flavors are so well balanced that it is easy to detect each without one overpowering and masking the others. Truly a pleasure."
Thanks Kegatron for the hookup. Pounder can into a tulip appears muddy like a melted orange creamsicle with a finger of white cap resting atop that fades leaving patchy lace.
"I know this is going to sound cliche, but I want to drink this in a tree house...preferably with Dale and Brennan."
Dank smell. Good color. Nice flavor.
So mind blowing. There are so many flavors and tastes. Its crazy. Worth the drive. Get this beer if you can
"First had 9/19/16 at home courtesy of Nate S. It's super juicy and bitter, mostly everything you could ever want in an IPA. Only got my hands on a few cans, but enjoyed every sip."
"Pours a pale yellow color with some haze to it. Fluffy head leaves plenty of lace. Aroma of dank, tropical fruits, and perhaps some citrus. The flavor has mango, papaya, and pineapple flavors. Really bright tropical notes and plenty of bitterness backing it up. Super drinkable and smooth on the palate. Really a very nice beer."
Tree House Green
"This has been a whale beer for me so I'm super excited to review. Canned 11/17. Drank out of a Tulip. This beer looks just about perfect. Super, super hazy medium gold/yellow with tight compact head. The aroma reminds me of Julius with awesome orange candy flavors. Overall aroma is super tropical, lots of Pineapple. Flavor translates over to the palate really well but with a strong citrus pith bitterness. Mouthfeel is dead on perfect. This beer was super hyped for me and I'm happy to say that it meets those expectations...but it's not better than Julius. 98.5 points!"
"what can I say that hasn't already been said. This gets 5's across the board from me. Very tropical grapefruit, mango, pineapple while still being a beer. very drinkable. My wife hates beer and said that this doesn't smell like a beer to her. I've had a few treehouse beers and this is my favorite so far."
Desert Island beer for this guy.
L: very cloudy pale orange color with a finger of off white foam that fades fast
"To me this is the perfect beer, look, smell, taste, and feel."
Couldn't wait any longer to try this one.
"Pours merky orange with a nice head. Nice lacing. Aroma cotrusand pineapple. Taste follows the nose with pine needles,citrus with earthy tone finish. Another great one from tree house."
"Canned 10/27/16 with ""Cubs or Indians"" on the bottom; pours very cloudy yellow gold color with a 1 finger cloudy white head that faded slowly and left really good lacing. Looks like a glass of grapefruit juice."
Currently drinking out of a snifter. Poured from a can dated 10/27/16 -- exactly 21 days ago. 
"Pours a turbid orange, murky with one finger of whipped cream white head, lace is solid. Smell is massive fruit, tropical, orange and pineapple, juicy citrus hops. Taste is orange and pineapple, mango, citrus fruit, massive hop flavour, just juicy fruit, bitterness is low, tangerine in the aftertaste but straight up fruit juice. Light carb, creamy med full body. Outstanding stuff , worth the hype for sure."
"wow everything I was waiting for, yellow yellow grapefruit color murky and cloudy, smell the grapefruit citrus and tangy, taste was incredible, lot's of grapefruit and citrus, feel had the proper carbonation and overall the is outstanding. To me this is the best TH, a beer that transcends the style and stands alone!"
Will rate again- weakest of the TH I've had- chalk it up to a bad batch or tough competition- had Swish right before and Melcher St right after- but honestly didn't hold up well to the other top IPAs I've had recently.
Pours like OJ (typical). Almost 0% transparency. Beautiful golden hue.
Bit disappointed compared to the other beers I've had from them.
"This is the muckiest and murkiest beer I have ever seen. No filtration whatsoever, and I think they added in some more particles to it cause there was a large mud slick at the bottom of the can. Regardless, the beer is very good, but I am not huge on this one due to it's being a bit off the beaten path for me. But, I suggest you try one as it is a thoroughly enjoyable experience as I will in the future."
"Pours golden and hazy with a yellowish, soapy head. Strong smell of citrus and tropical fruits. At first the taste is mostly citrus, but mango and pineapple notes start appearing on the front followed by a bitter, orange/lemon peel on the back. Leaves a bready, biscuit flavor on your breath. Pretty carbonated, not too wet, lighter mouthfeel."
"Hazy yellow in the glass. Smell is a pineapple bomb up front. Hop resin, orange, and generalized citrus character is present as well. Definitely juicy. Taste is sweet and citrusy up front with a dry bitter on the back end. Classic NE IPA but just a touch too bitter for my own taste (not overtly so however). Feel is kind of thick for the style as the haziness is an indication of the particulate floating around. Excellent beer overall that is a touch too bitter for my own tastes but most would not find anything objectionable about it. Treehouse for the win; again."
By Zeus' beard!
"Appearance - Poured from a growler, a very light but hazy straw color. Perfect juicy color."
"A nuclear blast of fresh cut pineapples, sweet tangerines, and the fabled tropical fruit cocktail of papaya, guava, and mango dominate the nose upon first whiff. Behind the initial bells-and-whistles lay a solid foundation of bitter grapefruit peels, and sure enough, the ""orange sherbet."" Tree House's signature yeast combination of white pepper, earthy spice, and grass surface toward the back as the brew warms up. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀"
"Maybe like this one as much or more than Julius, really love it. Like everything about it, the pour, head, smell, length of the finish, body & mouth feel, carbonation level, did I say how the flavor stays in your mouth after you swallow? Love it."
L: Golden yellow haze. Large white head with nice retention. Beautiful
I had green a few times. My last time was about a week ago. After having this again I am sure this is my favorite Treehouse beer. I love the flavor and I do prefer it over Julius.
From can dated 9-29. One of the nicest smelling beers I have sampled. Looks and taste remind me of fresh grapefruit juice. The initial taste is nice and fruity up front with a bitterish finish. As my taste buds adjust to the hops i can appreciate the nice creamy / smooth texture.
"Okay, now this is a tasty IPA but a bit odd as it's got a lot tropical notes but they pair better with the hops than the Julius does. This was kegged on September, 27, 2016."
"Bought some cans from Tree House on 9/29. The beer pours with a murky dark yellow appearance, thick lacing on the sides, and a long lasting bubbly head. Aromas include some sharp hop spice mixed with a nice balance of tangerine and grapefruit. Taste is bitter with piney citrus hops mixed with fruits like the grapefruit from the nose. Carbonation was decent with this drink, but its heavy flavors were made approachable thanks to the medium body of the beer. Overall, excellent appearance with great characteristics overall."
"Tasty and hoppy. Great tasting beer, just like all the others that Treehouse makes. Will not disappoint."
Canned 9/19/16. Consumed 9/25. I found this one to be a bit raw and vegetal shortly after canning.
Poured into my Tree House goblet.
I wanted to try this beer before reading any reviews about it. Finally last weekend I managed to go to Treehouse Brewery and get the 'Green'. 
I am a huge fan of Tree House.
AMAZING! This beer is tied with Julius as the best beers I have ever had! Get your hands on it ASAP!
Originally from the west coast. The NE juice bombs are really growing on me. Probably the best beer I have ever had
"Poured into Tree House snifter. Hazy gold with one inch off white bubbly, foamy head that slowly dissipates to a nice ring and thin cap."
"Great IPA. Review below mine is almost my exact thoughts. Strong alcohol content but doesn't taste it, and one of the least bitter IPAs I've had. I'm not going to pretend like I can taste every note or flavor, but it's fruity, and smooth. I let someone who's doesn't typically like IPAs try it, and they loved it. Another great Treehouse beer. I don't think it's quite as good as their Julius, but it's pretty damn close."
Excellent citrus flavored IPA with notes of pineapple noticeable. it is a gem.
"It is an exceptionnal IPA. The only one I've tasted that came close to this was from Maine Brewing Co. Green is a fresh, very fruity yet complex beer. Very balanced, I'm not gonna bother detailing all the aromas, it's just amazing, that's all you need to know. I had doubts about the hype surrounding Tree House, no more though. I disagree that this is a hophead beer, this beer isn't very bitter nor is it challenging. Everyone should be able to enjoy it, you don't feel the 7.6% ABV at all."
Poured from 2L growler filled on 9/2 into a Gabriel Glas Gold stem.
"I've had most of TH's lineup. Including a few of the rare ipas. Green may very well be my favorite. IMO it may be the most balance ipa that they put out. Its malty yet crushable. Seriously, this is the beer that I tend to get carried away with. Its very juicy, I get the pineapple juice comparison like crazy. It also has a very nice hoppy aftertaste. It is a little dank and I love it. I can almost find julius and alter to be a little thin. Green really skirts the line between an ipa and a double. Like all tree house ipas the smell is obviously great. If anything this is one of the better ones. It'll lace a glass like no other. If I could get only one tree house brew regularly, this would probably have to be the one. Its just so well balanced and always scratches the itch no matter what mood I'm in."
Can from Reagan1984 via northyorksammy. Thanks guys! Served in my Indie tasting snifter at work. Canned 8/19/2016.
"Pours incredibly murky, nose is incredible, big mouthful."
Canned 8/31/16
Can dated 07/12/16.
1 PINT can
Thank you cosmicevan! Amazing introduction to treehouse.
I would rate it a hair below Julius but this is a joy to drink.
"Hazy fruit bomb! Small tan head, so much tropical fruit, pineapple, mango."
From can into chalice.
"Thanks to my dude A.B. for bringing this back from Mass! Looks like a milkshake, super cloudy. I think it looks cool. Smell: Whoa! It smells like you're opening up a can of dole cut pineapples. Nice hop aromas around the edges of the fruit-splosion. Just smells super fruity. Crazy. Taste is a really nice mix of pineapple, papaya, nice very slightly sweet malt, enriching and balanced hops. Feel is very nice, rich, smooth, perfect carbonation. Overall: A must-have!"
"Pours like turbid grapefruit juice with a dense foamy head. As the beer is consumed the head leaves bands of sticky lacing. There is a lot of pineapple and other citrus fruits in the nose. Perhaps a bit of melon and some pine as well. The taste is pineapple, a bit of sweetness and a spectacular bitter hop finish. This beer is medium bodied and creamy. This is a truly balanced and delicious beer with a great mouthfeel."
Very juicy in the nose but less in taste. A stronger hop presence than in other Treehouse offerings. It strikes a great balance. Delicious.
"Smell is mango, pineapple, a hint of passionfruit, and a hint of tangerine. Taste was heavy pineapple juice, mango, juicy citrus, and a nice hop bitterness. Liked this one better than Julius."
"Another excellent beer from Monson. Heavy melon notes, pineapple, less citrus. Awesome mouthfeel. This one had eluded me for a while, but got a fresh 750 bottled this past week that I was more than happy to share."
Sampled Green a while back and obviously loved it. Just picked it up on my run yesterday and had my 1st full can....amazing! Even better than I remembered. Maybe my favorite Treehouse offering!
"Canned last week, poured into a tree house tulip. "
Smooth citrus blend. Worth the wait in line for only a few. They were not shared. Maybe next time my friends.
"Looks like all their other beers: cloudy and yellow-orange. It smells great, but tastes unbalanced. I thought it was too cold, so let it warm a bit. No, still out of balance. Mouthfeel is like their other beers too: thick and the flavor lingers. Overall, not their best beer."
"can from 7/12...just a few days ago. have been fortunate enough to have this a few times, but always psyched to get the chance. probably my favorite treehouse? just super juicy...great bidy, just killer."
"Appearance is pulpy OJ with a large, foamy, bulbously lopsided eggshell colored head that leaves thin, sporadic lace."
"Received a Green 16 oz pounder in a trade along with some other great beers from Tree House and Trillium. Did comparison with Green, Alter Ego, Bright w/ Nelson and Artaic. Green won. Pours a beautiful hazy golden with orange hint and fruity aroma and flavor. Delicious!"
My dad showed up today. He's on a modified car circuit race team. Travels around New England. He brought me this little gem. 16oz.can with a coozy!!.
"UPDATED REVIEW: Canned 7/12, consumed 7/17."
Another insane beer from the best. Pours a rich yellow cloud and pineapple on the nose. The first sip is the sweet pineapple with a hint of orange. Next the orange blend into a tangerine and the barely carbonated body just sits on your tongue. Like drinking a sweet orange juice. Finish stays strong and beautiful. You have no idea you're drinking almost 8%. Definitely top 20 all time brews.
"16oz can, stamped 06.29.2016, poured into a Treehouse Teku glass."
Creamy finish. Love the hop character.
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with one inch head. Taste is lime, orange rind, and pineapple. Flavors are more subtle than the other Tree House brews I have had. Medium bodied, slightly bitter, and juicy. Heads and tails above most beers I have had, but behind Julius and Haze in my Tree House order. Worth seeking out and an amazing IPA. Really beginning to realize in my world, IPAs are like rauchbiers. There is one brewery that is heads and tails above the others and Tree House is in a class by itself."
"Treehouse is a very hyped up brewery and since they're only 45 minutes away, I mad it a point to check out some of their brews. Green was recommended to me I think galaxy hops are the stuff of legends when brewed right. I heard green was one of the best beers Treehouse makes, and that leaves me a little worried. It a good beer no doubt, but its not what its cracked up to be. I taste lots of peaches and a general IPA kind of taste. Overall, its a good beer, but not worth the hype."
Green with envy
"Can dated June 15, obtained in MBC dinner line beer trade. Thanks George RR Martin looking guy! (that's a compliment of course) Shared and poured into ale glass."
"I've been lucky enough to have a few other tree house beers, and in my opinion, this one was my least favorite. It starts off impressive enough with great tropical fruit smells, but the bitterness actually takes over my taste buds, giving it a rather unpleasant finish."
"This beer pours a very cloudy dark golden orange, very murky The head is big, fluffy and creamy white. Retention is excellent and there are sticky, hanging rings of lacing all over the glass. Smell is pineapple, tangerine, mango and citrus pith. Taste is similar with a moderately bitter finish. Feel is medium and so so soft. Legit almost delicate, until the bitter slightly resinous finish. Overall another world class beer by Treehouse. I have it ranked slightly below the other offerings I've had from them, but it is still spectacular."
"16oz can: 6/15/16 ""HERE COMES DAT BOI"" "
"Poured from a can aged six days. Cloudy orange color with white head. Tropical fruit smell. Tastes of mango, orange. Starts sweet and finishes with mild bitter. Great IPA, less sweet and more bitter taste than Julius, a great alternative. Great mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation. This is a great beer with typical tree house flavor."
"Look: very hazy, kinda reminds me of pulp free orange juice. About half an inch of head "
Great TH mouthfeel. Pineapple and citrus on the palate. Really solid but not even close to my favorite tree house - missing the dank backbone of AE and J.
My favorite offering from Treehouse
"Murky pale yellow/orange color with an off white head a sticky lacing smells of citrus , tangerine and orange with tropical fruits , taste is superb it opens with loads of citrus tangelo, grapefruit, and orange also picked up dank garden hops finishes with a slight bitterness, mouth feel is crisp with prickly pine and citrus hops on the palate, a pleasure to drink pint just dissapeared"
Poured from 750ml bottle into teku 
"This is my very first Tree House offering, and it was absolutely amazing. I lucked out and picked up 12 of these and 12 of the Alter Ego. I am hoping that the Alter Ego is as delicious as this was. I look very forward to trying out their other brews. Luckily I am only 60 miles away; an easy shot up to Monson."
Poured from a 4/6 can (exactly one month) into a Balckback Pub snifter. Super golden hazy which I get. Good galaxy aroma. Awesome taste with grapefruit finish. Well balanced! From a DLD trade.
Serving: Can
"I have this one all the time, as I am only 30 minutes from Tree House (lucky me!). Although I am #TeamJulius, Green is not a beer to take lightly. A greater bitterness than Julius makes it a great one-two punch of flagship beers."
"Finally got my hands on my first tree house! After all these trades, finally led to Green."
"Green is another spectacular offering from Tree House, which may very well be my favorite brewery. It is turbid as usual with an impenetrably bright yellow orange hue. It smells very tropical as if you were taken to Jamaica. The taste reflects the smell with significant pineapple. There is some sizzling of the hops on the tongue at first, but then this beautifully pillow-like, super smooth creaminess takes over. It is hard to tell if I like Green or Julius more, but I think Julius has a slight edge. World Class Brew."
Great beer. Put ur hop hat on. But 2 or 3. Will do the trick
"Wow, my first sip of Treehouse lives up to all the hype. "
"3rd favorite TH beer to date, behind Haze then Very Hazy."
"Literally might be in my top five beers of all time. So delicious, so smooth, and so juicy. I could drink one of these ar any point in the year. Hell, this would quench my thirst after running a half marathon. I can't say enough about this beer!"
Had in a tulip glass from a can dated 3/15/2016.
"Pours a hazy orange in color with a finger of white head, very reminiscent of orange juice. Aroma is very tropical with lots of pineapple, some citrus, and mango. The taste is straight juice and is heavy on the tropical fruits; mango, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and peach. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel. Overall a good beer and an excellent representation of a New England style IPA but I just wasn't feeling it."
"Green is delicious, different hop flavor than I am used to. Very Potent, but definitely great, I prefer Julius a bit more, but would go for this beer any time. Each time I have it I like it more and more."
"pours light yellow, aroma of citrus, taste is also citrus with pine, more complex than I am making it seem. Feels rich, creamy, foamy. Another great New England IPA."
An impressive bubble show creates a meringue-like head layered on top of the cloudy honey colored liquid; excellent retention with plenty of lacing to boot. Smells like a combination of all the tropical fruit juices you have ever smelt.
"This beer is magical. Canned on 3/15, it produces a cloudy orange appearance with significant head and plenty of lace from start to finish. It smells like sex on a platter. Pineapple and clean sweat. Imagine making love to Elisha Cuthbert and all you can smell is her hair, and that Victoria's Secret body spray she uses, liberally. This is that smell. Fresh, over ripe and bursting with aroma. Mango lassi in beer form. The taste follows but with different layers of tropical goodness, and that tongue smacking bitterness that you expect and deserve from an IPA. Seared peach skin, orange rind, gentle coriander, grainy cracker, faint pear. All of that. The feel is Hayden Panettiere on the tongue. So smooth, so soft, so gentle. It lays on the tongue just long enough to remind you how good Tree House does what they do best - IPAs. Believe the hype; this company is the upper echelon of IPA. They never fail to disappoint. All scores warranted, all pours are the shit. Larrrrrrrrrrrge."
"Very good brew. It's definitely a lighter IPA, but mixed very well, and lives up to the Treehouse standard. I would definitely recommend as this is better than most, but not their best. I agree with the BROS' rating on this one."
"Completely unfiltered, cloudy, orange body with a thick, frothy off-white head. Aroma is big of tropical fruits and citrus; grapefruit, mango, juicy citrus. Flavor is more unfiltered hop goodness. Big and juicy with tons of tropical fruits and big juicy citrus. Feel is medium bodied, feels unfiltered, medium carbonation. Really fantastic IPA from Tree House. Really awesome."
"Really great Tree House beer here. Poured a hazy gold with excellent hop aromas. Flavor was excellent as well. Hop profiles galore, but subtle as well. Did not overwhelm any of the senses, but rather balanced them all out for a great drinking experience."
I love this beer. Depending on the batch I can swing to Julius or this but as I get older I am starting to switch to Green.
"Tons of citrus, pine and tropical fruits. Perhaps I'm insane, but this is not my favorite Tree House beer..."
Treehouse can do no wrong.
"16oz can: this one pours a hazy, opaque golden color. There was lots of head and some lacing. Good nose. Lots of citrus, pine and tropical notes. The taste is also very good. Suprisingly not overly bitter with a bit of sweetness. Tropical flavors, malts, touch of biscuit. Really Nice!"
"Tons of citrus, orange and grapefruit. Not much bitterness. Alcohol is hard to taste. Mouthfeel is about the best it can get, and overall a great beer."
"My first TH beer. I am not a fan of IPAs but these guys intrigued me as I heard they are juicy as opposed to bitter and all the acclaim and hullaballoo is well-deserved. Looks thick and hazy like apple juice/cider color. Smells like tropical, citrus juice and mango nectar. Thick silty mouthfeel. I taste pineapple juice and lemon-lime Gatorade with additional citrus notes and some wheat. None of that west coast Cali bitterness that attacks the throat which is why I do not care for IPAs. This beer opened my eyes to the world of the Juicy East Coast IPA. A JPA - Juice Pale Ale. Excellent beer!"
"not fond of ultra-cloudy brews but this one, like the Trilliums, is different..... super aromatic and super juicy and flavorful.... without letting the superstar status affect me, this is a VERY good brew...."
"Poured a hazy orange grapefruit juice color. with a 2 finger head that lasted for a wile that turned into a nice lace. This beer can not be seen through at all. its so thick and pulpy looks just like grapefruit juice.the aroma is out of this world one of the best aromas on a beer I have ever smelled. So much going on I picked up,tropical orange juice,grape fruit juice,rainbow sherbet,a little green onion grassy flavor.the aroma is AMAZING!!!!!!"
"This might be the best beer I ever had. Juicy, well-balanced, great aroma."
"Well hello there you green beautiful bastard. Like your orange friend, you make me quite happy. I made a trade a while back that included either you or Dr. J and I feel I would be lost without either of you. Green is a dank, delicious, juicy, treat, that packs just a little bit more punch than Julius, but also drinks like something you could have in the morning with your bacon and eggs."
"Poured from the 16oz can dated 02/16/16 into a snifter glass last night, 5 days old. Comes out this beautiful hazy bright gold with some orange hues, nice off white head leaves lacing."
Thanks to knicks19947 for the chance.
"As close to the great new england style hazy hop explosion that has been created. I crave and dream of this beer. pillowy goodness of citrus, tangerine, creamsicle, oh god."
"Purchased on 17Feb 2016 and imbibed 18Feb2016. Poured from can to Duvel tulip. This was a must visit as it was only 45min out of the way from my trip from Milford, CT to Winooski, VT for Heady Topper. "
Green is the perfect beer. Waited in line on a Wednesday at the brewery and after making a few line friends I finally made it in. The limit was 6 and I bought them up. Some people were even bringing their non beer drinking friends with them so they could get more...it's that good.
Amazing!!!
"OMG. Lives up to the hype, there is absolutely nothing I would change with this beer. IMHO, slightly edges out Heady Topper, but I may be biased to it's closer location to me."
"I just had my first Julius and Green today. The former was canned 2/3 and the latter 2/2. Like Julius, the body has an opaque haze. This beer has a more pined edge to it than Julius, and the body might be slightly less plush, and the sweetness slightly more crisp. I preferred Green by a slight bit."
"Wouldn't change a thing about this beer...such a complete american IPA...perfect cloudy light NE style IPA...smell is orange, pineapple and bubblegum for days...taste is more of the same with a heavy orange/tangerine component...mouthfeel is so chewy...such a crushable beer...a work of art"
Just really a perfect beer. Great hazy orange color and smooth silky mouthfeel. Huge tropical and citrus notes. It has fresh herb (basil?) character that really makes it stand out. Taste follows pretty much identical to the nose. Perfect in every way.
"Somehow each batch gets better and better. Used to prefer Julius to Green, but no longer. So creamy, balanced bitterness, juicy, typical perfect TH mouthfeel."
"Pourd from can into can style glass. Color is a bit lighter than alter ego with thick head.smell is mostly pine and pineapple for me. Taste is mostly nectarine and pineapple. Carbonation is a little strong but without it, itd be syrup. Overall great ipa, not as crushable as alter ego or julius, but does make me want to find a cabin in the woods."
"Another beauty from Tree House. Not a true citrus bomb, but citrusy with a little piney dryness. Excellent."
A: Hazy yellow with a finger of head thick lacing
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"Super solid IPA, drank it right after a Julius and I think that hurts the review. More dank than citrus, and I prefer my ipas juicy. Treehouse does not disappoint"
Big fan of everything Tree House
Canned three days prior to tasting.
Absolutely incredible beer.
first review ever. pours nice hazy light green. doing side by side w very green. smell of tropical notes maybe mango. papaya. mouthfeel is creamy w mid to late palate bitterness and tropical fruit. overalll this is one of my favorite beers. remarkable improvement as the beer warms. so much juicy mango and pineapple. although very green turns this gem up a notch its only s small notch cause this is awsome. very creamy and bursting w flavor.
"Pours a hazy orange with white head. Some light aroma of orange, citrus rind, and may be a little papaya. It's not as aromatic as I expected it to be. Flavor is wonderful. Little to no bitterness. It has that Treehouse papaya-y malt base, but fortunately, the Australian hops provide a nice contrast. I really like the mouthfeel. It is chewy, gummy. I think it plays better in this beer than a Julius, if I am picking up a similar malt bill/flavor."
Juice Bomb !
Appearance: An impressive bubble show creates a meringue-like head layered on top of the cloudy honey colored liquid; excellent retention with plenty of lacing to boot
My Favorite beer. 
"This is exactly what I was hoping for. Super juicy beer packed with aromas of orange sherbet, tropical fruit juice and dankness."
My favorite go to treehouse brew
More of an orange flavored ipa compared to all of the grapefruity ones. Good ipa. Definitely had to try it
Don't drink Julius. Drink Green.
"Recently tasted a few BA Scored 100 IPA's after a couple trades and this is the winner for me of the bunch. The look of this beer is not that great, kind of a murky brownish/orange-ish liquid with a nice white head that leaves a ton of lacing. The smell is very good for an IPA. Nothing outstanding but you can tell from the nose you are about to drink an IPA. The flavor is outstanding! great orange sherbet, pineapple, orange juice bomb with a slight bitterness. the mouthfeel is very good as the beer is a little light on carbonation. Definitely feel that light carb adds to the flavor profile."
16oz can dated 1/5/16 poured into Teku glass on 1/14/16. 
"Pours a super hazy opaque orange yellow. Smell is super juicy hops with a powerful mixture of citrus fruit, and a touch of melon. Mouthfeel is impressively full while drinking juicy and smooth."
"Absolutely incredible beer. I've only had Haze and Green from TH, but I have to say that this is one of the best beers I've ever had. Certainly the best IPA."
Canned on 12-1-15 and poured into my Goose Island nonic pint.
Poured from a 16oz can.
"Had the 12/22/15 batches of Julius, Haze, Green this Xmas break. WOW! Julius edged both a bit. Haze and Green on the same level IMO. Thick and juicy. Great head. Balanced. Amazing beer!"
"Poured a cloudy golden color, not much to look at but who cares. Its just so damn tasty. Tree House makes some stellar brews and this is right up there with their best. Nice aroma and fruity - juicy flavor. Super smooth and easy to drink. I could slam these all day if they were easier to get. Fantastic beer. Cheers"
Canned 1/5/16 poured into a teku. 
"Picked up a growler of this from the brewery. Fantastic beer. I could drink it all day long. In fact - I did! Awesome hop profile: lots of piney, dank, fresh flavors. Tree House has really been killing it lately and this is no exception."
"Pours a completely clouded grapefruit juice color with a big, spongy head. Actually, this beer looks pretty neat in its own, headstrong, dirty way."
"Probably the ugliest IPA I have seen in a while. Murky orangish, greenish, brown with a dense white head. Aroma is intense hop presence of tangerines, lemons, and pale malts. Really impressive smell. Flavor starts of as strait fruit juice come at you in waves of orange rind, grapefruit, and some dank, grassy flavors. The finish though is somewhat off for me. Some astringency is there or possibly even some burnt notes that comes in about 10 sec after each sip. Body is creamy for the style, but I can dig it. "
"16oz can, from the brewery. "
"After having tried Alter Ego I decided to give this a shot. Price was high but not much different from other stuff brought down to NY from VT. Perhaps my palate was already weary by thw time I tried it, but I didnt get all the notes everyone seems to be talking about. Def above average beer, but 100, not to me it wasn't. I'd give it a 90."
"What can I say. This beer is the real deal. I am fortunate enough to have had the best east coast IPAs ( Heady, Focal, Sunshine, Session 2, G Bot, Lunch) and this is my absolute favorite. It was fairly easy to get as well. I drove to the brewery this evening, they where open 12 to 6 for cans only. I arrived at 5:15 and had a line of about 15 or so. Very well organized, moved quickly. 8 can limit on Julius and Green, so I grabbed the max. $60 for 16 is a steal for this quality. Color is freaky awesome orange haze, nice thick white head. Smell is super pineapple and citrus smell. Taste is even more intense if pineapple and citrus. Nice sweet malty taste, a thick and rich finish. Each taste gets better. Thank you Tree House! Amazing beer. You have another loyal customer!"
This beer is off the charts amazing. Slight changes have been made since I first had it last October. Another awesome juice bomb from tree house.
"This is really TH meets west coast style IPA. The nose was way piney and resinous. Super Dank, super hoppy, pretty bitter and creamy mouth feel. I'm slightly biased because I'm not the biggest fan of the bitter finishing IPAs but a very good beer."
Poured a fresh can into a tulip glass.
"Look - a nice rich, bright orange-y color, with a medium head that lasts a little bit longer than most. The lacing seems to be everlasting."
Just a great beer. Those NE hops are the real deal. This pours a super hazy golden color and the nose is absolutely incredible. This drinks super juicy with very little bitterness.
Pours a very turbid honey golden orange color with two fingers of an off-white head. Looks like grapefruit juice. One of the best looking beers I've seen.
"Green delivers in every way possible, It's beers like this that are making beers like heady less relevant...."
16oz. can into a Grrrz teku. 
"Big tropical flavors against a light colored, hazy body. The malt flavor is light and almost non-existent, allowing the hop character to really shine. Feel is great for the style."
"Received this can as part of a trade thanks to BA MVB1121. I've had Green once before, but it was about a year ago and I didn't take any notes, so I was happy to get another shot. Enjoyed on 12/19/15 out of a 16 oz tallboy that I'm pretty sure was canned on 11/26, if memory serves. Poured into a IPA-friendly Speigelau glass."
Week-old can into a Gandhi-Bot tulip. Thanks Matt!
"Beautiful, true, new England IPA. Grassy, oh so juicy. World-class."
A wonderful IPA.
Typical beautiful hazy Tree House appearance with fruit under tones but also with a pine taste which separates this one from Julius/KJ and some other TH beers. A very solid staple TH beer. Overall terrific.
Pours a very hazy golden color with medium head. Can taste the tangerine and orange notes clearly. Extremely drinkable. Scored this one in a trade. Perfect Christmas beer!
"For me, this blew Julius away and really sold me on Tree House. Great hazy, glowing yellow orange appearance. Nose is tropical fruits with a bit of pine. The taste that follows is just incredible. Juice tropical fruit, pineapple, and orange, followed by a bit of piney dankness and just the right amount of bitterness on the finish. And the creamy feel is just perfect for me. Will definitely seek this out again."
I don't have any new information to contribute to this beer. Green tastes like every tropical and citrus fruit imaginable blended into a magnificent sorbet and garnished with dank. It's pretty difficult to beat.
"Appearance- Pale orange in color, dense haze, tons of lacing, and a three finger tall fluffy/pillowy head."
Just a little dank and full of Galaxy hops. An incredible IPA.
"Hazy orange color. Tasted like orange, grapefruit, a little dank. So perfect."
Excellent Top Tier Beer. All categories are well above average and going into the excellent side.
"This was a treat all around. Juicy, tropical nose. Thick like a smoothie in the glass. Flavor just explodes with orange, mango and other tropical fruit notes. No question, this is one of the best IPAs I've had."
Complete opposite of Julius. Hazy orange color.
Poured out of a 16oz can into tulip. 
"What a phenomenal beer! First it was Julius, Haze, Alter Ego.. then this. Pours beautiful hazy gold with a nice solid white head. Tropic fruit with prominent mango at the nose with perhaps some light honey, dank grass, and lemon zest in the backdrop. Amazingly balanced. The flavors bang out juicy citrus which I love to discover in any IPA or DIPAs - pineapple, mango, grapefruit, the whole shebang along with some mild bitterness. Additionally, there was that surprise caramel element to it. Very clean beer here and medium to thick mouthfeel which is amazing for the style. Just to show that there is more to the beer industry than Heady or others that just drive us mad into the hype sucking marketing machine. Beautiful beer and one I will definitely seek any day and any time."
Pours a super cloudy almost pineapple juice. Aroma is super juicy citrus. Flavor is citrus with a bit of pine. This is a super juicy IPA. Has a slightly bitter citrus peel aftertaste but really smooth and pleasant. Overall this is an incredible IPA.
"Rating it above Alter Ego, but below Julius. Green is another fantastically bright IPA from Tree House. I'm starting to see why people wait for hours in the freezing cold for their beers. Super juicy with plenty of pineapple up front and joy in the back. Cheers!"
"can picked up today. I opened and poured into a tree house tulip. The first thing that hits is a juicy smell, but when I'm done filling the glass there's an amazing sticky dankness that frankly made me start salivating. There's a cannabis (the good stuff) scent as well. Color is hazy light orange/maple wood color, nice head but not overwhelming. taste is mango papaya goodness with a creamy mouthfeel and piney bitter goodness in the aftertaste. I feel the beer's finish working through my palate, and adding a tingly weed-like awesomeness to my sinuses while my tongue has a luscious coating of green goodness picking up sweet sticky flavors on the finish. It's pretty damn complex and delicious. Wow."
Holy. Woah. Wow. Unbelievable galaxy flavor being brought on in this beer. Done so well. Everything an IPA should be. I now understand the treehouse hype. Will be trading for more of their beers very soon.
Picked up today at the brewery. First Tree House brew for me.
"I would buy this, store this, seek this beer out! what a fantastic beer from these guys. Drinkable, hoppy, just flat out amazing with no weird aftertaste. Top ten all time beer for me thus far."
"Poured from a can into a teku. Galaxy hops really shine through on this one. Dank mangoes, pineapples and a hint of bitterness on the back-end with the classic Tree House creamy mouthfeel...worth searching out!"
Canned 11-24-15
"Can. Pours a bright orange color. Peach juice balanced on top of a flashlight. Very illuminated. Aroma is of dozens of different, sweet, mashed fruits. Tropical hop explosion. Wow, this smells nice. Exotic hoppiness. Flavor is exceptional as well. Galaxy hops? Passion fruit, pineapple, nectarine. Mossy hops. Very sweet hops. Lots to talk about. You name a descriptor for hops, you can likely find it here. Not bracingly bitter. Feel is very creamy and agreeable. I'm not sure Green is the best name for this. I expected a piney, grassy, bitter beer. Nope, just another Tree House juice brew. Nice!"
Best IPA out there.
"Great nose, a little bit too much of a malt bomb for this style for me."
First perfect score I've ever given an IPA. I just think it's absolutely flawless from the time you pop it open until the very last drop.
"Last of the Treehouse beers I received via trade. Another very good brew. This pours a cloudy light orange color. Aroma of citrus fruits and pine. Taste mostly follows, but a little more bitter than expected."
Super cloudy tangerine flesh color. Beautiful lacing.
"what an incredible beer! i never really understood the whole orange juice ipa thing till i tasted this one. looks like a glass of orange juice and has that beautiful fruity citrusy aroma. taste is the same and really just keeps washing over the pallette with waves of hoppiness, but in such a sweet smooth way."
Still my favorite Tree House beer!
"Another great beer from Tree House.. I'm in the process of finishing off a growler filled fresh last night. It's so good I couldn't wait to share it with my daughter.. Her reaction was ""oh wow.. that's great"". Love that kid."
This is a truly memorable beer. Aromas of dank pine and Cantaloupe. Growlers are not subtle but really finishes clean and smooth.
"Poured 12/1/15 from a 750ml growler that was filled at the brewery on 11/27/15, into an imperial pint glass."
Definition of what an American IPA should be. Ten out of ten in my opinion Nate does no wrong.
This beer is crazy good. The color is like orange juice. The flavors meld together like a 1000 degree kiln. 
"L: this looks like a pulpy grapefruit juice, about 1/3 ruby red and 2/3 white. Held up to the light, this is a divine kiss of inspiration, and I immediately started reciting poetic verse, backwards. I also inexplicably started doing jumping jacks. "
"Canned 18 Nov, received in trade with psweendogg. Thanks, Patrick!"
Can. Thanks Darrell! Happy Thanksgiving. 
"by fare one of if not my favorite from the treehouse brewing company. this beer has a very similar base as Julius and Alter Ego but with a more piney and less citrusy taste, in a a great way. the mouthfeel is out of this world and has a creamy and full bodied taste. absolutely one of the best brews made by treehouse."
"Daaaaaamn. This is good. Pours an opaque peach orange color. The nose is noticeable once I cracked the can! So fruity with pineapple, oranges, mango and stone fruit! This is what air fresheners need to be! The body is extremely juicy and drinkable. Could go through can after can of this stuff. There is a restrained bitterness in the finish that balances the beer out perfectly. Perfection."
Growler into pint glass.
Look - Looks like mango/pineapple juice in the glass. That killer signature TH look. Haze for days!
"Just a fabulous beer. Citrus, po e, very balanced. Wish I lived closer and could get it more often."
"A less citrusy and more piney IPA than say, Julius. You can tell it has a bit more booze but it's not harsh in any way. Another superior beer from Tree House. I personally have to put this behind Haze and Julius but it's no slouch. I want more."
"This is the second best beer I've ever had, it is absolutely amazing. Some people who had it with me were not as impressed, to each their own I suppose but it's my favorite IPA I've had narrowly beating triple sunshine"
Had my third Green today. Decided to give quick review. Great beer. Cloudy yellow-orange color. Poured into a pint glass because I'm a simple man. Grapefruit flavor that morphs into a slightly sweet cream flavor followed quickly by a hoppy finish. Then the cycle starts over again.
"Thick, murky, dank, juicy, tropical, bitter, creamy, herbal. All these characteristics combine to create something world class. But somehow it's not too fruity, bitter, cloying or heavy. It looks, tastes and smells like a beer second only to its other-worldly brother Julius. Like blending an entire field of mango and papaya trees, leaves and all, and pouring it into your glass. Unreal."
Consumed 11/18/15
"Canned 11/18, consumed 11/18. It's not often an IPA like this lives up to expectations, but this one exceeded my expectations. I've been chasing this for some time after having Julius for the first time earlier this year, and I think it's better than Julius, so juicy and dank, looks like a double dry hopped beer, and drinks so smooth. Worth seeking out."
My fave of their IPAs thus far.
"Canned Oct 28th 2015, opened Nov 14th 2015"
"It's actually happened. I'm part of #teamgreen. It's absurd how good one hoppy beer can be. Pineapple, oranges, juicy fruit, super creamy mouthfeel. Beautiful hazy orange color. There's no getting better. Choo choo. All aboard the hype train!"
A: Pours a ridiculously hazy pale golden color with a one finger bone white head. Tons of lace pasted on the glass with each sip. 
Poured from 2 liter growler bottled on 11/5/2015
L - Orange frappe. Thick and unfiltered. Two fingers of white head.
"Poured from a 7 day old 750ml swing top bottled at 7.5% ABV. One of the most remarkable aromatic experiences I've ever had with any beer, not just IPAs. Tree House seems to have made a deal with the devil in order to hit one home run after another. The sweet orange and pineapple aroma is off the charts good. "
Got this in a trade. The hype is real with Tree House. They arguably make the best hoppy beers in the country right now. And many beer geeks would argue that they make the best stouts as well. All this with only being about four years old as a brewery.
Love this beer. Dank sticky hoppy goodness. Every TH beer seems to be better than the last. Great citrus/tropical base and favors. Worth the drive to Monson.
"Poured from a can less then a week old into a tulip, thanks to @cannabanoid for the hookup:"
"The aroma is fruity but surprisingly muted. Bursting with flavor, but not as much as Julius. Perfectly balanced mouthfeel and carbonation levels. Overall, incredible IPA!"
"16 oz can. Pours turbid orange with two finger fluffy white head, fades slowly with tons of lace. Tropical fruity aroma. Taste is full of tropical fruit and hint of grass at the end. Pineapple and orange dominate, some peach. Wow this is tasty. Citrus peel and grassy bitterness just at the right level. Nice dry finish. Very soft full mouthfeel. Top notch IPA!"
16oz can poured into 12oz snifter glass
Can shared by Curran today.
Masterful!!
Can dated 10/14/2015.
Best IPA Ive had in life.
10/3 750ml growler. So tasty! Just wished for a little more mouth feel. Can't wait to get this again sometime in the future
Poured from a 16 oz can into a Tree House tulip glass.
L:pours like a classic treehouse ipa cloudy small bubbles
This beer is absolutely gorgeous in a glass. Pours a pithy orange haze that resembles fresh squeezed OJ. Nose is that of cantaloupe and peach with green herbaceous quality. Taste resembles the same with an addition of orange and pineapple dancing around finishes with a soft bitterness. Orange sorbet is spot on with this one mouthfeel is just as creamy as I remember it being. Thank Goodness for green!
"Bought at the brewery on day of canning; dated 10/14/15 and also ""Eggs and Ham""; drank in a teku glass on 10/15/15; another amazing beer by Tree House!"
"Probably my favorite Tree House beer to date. Dank, smooth, tropical, hazy, and just plain delicious. Id take this over Julius 99 out of 100 times. These guys know hops and how to make them shine."
Amazing
Nice hops with a good blend of tropical flavors. Big foam on the head. Aroma hits you right in the face. Just a great ipa. Had this poured fresh from the brewery in a growler. Had a glass with fried onion rings with baked balls of chicken. Definitely an ipa I would recommend to any beer lover
"Terrific citrus notes, but taste is decidedly non-citrus and doesn't measure up to the nose. Bitterness is sharp and lasting, not very pleasant."
"L: Hazy gold with a slight orange hue. Thick, creamy white head with a thick, sticky lacing."
Poured from a growler filled on 10/03/15 into a tulip.
16oz can poured into a globe.
L: Orange-yellow and hazy with a full head.
Typical TH hazy pour.nice head but little retention or lacing. Aroma is a beautiful floral hoppy delight. Flavor follows with a nice balance and awesome mouthfeel. Light finishing bitterness. Delightful IPA
Best brewery in the WORLD
"Getting its name from the tinge of green that had shown through the late stages of the brewing process, Tree House resists shying away from those heavy hopping rates, staying true to the beer's roots and now gracing the tastebuds of New England hop-heads with unabashed apology."
Edit:
"The TH stash is dwindling, but this should be another treat. 16 oz. can into a tulip."
"Beautiful, hazy orange and yellow color with steady one finger head and nice lacing. Aroma really pops with bright citrus, like juice from a freshly peeled orange. Also get pineapple, grapefruit, guava, papaya, and lime. Taste reveals a hop bomb. Not much malt at all. It has a bright lemon-lime kick with peach and stone fruit on the front end and grapefruit pith on the finish. There's pineapple too. This is really fruity as it warms without getting too sweet. Hops really shine through from start to finish. The mouth feel is medium to full, coating the mouth with hops, yet it remains crisp and pops with lively carb. World class IPA."
"Tree House makes the best beers. It is golden orange in color, crazy floral nose, medium body, and absolutely killer."
"Look is really nice and orange. I expected more from smell. Taste is very interesting. Very hoppy and very malty. Very citrusy and hoppy upfront and malty and bitter at the finish. Taste is good but I really love the feel. The carbonation is crisp and on point. Overall, worth the trade. Thanks keithengelke"
Canned about two weeks ago. Tulip glass.
Pours golden haze with a decent head and nice lacing. Aromas of citrus and grapefruit. Taste is almost as great as the aromas. A well balanced mouthfeel with nice carbonation making me want more. Thanks Sulli520 for sharing and first time having TH
Another wonderfully perfect beer from tree house. Very unique bitterness. Tropical flavor with some pine. Wow this is a crazy good ipa. My favorite ipa from tree house to date!
wow. really great title cause green is the perfect name. tastes fresh...very vedgie. great hop.
"Julius gets the bulk of the (well deserved) hype but this guy stands right there next to it and plenty of people will tell you it's better. This thing GLOWS a bright super hazy golden yellow and fills the room with pineapple ad guava notes. Taste is a Mike Tyson punch to the tastebuds of super rich tropical fruit juiciness - pineapple, guava, sweet ripe orange, and lime. The type of beer that makes you forget you're even drinking beer. Again find myself scratching my head as to how these guys produce beers of this quality over and over again. Flawless east coast IPA, even the Russians would give this one 5s across the board"
Poured from a fresh can into a tulip glass.
32oz Growler shipped to Nebraska!
"Wow received in a trade from Jason. Great beer! Appearance of Golden peach hazy orange goodness. Tons of tropical fruit on the nose. taste is similar very juicy with pineapple, pear, slight grapefruit. awesome mouth feel, med to full body hard to tell its 7.6 ABV. Overall this is a great IPA and well worth the high rating."
"Been looking forward to having this for a while. A lot of Tree House fans seem to hold this one above Julius, and I believe they're right. Enjoyed a 16oz pour on tap at the 11th Annual Hophead Throwdown. This beer is super fruity, dank, and even has a bubblegum-like sweetness. Super smooth mouthfeel makes this beer disturbingly drinkable. Loved it."
"Pour is cloudy light orange with a good bit of tight off white head, solid retention. Nose is heavily hopped, has a light grain backbone, tons of bitter grapefruit, lots of citrus, gets almost plastic like aroma its so hopped and has that musky rind their others have had. Full bodied, well carbonated, very silky on the tongue, high bitterness through the very dry finish. Flavor is super hopped, citrus, tons of bitter grapefruit, almost overly bitter."
Poured from a can two weeks old into a tulip glass.
Thanks to rudzud for this one.
"Pours a cloudy dark orange color with a foamy white head. There is some soapy lacing. The odor is powerful, pine, resin, pineapple, citrus, orange, malty, slightly metallic, slight onion, slightly spicy. The taste is citrus orange, honey, pine, resin, grapefruit, slight spice, bitter dry finish."
"This was a very good ipa, slightly bitter but great feel and odor. Very north east for sure, however i didnt super enjoy how bitter it was, nor was it super floral, so overall, not HF, but great non the less"
"No date on the can, but assuming it is fresh. Poured into a TH Teku. Very opaque, looks like beer mixed with OJ. Great tropical fruit aroma, smooth with a mild bitter finish. TH never disappoints."
"Poured hazey Orange with a 2 inch thick white head. Lots of resin hop aroma. First sip is tropical, pineapple and orange peal. Nice lacing all the way down. Bitter, in the best way!"
Love this ipa. It has that perfect turbid glowing orange color with a perfect mouthfeel to match. The hop profile just doesnt pop enough to me to get a perfect score. If treehouse would dry hop this with something like mosaic or citra this beer could be a 5.
"Super hazy orange with a gold glow, small white head and decent lacing. Notes of pineapple, orange, citrus rind, lemon candy, and lemongrass. Creamy medium body, semi dry and slightly bitter. Amazing IPA!"
"Poured from a 2 liter growler filled on 7/23/15 and consumed with a buddy of mine on 7/25/15. Fantastic IPA. First couple of sips had a surprisingly bitter taste at the mid-palate and on the back end, but this bitterness almost completely disappeared just a couple of minutes later. Moving forward after the first couple of sips, just five minutes later this beer completely smoothed out almost entirely, and just became another great, crisp and smooth IPA from Tree House. Gives Julius a run for its money, no question about it..."
This beer is hoppy. complex. Smells great. looks even better.
"Pours a cloudy hazy orange yellow. Smells like citrusy hops, orange grapefruit? Taste is a citrus explosion getting strong orange flavors and grapefruit/peel bitterness. Hop residue and bitterness sits around in the mouth for a while. Nice slight carbonation."
"A: Perfect. Nice super cloudy pale orange, good white head, nice lacing."
"Call me impressionable, but I was expecting this to taste and smell greener. "
"Top notch ipa. Another one off the charts from tree house... probably the best beer I've ever had! Simply amazing stuff, acquire some and drink it all! DO NOT SHARE! lol"
"Julius gets a lot of the hype, but this beer has it beat, especially if you are in search of a hop-loaded beast that will wreck your palate. Yet, it's never enough to make you want to stop drinking. If you like Heady Topper, this is a must try. Do I dare say this one is better than Heady?"
Fresh 16oz. can poured into a snifter tasting glass.
Just a beautiful beer. Big frothy head. Super creamy brew. Big citrus nose. Taste is citrus and dank all at once. Perfect balance. One of the best I've had - up there with Hill Farmstead for sure. A touch bitter in the finish but it's clean and not lingering. Pretty much perfection.
"L - Pours into a chalice a cloudy, mellow yellow...or two shades darker than Mountain Dew!"
Growler poured into antique pilsener beer glass
Nothing else to say but this is the best beer ever made period.
Preferred this to Julius by a small margin. Drank with more heft and flavor by a small margin.
If you like a bitter IPA this beer has all of that plus more. It has a hoppy flavor that explodes in your mouth with each sip. You will love the citrus bite you get. It is a great IPA.
"A - hazy, orange opaque body, 1 finger sticky head"
"Pours a hazy peach-tangerine. Notable fresh cut hop presence on nose. Grass, pine, passionfruit, citrus mélange, passionfruit. Taste earthy orange, lime kaffir, sweet pineapple aloft soft malt background. Soft body, smooth feel and the best hoppy beer that I've had from them."
"Pours chalky vibrant orange with a solid two finger head. Smells of delicious citrus and juice with some subtle pine, sticky hops. Taste is a splash of fruit juice, orange, very bright followed by bitter. Very crisp and refreshing. Finish is dry and peppery. Mouthfeel is frothy and pillowy, perhaps only slightly on the light side. The first sip of this beer is really like a blast of fresh tropical air. This is really an exceptional IPA. Easy to drink, and wonderful color, smell, and flavor. This beer is so good that it deserves to be sought after on its own."
"Pours a straw like color. This beers smell is hop on top of hop on top of hop!! HUGE hop nose. Taste starts off as a hop bomb, then tropic fruit notes, mostly pineapple, then finishes off with a nice lingering bitter taste. I love this beer. Gives Julius a run for its money!"
From a fresh can poured into a teku class.
Best beer ever and out of a can. Creamy mouthfeel. Hops aroma comes out of the can like two sensuous hands grabbing you behind the head. The beer tastes like sweet fruity hops with a modest malt backbone. I want a lot more of this.
my favorite from Treehouse! keep killing it guys.
Opaque orangish tropical fruit looking. Wonderful citrus nose. Taste of tropical fruits like papaya and pineapple which moves into a bitter finish a the end. Smooth mouth feel. Another good Tree House offering
"Look: Dense peachy orange color in my Tulip glass. Cannot see through glass. One finger hear, nice lacing"
Outstanding!!! Not sure if there is a better IPA out there at the moment.
L: hazy pale gold with a creamy head
16oz can from Steve000 (thanks man). No canning info. Served in a goblet. 
"From a can dated August 13, 2015. This one is so good - one of my favorites from Tree House. So juicy, with an incredible hop profile. This may be better than Julius."
"I enjoyed this more than Julius. Has every quality an IPA should have as far as looks, nose, flavor, and feel are concerned. Gorgeous head. Super sticky, resiny, and piney. Thick with hop oils. A massively hopped, well-crafted beer that just hits the spot more than Julius (both in cans and growler)."
16oz can. Served in a stemmed glass.
"Another citrus bomb in a can, but not to the extent of ""Julius"". Melons, tangerine, grapefruit and oranges can be detected both in aroma and taste. Crisp, earthy mouthfeel, but wished there was more of a hoppy kick to it. Very soft, pillowy body with no bitterness."
My favorite TH to date. Pine/ resin/ melon come to mind. Reminiscent of Vicinity by Trillium. Very good!
"With a recent trip to Tree House Brewing Company, I was able to try a bunch of their amazing beers. This is up there with the Julius in terms of my favorite. It's a near perfect DIPA with juicy flavors and a full mouth feel. Until I can land some King Julius and Haze, this will remain numero dos on my TH list."
"Oily and uber-smooth... rich with hops, muted citrus flavors, and a nice bitter finish... somewhere between the piney flavors of SAP and the citrus notes of Julius... another incredibly crushable ale from TH!!"
Exceptionally creamy with blasts of fruit notes. Ridiculously drinkable! I am so grateful to have had this sent to me it is phenomenal!
"Wasn't impressed with this beer, which is shocking bc I love every other beer I had from tree house (sap, JULIUS, c14, c15, lights on). Also heard so much about it and justt was disapponted. Thought It was thin on flavor and bite and a lil more of a watery taste at the end"
"16 oz can from a recent batch. Poured hazy orange into a TH tulip. Creamy off white head. Looks like a hop milkshake. Aroma is pure galaxy hops....sweet candy and tropical fruit. Flavor is exactly as the nose. Tropical fruits with sweet candy hints that pop in. Feel is creamy for a single IPA. Overall, this is one of my favorites by TH. Love this beer."
Marijuana is the sister plant to hops many Breweries say. This been has a weed type taste. Very different beer. Nice and hoppy. All types of fruit explosions come off this taste..
I picked this up at the brewery in a 2L growler
16oz can (thanks Darwin!!) poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass 
"Thanks to my friend Ian for bringing this with him to NJ. 16 oz can split between him and I. We had the Sap right before this and we've moved on to the Green. Amber in color and so cloudy that you can't see your fingers on the other side. Aroma is awesome, the kind that keeps you going back to smell the beer more often than you actually drink it. Tons of pineapple, orange citrus, and tropical fruits. Medium bodied despite the somewhat strong ABV. So smooth, juicy, and delicious. A stellar IPA from Tree House!"
"Such an earthy, grassy IPA. I can see why they named it green and put their tree logo on the can"
Really great IPA... Tree House is so consistant..
L - bright golden hazy color
Poured out as a hazy golden color with a white head on top. The aroma is loaded with the tropical Australian hops. The taste has a juiciness upfront that settles into a good bitterness. The feel is very smooth. Overall the beer is pretty solid. Not my favorite from Tree House but it's still very good.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a Tree House tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery 2 days ago. 
"In talking to many of the Tree House faithful, Green gets mentioned in the ""favorite beer"" conversation quite often, edging out even Julius on multiple occasions."
"Aroma - A tropical island of tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and a little marijuana for island authenticity."
this is by far my favorite Tree House offering. It's a near perfect DIPA. Big and Juicy. Full mouth feel. I would pick this as a desert island beer for sure
"Cloudy, burnt-orange color with 1/2 inch foam that sticks to the glass leaving a thin layer that never lets you see through it"
Wow. Julius is great but Green is even better! Green > Julius
Too many descriptions below... this is a helluva damn beer.
"From the can, finally! "
"not particularly crazy about this beer. murky yellow/tanish appearance with a tropical new england scent (if one ever existed?). taste is similar to what i'd imagine a load of fresh grass clippings and hops would bring to a beer. mouthfeel was dry. overall, the high abv is masked well and this is DANGEROUSLY drinkable for the style. A must try."
Appearance: pours a light honey to straw yellow color. a 2-3 finger white foamy head with strong retention and leaving behind a strong lacing. super hazy and murky. completely opaque.
Second or third time around with this one thanks to generous friends sharing it in the past. Filled 9 days ago and kept in a very cold fridge since.
Growler was poured into a nonic glass. 
"A splendid IPA. Hop soda, but not overpowering. As an added bonus, it's much closer to me than VT."
Funny aftertaste. It may be the Australian Hops.
"Pours extremely turbid, big white fluffy head, plenty of leasing. Overwhelming smell of tropical hops. They start suite with an extremely intense tropical hop flavor, followed by an assertive slightly unpleasant bitterness . I think many would characterize it as hop burn. For creamy mouth feel. A good beer but one that lacks complexity to be great ."
poured from can 
750ml THB swing-top bottle filled at the brewery. 
Smells like orange juice. Citrusy and piney taste. Pretty damn cloudy.
I like this beer better than Julius and it's not close (and I like Julius). 
"Pours a gorgeous hazy orange color, good lacing on the glass. Smell is earthy, dank and juicy. Bursts with juicy flavor, dank hops come through perfectly. Smooth mouthfeel. Amazing every time I'm able to get this one"
"Appearance: Hazed orange-gold with some honeyed elements. Head is bright-white, sticky, and clumpy. Moderate head formation to start drops to a wispy cap, chunky loose collar, and lacing for days. Super sticky notches and ropes of lacing."
Sept. 13 dated 750ml growler poured into a Tree House tulip. 
"Picked up a few 750ml bottles of this on my first visit to the brewery. Great place, great guys, great beer. This IPA is bursting with out of this world flavor and it goes down way too easy. As much as I love Julius I can see why this is quickly getting a following. Get some if you can."
Poured from a 1 pint bottle into a Treehouse Brewing stemmed glass.
750ml growler fill at the brewery.
"Turbid as hell. I can smell this from accross the room. Pineapple juice. Spicy, grassy, dank and bursting with tropical fruit. Papaya, pineapple and mangoes. Some underlying citrus rind bitterness. Dry finish. Awesome."
750ml bottle filled at the brewery yesterday. 
brought by a friend of a friend at that friend's daughter's 2nd birthday party. 
"L - the best looking beer I've ever seen. Hell, it's practically named after how good it looks! Beautiful turbid, murky tangerine color with an almost mystical aura surrounding it. A glowing orb of deep orange with radioactive green-hued fringes at the edges of the glass. Amazing how it conforms to any shaped glass and makes it work. Gorgeous. "
Poured from a 750ml into a tulip glass
750 mL growler poured into a snifter. 
"A - Arrived in a Tree House tulip glass with 1 finger of head. The beer is a beautiful orange-copper, with (and maybe this is in my head) a subtle tinge of green in it? A little hazy. The head is creamy and leaves inconsistent buy distinct lacing on the glass."
"Growler straight from the brewery consumed 10-19-13, and other bottle consumed 10-25-13"
"2L growler, filled about 7 hours ago from the source, split amongst some people."
"Growler filled yesterday at the brewery. So glad this came back around so I can finally review it and enjoy it. I can't think of a better time to drink this, Sunday afternoon, waning days of summer, heavy thunderstorms reign down outside, with torrential downpours. It was the kind of rain that forced a 10 mph drive home from the supermarket as the rain poured in sheets over the windshield making it almost impossible to see, as well as a flood of water cascading down the street almost making it possible to swim the car home."
Growler fill from Tree House Brewing poured into my Tree House tulip glass.
Reviewed from notes as I received a growler of this from BPK59. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
750ml growler filled at the brewery earlier today and poured into Tree House glass.
"16oz can. Pours a hazy burnt orange color with an inch of frothy head. Good deal of lacing. The aroma is citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple, peach and orange. Some dank/grassy hops also. The taste is more dank than expected but still has a good deal of fruit flavor. Mango, papaya, pineapple and peach. Bready malts towards the end with some more grassy and dank hops. Medium to heavy body with a bit of a dry mouthfeel. Good deal of alcohol warmth."
Canned on 10/9/18
"I found out I had a Treehouse beer and I got giddy like a schoolboy about to play in the dirt. My first Treehouse beer and the ratings on this beer is high. Let us get to the review. I love the label on this beer a black label with dark purple, way cool. The beer is 47 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The gentle pour produced a two finger bright white head. The head is creamy and airy with good retention. Lacing was left on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold with amber hues. Clarity of the beer is hazy from the yeast. Overall, a solid appearance for this beer. "
look: like peach orange juice with pulp I imagine. Sudsy plush head on the pour that mostly recedes.
Had a can thanks to Shawn. Overall Very good well crafted. Thought the tropical fruit tones were muted but complex and delicious. Very soft easy mouthfeel for a canned beer.
Reminds me a lot of other New England double IPA. The greatness of this beer is the piney smell as well as the hoppiness and long aftertaste. Reminds me of Heady Topper.
"Thanks to jlindros for hooking this up (and a bunch of other beers). Pours a hazy yellow with 1/3"" white head on the top. Aroma was citrus, didn't pop tropical fruit on this one, just seemed like a hearty dose of Citra hops and maybe just a drop of stone fruit aroma. Doesn't seem to be dry hopped any bigger or better than the big boys out here (Monkish/Cellarmaker/Moonraker/Alvarado/Revision) that make comparable stuff. "
"Enjoying from my brand new tulip glass. What a nose - keeps delivering citrus with every swirl. I find it just a bit more bitter on the tongue than expected, but the taste and mouth feel are still great. Overall, certainly a top DIPA!"
Poured into a Alchemy 13 oz Teku glass canned 9/12/18. Pours a very hazy dark orange yellow with a massive 2 plus finger head that leaves thin wisps of lace throughout. 4.75
Canned 15 days ago.
"06/2016 - Pineapple, light peach, a notable floral on the nose; super soft and juicy flavors, with more of that scrumptious fruitiness; creamy, slightly sweet finish."
10 days in the can.
Arguably my favorite beer.
"Bought a can at Tree House. Beer pours with a cloudy, gold yellow color with some patchy lacing and a thin head. Very nice and balanced citrus fruit flavors like peaches, oranges, grapefruit, mango. Taste follows the nose but again, nothing too overpowering. Very well balanced and approachable to me. Good body with medium carbonation. Overall, vocal flavors but very well balanced."
"16oz can: This one pours a murky slightly orange hued golden color. There was really no head or lacing on it. A really nice nose. Lots of aromas, with nothing really predominate. Tropical, citrus, a good amount of dankness, some spiciness. The taste is definitely a wow. Dank citrus, some spices, tropical flavors, juicy but not much sweetness. A touch bitter. REALLY nice!"
These Brewers are at the top of their game! A good all around DIPA. Look forward to my next one!
Can dated 08/08/2018.
"What stuck out to me most with Doppleganger was its nose. Rich, almost intrusive dankness. The taste delivered on the dank but in classic Tree House fashion it was delivered in a nice soft fluffy blanket"
Doesn’t get much better than this.
Dang delicious
poured into a pint glass via can
"I got this today 6/15, it was canned today 6/15! That's a first for me. It's really a fine well balanced ne iipa. My first TH beer. It's good not great. Certainly a quality brew, lacks any real fruityness. Nice and cloudy. So far not as good as trillium cutting tiles or 45, but very enjoyable for sure. Hoping with all the hype the others are better."
Very good balance of east vs West vs NE in an ipa.
"Picked-up eight cans at the Tree House Brewery on Wednesday, for somewhere between four and five dollars per can. This is my 6th brew from these guys. Very smooth, solid brew. More malt/wesside, less juice/easside."
"Canned 4/19. Deep orange color with great head and lacing! Nose is very subdued...almost non-existent. Lovely flavor though with citrus, tropical notes. Full mouthfeel but very soft and well carbonated. Smooth finish."
"L: poured into a Sam smith pint glass. Pours originally a solid head, great retention, beer looks like every other treehouse beer you’ve had really"
"Purchased in Charlton on April 25th, 2018. Walking out with several cases of TH beer is a different experience. I've got to assume this affects my perception of the beer. When you have maybe a dozen TH beers vs having a few cases the excitement is different. That's not a bad thing but taste perception has to be affected."
"poured a mild orange. very subtle but delicious smell of citrus and very slight hops. The taste was amazing with the citrus (orange/tangerine), cream and again slight hops. The mouthfeel was very smooth. an incredible 2xIPA."
A: cloudy; deep gold in color; 1+ finger off white head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;
"Alter Ego's Big Brother. Dry-hopped, citrusy juicebomb with a flavor that keeps going and going. Fruity, beautifully cloudy in the glass. Really top-notch effort. Taste the brilliance."
"Better than some, bit not than others. Another iteration from Treehouse of a great beer. This one sits right in the middle of their IPAs to me, but not super memorable."
Canned 5/9/18; drank 5/24/18 @ the Yarchives. 
L - 2-finger silky white head atop a murky orange body.
"Can: Poured a hazy/cloudy bright yellow color ale with a medium size white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dank hoppy notes with some dry citrusy notes and subtle tropical notes. Taste is a mix of huge dank notes with some citrusy notes, some tropical flavours and a dryer finish then expected with some hints of residual sugar. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Enjoyable IIPA with a dryer finish than expected."
"What stands out to me about Doppelgänger is the incredibly smooth mouthfeel for a double IPA. I live close enough to Tree House to have tried most of their beers, and this is one of my favorites."
"Decanted from a 16 oz (453 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; canned 03/15/18, code REMAX"
Top Brew. A must try
"Not the best from Treehouse. I was disappointed in the muted aroma, and the grassy/onion flavors are a little too harsh."
Canned on 3-28-18
"Fine as a classic wine, easy drinking wonderfully balanced, excellent mouthfeel. Am I missing anything? This is a wonderful example of refined and explosive."
"pours a hazy orange with a thick creamy head, looks amazing"
"Poured a very hazy peach color with a white foamy head. Picked up ton of mango, fresh oranges, papaya, and just a hint of banana to the nose. Its insanely fruity and tropical. Not overly hoppy; I can only picture this as a tall glass of fruit smoothie. The taste is just the same. It starts out sweet with mango, oranges and papaya. It's so.... very juicy...I just can't say it enough. Its like drinking a homemade smoothie, blend all the tropical frozen fruits and voila, you have this beer. No trace of bitterness. The mouthfeel even lends a smooth and creamy feel. This beer has lived up to its hype. It's masterpiece that artfully blend the hops and malt creating this tasty DIPA."
Looks and tastes like a spiked oj!?
"16 oz can, dated 2/20/18, poured into a teku"
Appearance: A beautiful deep orange with a 1.25 inch white head.
One of my favorite beers!
Canned 2 weeks ago and tried alongside a three-week-old can of Alter Ego
This beer has a great texture. The aroma is as expected. The flavor is spot on. This is a great sipping beer. I enjoyed one with my breakfast as well and can’t wait to do it again.
"Good times courtesy of Tree House... Julius + lots of Mosaic and ""kiss"" of Amarillo... basically the DIPA version of Alter Ego, kettle and dry hopped... Juice beer, featuring lots of citrus and a danker undertone... Smooth but with some tang and zest, amply carbonated, mildly sweet, moderately bitter... Presents impressions of grapefruit and pineapple, maybe some passion fruit and papaya and mango - has an almost creaminess to it... 1/31/18 canning..."
"Another great Tree House brew, potent 2x IPA but doesn't overpower. One of the most drinkable 2x IPAs on the market."
Tall can - 1/31/18 printed on the bottom
"This beer pours a completely opaque golden orange color with a 2 finger, creamy, sudsy, bright white head. Retention is excellent and there are thick, sticky rings of lacing left all over the glass."
"Pours a cloudy yellow orange color with a small foamy head. Retention is mild. Lacing is good. Aroma is excellent. Deep, rich citrus. Rich citrus aroma. Papaya and pineapple. Medium bodied with mild carbonation."
"Hazy, juicy looking but not as thick as a smoothie look. White head. "
"Pours cloudy opaque bright orange with a 1 finger white head. Great retention! Aroma- peach, mango, papaya, a little strawberry and just a slight slight watermelon. Taste- mango, peach, pineapple, papaya. A little buttery and biscuity. No bitterness. Tastes very good! Mouthfeel is pretty fluffy and soft, but a bit thin. Overall- fantastic juicy beer! Really loving it!"
Canned 1.16.18
"16oz can from the brewery, I bought a bunch and drank them over the last several weeks. Dark orange and hazy, great lacing. Lots of fruit in the aroma and flavor, slightly sweet, no bitterness, peach preserves. Tasty."
Best DIPA I’ve ever had
"Deep, nectar-like color with murky oranges and yellows. The head is tall and fluffy, 2 fingers and just all foam. "
Hazy amber color with creamy two finger head. Smells of peach and apricot with some subtle dank aromas. Tastes of sweet peach and apricot with bitter grapefruit and lemon rind. There's some spice which also leaves a bit of a zip to the tongue. Nice smooth carbonation. My favorite from Tree House.
"Excellent beer. A little yeasty on the nose, nice color and feel; Tree House still dominates the IPA world."
"Smooth mouth feel as we all expect from Treehouse. Aroma left something to be desired, but thlavor is fruity and delicious. Glad I sought this out and would do so again"
"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew, again."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a one inch white head that left a fair amount of lacing. Smells like fruit juice with a hint of pine. Tastes of peach, mango, papaya, orange, a bit of orange, rind, some sweet malts and finishes with a bitter resin bite. Medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, finishes slightly dry and bitter."
Been going to TreeHouse for 4 years now and finally got my hands on this brew. Like all TH beers this one lives up to the hype. Super strong aroma as soon as you crack the can. It smells like hop heaven and the taste is even stronger. Tropical flavors right away and then a smooth malt finish. At 8 percent ABV it's surprisingly smooth and drinkable. I could drink this brew all day long and not be disappointed. Cheers!
"I've finally been working my way through TH offerings and I feel like this is probably the second best I've had next to Green. Quintessential NE DIPA, would love to have this again."
Pours a hazy orange with two fingers white head.

Heaven on Earth.
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass 1.5 weeks after the release (11-3-2017 batch). Appearance is opaque and bright orange (some yellow) in color with 2-3 finger thick white head (good retention). Smell is noticeably Mosaic up front with blueberry and slight onion notes, but there is a lot of earthy hop flavor as well. There are also notes of citrus (grapefruit/orange) and a hint of pine and caramel sweetness. "
Outstanding
"Eh....Treehouse makes awesome IPAs- Haze, Bright, Green. This feels/looks like the juice box IPA - muddy, super sweet/sugary and juicy. Not really my thing."
16oz can dated 9/13/17.
Pours opaque orange colpr with thin head - not good lacing. Aroma is dank and rich with citrus and stone fruit notes. Taste follows smell with a good thickness to the taste. Bitterness is moderate. This is a great beer. Great full flavor and awesome feel.
Look- Hazy orange with fluffy marshmallow head
Well....pretty damn awesome. Gorgeous orange haze with nice white head. The flavor is very fruity. You could probably pick up almost all citrus and tropical fruits. Clean finish with nice after taste. Very near perfect.
There's literally no detectable bitterness at all.....in an 8.2% DIPA. It really is crazy. It's like straight juice. It's the IPA version of trying a blond stout for the first time and you don't know what to do with yourself.

"Can from Dave M, thanks for the hookup!"
"16Oz can dated 9/13 purchased at the brewery. Our 2nd TH beer and all I have to say is WOW! A turbid orange color and citrusy nose is followed by complex flavors that may include pineapple, orange, lemon and a small touch of grapefruit especially on the finish. The mouthfeel is creamier than any beer we've had so far. A very enjoyable, easy drinking and delicious beer that I can't wait to have again."
"Doppelganger is very hazy, murky gold to peachy orange. The head sparkles at two inches, pale orange and creamy. The head gradually becomes rocky forming a pillow while sticky thick lace coats the IIPA glass."
"16oz can, dated 09.13.17, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. "
Big brother to AE. This beer is incredible with an extreme mouthfeel hitting all your tastebuds. Get it if you can.

"One of the best IPAs I have had in a while, and I've had a few."
Reviewed from notes on 4/6/17
"Pours a hazy golden orange. Citrus nose comprised of mostly grapefruit and tangerine, along with mango and some piney hops. Tropical fruits of mango and pineapple dominate the taste along with some citrus and a touch of bubblegum. Full, soft, and smooth on the palate. Another fine beer from Tree House!"
"An almost perfectly balanced juice bomb from Treehouse! Smells of citrus, mango, peach with a flavor that follows the nose. Medium body and fantastic finish. Love this beer the balance is amazing!"
"Incredible! Tasted from can. Pours a super orange yellow with white head. Aroma is robust citrus and tropical fruits with orange, mango, papaya, and grapefruit. Flavor similar to nose in that it's a super fruity IPA with faint resinous note. Caramel cracker backbone makes this well balanced and extremely crushable. Hides ABV extremely well. Would put this up against any IPA I've ever had."
"Pours an opaque orange-ish hue. Some nice aroma of sugar cane. It's definitely juicy characteristics. Sugar cane, melon, and a touch of citrus. There's a touch of soapiness on the finish in addition to that soft bubblegummy yeast character. This is one of the best mosaic beers I've ever had. Not on the S&S #6 or DDHDMD level but damn good."
A - Pours a turbid golden orange with a two finger fizzy white head. The head recedes rather quickly leaving a heavy amount of soapy lacing.
some IPAs you can sit on for 4-7 weeks ... many even improve with some short term age on them. this was not one of em! at 6.5 weeks old this one is drinking absolutely brutal. definitely need to try it again as im sure its an excellent offering but sadly did not hold up and couldnt finish this.
Cloudy Orange straw appearance with significant white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very hoppy with a hint of citrus. Taste is a nice balance of hoppy and grapefruit orange citrus.
"Good beer, but I'm not waiting in line for it."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a large fluffy white head. The head has good retention with medium low carbonation. It smells of melon, peach, cotton candy, and bubblegum. The beer tastes of melon, peach, cotton candy, and bubblegum. It is very soft with a light mouthfeel. This is another great core beer from Tree House."
This thing was a beauty to look at. Absolutely incredible color and soap foam head that lasted for a few minutes. These guys helped kickstart the NE IPA craze and I can see why it caught on. Can't wait to try more of their stuff one day.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy amber the a thick head; good retention and strands of lacing hang around
Look: A bland looking orange that I can't see through with a fluffy white head to it.
L: Pours an opaque orangish yellow color with about a finger and a half of head.
"Appearance: pours an opaque golden yellow color with 1"" head that slowly falls to a long lasting thin surface covering."
"From a 16oz can, dated 06/21/17... be groovy or leave man - presumably there should be a comma in there. Served in a tulip."
"This beer ruined me... every double ipa I've tried since, just doesn't measure up. Amazing beer!"
Such a great beer! Had to wait awhile to get this one just like Haze. Had them on my list of must have beers and the wait eventually paid off. Found some great traders in my short time on this site and they were able to help me find this brew.
I honestly feel like Doppelgänger doesn't get the respect it deserves. An incredible beer with an amazing taste and hazy look. Highly underrated!
This is a great and underrated beer. I love Alter Ego and I love Doubleganger. But this is better than both of them. Plus it's a Tree House IPA so how can you go wrong.
"Orange, mango, melon. Some sips offer peach. Herbal hop notes with inadequate carbonation and a medium to full mouth feel. It's not the best beer from Tree House."
"16 oz can dated May 18, 2017. Poured into Veil anniversary glass."
"Traded for this recently, as the beer had a date of 4/27 with ""STILL GONNA"" written above it and ""SEND IT!"" written below it. I love all of the other Tree House beers that I've had over the years and this one was no exception as it just kept getting better as it warmed up. It was one of those beers that didn't have anything outstanding in particular about it but when everything came together, the end result was a pint glass that didn't stay filled for very long!"
Excellent DIPA. Well balanced and delicious.
"Poured into a Teku glass. A murky orange color, it's not entirely opaque from haze but pretty close. The head is slightly off-white with good retention. The aroma isn't super prominent, but has tropical fruit presence. The taste is flush with huge tropical fruits as well- mango, guava, peach, orange, tangerine, with a hint of bitterness and resin on the finish. The feel is creamy and smooth, goes down very well with a hint of heat at the finish. Overall, an outstanding beer. The aroma left something to be desired, but the other categories more than make up for it. Treehouse living up to the hype once again!"
"Poured from a can dated 5/18/17 into a Teku. Extremely hazy but not turbid with a bright golden and a medium sized head that slowly settled. Aromas of tropical fruit, oranges, and some dank resin. The taste followed with huge fruity notes mixed with herbal notes. A sweet bubblegum sensation on the finish. Very soft feel and dry, bready finish. World class."
A: deep cloudy opaque murky orange to almost green. Creamy thick pancake batter head. 
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.Canned on 05/18/17.Says ""Say Hello To Heaven"" on the bottom,in tribute to Chris Cornell."
"Pours a murky, cloudy, completely-opaque dark-ish orange with two fingers of off-white head foaming on top. Great head retention, with tightly packed lacing left behind. Aroma is soaked to the core with hop notes, with a focus on citrus. Orange, tangerine, papaya, and lemon zest form a sort of Vitamin C nuke aroma. Flavor profile follows along, opening with orange and clementine, and then developing into a full armament of citrus notes - tangerine, papaya, peach, and apricot. Mouth feel starts out smooth and juice-like, but develops a sort of fizzy, graininess that is a little harsh as it warms on the tongue. Overall, flavor is an understatement here. Loads and loads of citrus qualities through both the aroma and flavor profile. It's a fun sipper of a beer, considering how easy it is to drink, and yet the breadth of hop notes it delivers. The clear dynamics in how the flavor profile ebbs and flows throughout the drinking experience is what sets it apart from other NE IPAs. Surprised to see this hits in at 8.2%, as it doesn't taste like it one bit. Wonderful. "
"Poured from a can dated 4/27/17 (on 5/7/17) from the fridge into a Teku. This was obtained by trade from someone in MA, and it is possible it was stored at room temp for a week."
"Hazy mango nectar with a single finger head that laces everywhere. The aromas are intoxicating. Sweet tropical fruits, fresh pine, some fresh bread, and a touch of alcohol. Rich mango and welcome bitter hops explode without any evidence that this is a big DIPA. Creamy on the palette with low carbonation. The bitter hops show up again on the back of the throats without ever being overpowering, leaving a welcome subtle heat. Always looking forward to spending time with this beast."
Poured into a teku pint. Bottom of can says 03 24 17.
"Pours a very murky orange, with low head."
Poured into a treehouse tulip. 
Poured from can. Look is amber gold and hazy. Smell is about as floral as I've experienced. Love that. Taste is sweet and smooth- get a little grapefruit on it. No lingering bitterness. World class.
"Bottle at Tree House. Clear golden body. Big white head. Smells of lemon, oats, wheat. Nice brett. Tastes of lemon tartness, oats and wheat. A bit of pale malt sweetness. Grainy finish. Medium body. Tasty sour."
"Thanks for the share, Josh."
"I thought Haze was my favorite TH, but this may take the spot. "
Good looking pulpy light orange/lemon yellow brew. Aroma is quite juicy and a little peppery.
"L: cloudy, yellow/gold color, nice head, tons of lacing"
"First had at B.T.'s Smokehouse, Sturbridge, Mass., a brewery-recommended BYOB stop, with BBQ brisket, poured from pint can into old-fashioned, dimpled red plastic, repurposed large Pizza Hut drink cup, but waited to review until poured second pint can into Nonic pint. My first beer from Tree House, this is an amazingly soft and subtle Double IPA."
turbid orange yellow medium bubbles thick headed
"First had 3/4/17 at Adam's house. Got a growler from the brewery delivered from Andy. Pours hazy, cloudy, and yellow. Smells of citrus and hops. Tastes like a Julius on steroids, juicy, bitter, and finishes with some hop oil. Fantastic all around, will most definitely seek out more."
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Hazy as all hell which is typical for a Tree House IPA with a straw yellow color. A bright citrus nose that gets you ready for your first sip. The taste is juicy up front with a mild bitterness on the finish. Slightly heavier mouth feel than most of the Tree House beers that I've had but probably because of the higher ABV. Overall a great beer that I will seek again in the future.
A: darker pale malt with some caramel colors added to the base most Tree House beers have. Standard frothy head. Sticky lacing. Visible sediment in my glass
"Can poured into pint glass; hazy, burnt gold color with soft, creamy white head. Fruits (mango, orange, peach) greet the nose with modest hint of hops. Medium feel on the palate with sweetness of fruits and bitterness of hops well balanced. Another TH success!"
64oz growler poured into tulip
good beer. Not as juicy or hoppy as other treehouse. a little too much bite at the end. But overall good beer. I mean come on its still a tree house.
"Canned 1/24/17, so about a week old from the review date."
Look: super hazy lightyear yellow orange with a big thick 1-1.5 inch head 
Pours a very hazy orange with a tall white short lasting head
appearance-Orange amber in color and turbid. Pours a dense two inch head.
"This beer is perfect to me... Juicy taste with powerful orange/grapefruit notes.. my mouth is watering waiting for the next sip.. But it's the bitter finish that does it for me....IMO it's the best beer I have ever had...Over Heady, SOS.."
"16oz can, sample from the brewery. "
Canned 01-22-16. Drank 01-24-16.
Incred
"The pour is a super cloudy, medium orange hue typical of most TH beers. Tight bubbled white head with excellent lacing. I'm getting a nice amount of blueberry in the aroma, reminiscent of most fresh mosiac IPA's. Nice amount of kiwi, papaya and melon present as well. Interesting honey and nectarine comes out more as it warms. The taste is typical of most TreeHouse offerings, with a slight more cracker-like sweet malt profile. Still a juice bomb nonetheless, plenty of tropical fruit. Not much complexity with the hop profile. Mouthfeel is a little palate coating, and finishes dry that leaves you wanting more. Another solid TH IPA, they truly never disappoint."
"Exceptionally wonderful beer. Pours an opaque light amber color. Head dissipates quickly. Extremely aromatic. Smells of honey, melons, and oranges. Tastes like a microscopic Monica Bellucci waltzing on your tongue after bathing in a tropical elixir. Perfect hit of bitterness to keep you looking for that next sip. Body is medium - perfectly soft and velvety. Easily one of my favorites from TH."
"Been going there since 2014, back in the little red building, I love J and Green and Alter but this last visit (90 min line!! 35F, brrr...) the Doppel I got is really really outstanding, just wish I could get 2x, cant wait till Charlton is finished and comes on stream and it's 10 miles closer for me ;-)"
Deephazy orange color
Drank the day after I brought it home from the brewery out of a TEKU.
Spectacular Double IPA. Malt forward and beautiful hop character. Aroma is excellent - smells like you are standing in the brewery. Waited in line 90+ minutes to get 5 cans 600+/- people in line on 12/21/16 on a 37 degree day. It was my first time there. The number of different fruit characteristics in this is amazing two+ finger head and nice lacing on the glass. 
Thanks again to Kegatron for the hookup. Pounder can into a tulip appears like extra pulp orange juice blend with 2 fingers white head composed of large bubbles that fades leaving a full wall of lace.
Nice beer
Delicious easy to drink Double IPA. Nice color.. good middle ground being hazy and filtered.
"Changing my rating on this, still tasting incredible at about 4 weeks out. I am thinking I like it better than Julius at this point!"
Pours a turbid darker yellow. Smells fantastic. Citrus and mango are predominant. Taste is a like eating a citrus fruit rind. Love the mouth feel on the beer as well. I could perceive the beer coating my mouth with a creamy film. Another very well made brew from Tree House.
"Cloudy, dank, fruity, smooth! Solid. Very enjoyable beer."
"Happy Repeal Day! Pours a hazy yellow orange color leaning slightly towards the red spectrum. Smell is predominantly citrus with orange predominating but you also get hints of lemon and lime; very different than Alter Ego which is more tropical fruit. Taste follows the smell with a sweet citrusy front end that once again has orange predominating. There is definitely a little more bitter resiny bite to this beer but it is still super balanced and falls on the juicy side as opposed to the piney hop resin side of some of the other very TH variants (Very Green for instance). This is actually the first very variant that I have enjoyed more than the original brew. The feel on this beer is medium bodied, silky, and balanced. This beer is very reminiscent of regular Haze in the citrus forward nature of the beer. The aftertaste is where it stands out as the resiny bite of the hops lingers for longer than most of the regular treehouse brews. Even though, the beer is extremely balanced and is not overly bitter. I definitely enjoy this brew over regular Alter Ego as there is much more going on and the flavors pop a bit more (I find alter ego to be a bit muted). Great brew, as always from Tree House!"
"Pours a light hazy yellow, a little head and lacing goes down the glass. Aroma of fresh herbs, pine, grass, citrus and a little dank tropical. In the taste, super tropical and very bitter, but smooth and enjoyable at that. It has orange peel, pineapple and some resinous, herbal notes. Light bodied and crisp. A really nice brew."
"Canned 10 days ago from drinking, amazing bright orange creamy pour with good amount of head, nice is so complex for an IPA, super citrusy, mellow hoppiness with a bite on the aroma, taste follows as just an amazing DIPA creamy juice bomb with good amount of piney, dry, bitterness on the end. Easily lives to the hype of tree house DIPA!"
Poured from a can into my Tired Hands teku glass.
"Murky opaque orange, thin layer of foam that breaks quickly. Webby broken skim across the surface, spotty lace."
"Drank from a 1 pint, 9.4 fluid ounces stopple top growler purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
Poured 16 oz can into pint glass. Typical TH deep honey color with no clarity whatsoever. Creamy head with sticky lacing. Very juicy aroma and the taste follows. Perfect malt hop balance. Typical fluffy TH mouthfeel. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. One of my favorites in the regular rotation.
look is juicy. 
"Super hoppy. Probably a little lighter and harder after bite than other tree house beers, but wow is it still way better than everything else. I loved this beer and would highly recommend it to anyone."
Had this from a 750ml growler into a Tree House teku. 
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma is really hoppy with an interesting citrusy and grassy/herbal profile. Taste follows, lots of grassy hops, peaches, medium to light bitterness on the finish with lingering pink grapefruit. Full bodied with smooth mouthfeel. Really nice one but I think I liked Alter Ego more."
"Look: orange with a white, slightly creamy/frothy head."
Poured from a can brewed on 10/25/16 purchased straight from the brewery and drank that day. 
"Thanks to Pat for sharing this growler, it pours cloudy gold brown color with a foamy 1 finger head that faded slowly, leaving real nice spotty lacing."
"Pours burnt orange with a big two finger head. Nice lacing. Aroma is a light bong water. Taste is apricots,light candy fruit,pineapple,hop bitterness, mango. Exceptional DIPA. Love tree house they only get better."
"Hazy amber, smells like peaches and grapefruit. Tastes like sweet fruits/stonefruit, boozy, a little spicy. Bitterness is present but well balanced. Slightly creamy and nicely carbonated."
"L - Hazy, rusty orange with a finger of white head"
L: Hazy golden orange. Opaque without being murky. Small to medium white head.
10/06 can into a snifter glass. Super hazy orange liquid with a frothy off-white head. Heavy lacing.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass."
Fresh can plus a generous growler from jc1762. Thanks Jon!
"As I always note, I am a huge fan of Tree House."
Look: Opaque hazy burnt orange with a thick white head. 
"Poured a very hazy golden orange color with a good amount of foamy white head. Smells of tropical fruit, mango, and a bit of pine. The flavor is very hop forward, juicy and piney. Very balanced with the malt. Feeling is a little above medium, just a little thick that the look gets you ready for. I can see why this beer is rated so highly. I will definitely seek this one out again!"
"Look: hazy orange, much like a lot of tree house's ipas"
"All that you would expect from Treehouse. Great hop aroma, super balanced, turbid, and very delicious. The aroma was great and the beer was well balanced all around."
Being in Northern NJ I have access to Treehouse brews on a fairly regular basis either through friends or taking the 3 hour trek myself. I've had 80% of the beers they put out and this one is my favorite. I know most people talk up Julius - Haze or Green but to me the difference is how smooth this one is and the depth of flavor here. They are all excellent brews and major east coast hop/juice bombs but Dop is the best for those reasons. One of the best I've had. Superb
Poured from a 750ml bottle into tulip glass nice head that setteled suprisingly quick. Good sticky lacking..color is like a thick orange rusty color 
One of my favorite beers. From a can 8/24 dated. Hazy with tropical fruit smell. Slight bitter juice taste. Orange rind and lemon in there. Overall excellent DIPA. Some similarities to Julius.
"From the 16 oz. can dated Aug 24, 2016. Sampled on Aug 24, 2016. About as fresh as it gets."
Fresh 16oz. can poured into tulip.
"Warning: drunken review, I thought I had already.reviewed this!"
"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with 3/4 inch head. Taste is big oranges, tangerine, and grapefruit rind with peaches. Slightly bitter with dry bitter after taste and medium heavy body. Very juicy. Tastes like a dry hopped beer. Can really taste similarities to Alter Ego and Julius here. I do prefer Haze and Julius, but I think this is my third favorite Tree House beer behind only Haze and Julius. Amazing DIPA and well worth seeking out."
"Poured from growler filled today. Orange-yellow, with generous head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, citrus. Tastes of citrus, bread, lingering well. Feels rich and creamy. Overall a great DIPA, not as overt as offerings from Alchemists but more refined and even."
Poured into a Duvel Tulip. 
"Love this iipa.....let me roll out the adjectives to describe this beer. Murky, dank, earthy, balanced, drinkable, thick, juicy, guava-esque, dangerous, and sexy. Such a unique take on a double....one of the best out there."
Superb.. Period.. Have had a number of treehouse IPAs and boy did this one stand out. Great body full of pure juicy hops with great aroma. Such a stellar beer
Canned 7/21. Consumed 7/30.
"This exceeded my expectations, hence the high scores."
"Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a muddled, opaque, orange-tan coloring, with a foamy, low profile, dense, off-white head. Aromas of orange rind, grapefruit, melon, mango, apricot, wet grass, pine tassels, and moss. Very well balanced, with a slight edge to the fruity notes. Flavors are supersweet fruity notes forward, heavy on melon and mango, with the citrus notes becoming more of a highlight or accent. The end of the palate houses the dank and vegetal hops characteristics, rich in wet grass, pine pitch, and mossy notes. Very well balanced, but still leaning towards the fruity side, which is perfect. The body is big and smooth, with a slick coating that makes it insanely drinkable. The aftertaste is fruit salad, with a kick of dried grass and pepper spice. The finish is smooth, light, and slightly effervesced, with a bitter and dank linger. Great beer!"
"First impressions of a 750mL growler that was filled the day prior (L: 4.5 S: 4 T: 4.5 F: 4.75 O: 4.5, total rating: 4.41): Pours a hazy orange in color with a white head. Aroma is subdued but just shy of dank with some melon, cantaloupe, and pine. At the very end of the glass I'm able to pick up some bready malts. Taste is typical Tree House, lots of melon and cantaloupe. I also get some other indistinct tropical fruits, maybe some papaya. This finishes fairly neutral with little bitterness and only hint of fruity sweetness. Great mouthfeel, very interesting. Smooth and shy of creamy, it is both full and very light on the palate at the same time. Overall a great beer that definitely grew on me. At first I was a bit underwhelmed but the muted aroma and the dominant melon/cantaloupe flavor combination that I get so often from Tree House but this beer won me over. As I continued to savor this over the course of a 750mL growler I found a bit more nuance. This was far too easy to drink for 8.2%."
"This beer tastes like a symphony, it's so balanced. But it's not a perfect score..."
"Vibrant yet opaque dark orange with a very large, off-white, sea foam textured head that persists as a lumpy, fluffy whip cream blanket."
Doppel' is the lightest drinking DIPA I've ever had. Its like drinking a light low-alachol beer as far as body goes. Its tasty and can almost be session'd. Its soooo light.
Again another great IPA from TH! Lives up to all expectations. The reviews say it all. I would like to know if y'all find that the IPAS and DIPAs are bettet poured from can than from a growler/flip top. My fellow TH fans and I usually consume these beers the same day or within 2-3 days and handle them with the utmost care but agree that poured from a can consistently have better flavor.
Might be my favorite Tree House beer. Big fan of Alter Ego and this somehow managed to improve on AE. Explosive hop flavor but so juicy with mango and papaya grapefruit. This was so enjoyable. Some dankness and resin on this bad boy really makes this stand out. Looking forward to getting my hands on more of this
750ml flip top growler into Tree House stemware. Shared with schen9303. 
"Cloudy, dark gold color. Moderate starting head that settles to rim bubbles. Some spots for lace. "
Sweet hoppy juicy greatness
"very close to Trillium's Dialed In. orange juice with vodka! great screwdriver-tasting brew.... super hazy, a tad more bitter than the Trillium edition, but very nice. great brew, super easy to drink and enjoy. not as amazing as Alter Ego but still a really decent brew!!!"
Consumed 6/19/16
Great viscosity for an IPA. Dank and citrus but I actually enjoy alter ego more.
Something odd in the flavor (is it the particular style of hops used?) that disappointed. Came back to it a couple of beers later and it seemed OK. Who knows?
"Easily one of the best they put out, allthough I will admit its all subjective with how people taste and rate this. But personally this is one of my favorites from the guys."
Drank in a Tree House chalice on 6/9/2016
TREE HOUSE DOPPELGANGER DIPA 6/11/16
"The best DIPA I've ever had! Great look, flavor & nose. No boozy taste just big hoppy goodness. All the hype around Tree House is more than justified!! Waited on line for 1.5 hours purchased the limit and absolutely love all three brews that were available. Cheers!"
Thanks to JLindros for sharing. 
Growler filled yesterday.
"Thanks to Bunuelian for this can. He mumbled something about “this beer sucks” when he handed it to me, so I guess we’ll see. 16 oz. can…& now, after spelling doppelganger wrong for all those years as a D&D Dungeon Master (if you know what that means, kudos, fellow geek). Canned 4/29/16."
"Pours a very cloudy golden mango orange color. Aroma is juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor is citrusy and juicy, has notes of papaya and a touch of bitter citrus peel and the back end. Has a nice body with low carbonation. Overall a Felicia juicy IPA."
"Hard to give this a better review for this offering from Tree House than what BEERchitect furnished. The IPA and imperial IPA formula that Tree House is following is clearly a repeatable and exacting process. This is another brilliantly hued and deeply saturated orange peach colored beer with delicate head and fine, spidery lacing on the glass. Massively tropical, all the fruits you'd expect in a beer like this. Mango, pineapple, some kiwi, peach, grapefruit, and lots of nectarine. The bitterness really doesn't appear until the finish, and oh what a sublime experience that is. The mouthfeel is just so unbelievably soft you can forget you're drinking a beer at times. Unlike green and julius this beer does have a touch more pronounced alcohol, and the malt foundation is ever so slightly more caramel and sweet bread imbued. Absolutely amazing and well worth a wait in line with other eager Tree House fans."
Really loved this beer. A ton of hops on the nose and palate with a smooth finish. There aren't many IPAs better than this. Treehouse never ceases to amaze. Get your hands on it if you can
"As every brewery in the sudsy landscape takes their turn at the imperial IPA style, many are content to play along, emulating what others have done. But there are others who won't rest easy until the style is completely reimagined, reinvented, redefined."
Canned on 4/29/16
Poured from 1 pint can.
Pours a hazy deep orange color with a huge fluffy white head. Leaves a ridonkulous amount of clingy lacing. The head retention is equally ridonkulous.
It's a Treehouse how can you go wrong!? If you can get it/try it it's worth it!!!!!!
Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse snifter. Purchased and canned at the brewery the day of release 4/29/16. Consumed same day. 
"This is a great beer. Mosaic isn't my favorite, but unlike Very Hazy (which isn't as good as Haze), this takes Alter Ego to the next level. Not my favorite TH beer, but one of their best hoppy offerings."
"Look - Golden orange type color, completely hazy and turbid "
Enjoyed in a tulip glass
"Every ranked Tree House brew has been absolutely sublime and Doppelganger is no different. It does taste quite similar to Alter Ego with just more of a kick. It is a light orange haze and smells of grapefruit. Tastes of mostly grapefruit, some pineapple, and other tropical fruits. Has the signature soft creaminess that you would expect from Tree House and overall Doppelganger is highly drinkable and clean."
Unbelievable in every way. Juicy mind explosion in a can.
Look: Golden caramel. Not translucent; hazy. Small head with fine bubbles dissipating to a thin rim.
"Another great beer from the Tree House gang. Pours a murky orange color, with huge amounts of tropic fruit on the nose. The taste is similar to the smell, but has a bit of a lingering bitter after taste. Overall this is a good beer, but not my favorite from TH"
"thanks to my brother for sharing this, enjoyed chilled in a willybecker from the can."
"Definite improvement over Alter Ego. Even with a month-old can, aroma bursts out of the glass when pouring. Taste follows - tons of tropical fruit balanced by some slight bitterness and a bit of dankness. Perfect pillowy TH mouthfeel. Doesn't quite reach the heights of Very Hazy, but that's an incredibly high bar to set. Tree House knocked it out of the park again."
I had this in the growler and the can. The growler was the better sample by far. Huge aroma bursting out of the glass. I mean huge. Flavor followed through exactly like the nose. Just huge. Tropical. Soft on the palate does not drink as big as it is. Super clean. Best Double IPA I've ever had.
Alter's older brother. This one was very good. I am a big alter ego fan and this one had nice punch with a smooth finish. I hope they offer this again soon.
Ding ding ding. Another th winner. Pours out a super hazy orange color. Smells like pureed pineapple juice with some other passion fruits mixed in and the taste follows that with the signature juicy fruit bubble gum mouthfeel. This is the 2nd best iipa next to kj. Amazing. And over 2 months old too!
"Purchased straight from Tree House brewery and poured into a snifter with a soft orange color and decent amount of head. If you have had Alter Ego before, the smell is identical (okay... maybe slightly more pungent). The taste is great and is like a better Alter Ego (if there was such a thing). For this style beer, the mouth feel is spot on. Overall, I love Alter Ego so you can imagine how much I enjoyed this one! Cheers!"
"Poured from a can into a teku. Huge juicy, tropical notes balanced by a bit of dankness. Classic TH hazy look and pillowy mouthfeel. Right up there with Juice Machine as my favorite TH beer to date!"
"A: Quite hazy that I quickly liken to the color of peach nectar. Looks like a drink I make for St. Paddy's day actually called the Dublin Peach, which has ginger ale, citrus juice and jameson in it. I didn't get much head or lacing on it. Awesome color blend though."
L: Hazy orange body with a thick faint copper head that retains to a white ring that leaves behind a lot of lacing.
White head with lace. Hazy golden orange.
"Make way, here comes the Melon & passion fruit. Also pulling apricots after the dankness, as well as the signature pillow mouth feel. Alter ego on steroids."
Hype ws real with this one! Tons of juicy citrus hops on both the nose and the palate here! This was a real treat and would love to have it again if it wasn't so impossible to get Treehouse IPAs
Honestly one of the best beers I've ever had. Smooth and easy to drink. Great citrus taste that fills the mouth and leaves you wanting more. Would wait in line for this beer any day.
16 ounce can poured into a snifter.
Another great DIPA from the masters. Reminded me of an IPA with some flavors from Ma. (Canned the same week?)
"Another great DIPA from the folks at Tree House. I think this one is meaningfully better than Alter Ego, which left me wanting a bit. When I drank a freshly poured 750, I was treated to a wonderfully hoppy beer with that characteristic TH ""juiciness"". I can't wait to go back for another."
Team Julius? Team Green? What about Team Ego?
"I made the mistake of drinking this after King Julius...and really, how is anything supposed to follow up King Julius? So my opinion of Doppelganger might be a bit deflated, but it still struck me as a very solid DIPA. You can definitely taste Alter Ego in there, with just a little extra kick to amp things up. It's tasty, but I prefer the aforementioned Julius, as well as Haze and Green over this one."
"Head to head side by side with the King Julius himself, showdown."
"Dank tropical fruit salad. Pineapple, papaya, mangoes, tangerine and peach. light and prickling bitterness. Orange zest. Extremely balanced, never becoming too bitter. Long, lingering dank finish. Very good."
Had from can 10 consecutive days out of curiosity where it's sweet spot was. 7 days was the best.
One of the most bitter and best TH beers
"Pours orange cloudy with a one finger head. Smells dank, citrus and orange. Taste is bitter clean and smooth, citrus and hoppy. Very hoppy. A bit of dry and lingering bitter stays for a bit. It's like a smoother, more aggressively hopped Alter Ego, but I may actually prefer the original in this case. Still a great beer from a great brewery."
"Pours honey colored with tight white head, opaque."
"Another great IPA from tree house. It is super juicy, fruity and smooth as you would expect from these guys. I could drink this thing all day easily. I definitely recommend."
"The color of raw honey. It smells of fresh mango, pineapple, and a sweet bread malt. Almost smells like a pineapple upside down cake. Taste is fresh mango, riney bitterness, slight sweet malt flavor. Bitterness lingers a little too long for me. Typical soft mouth feel for Treehouse accompanied by some lingering alcohol presence. Overall another solid offering."
Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a moderate 1 inch head. Smells of pineapple and mango and orange predominate. Nice smooth tropical taste with a nice malt backbone and a moderate bitter end with a nice alcohol compliment. Very very well done.
L: Brazen golden honeycomb hues beset with a generous fluffy white head
"Poured out as a hazy orange color with a white head on top. There is a wave of hop aromas that fill the air as you fill the glass. The taste of the beer is hoppy, some dank flavors, some subtle tropical notes. The feel is smooth and creamy. Overall another winner from Tree House."
reviewing side by side w alter ego. pours lighter in color w less head. still hazy like all treehouse beers. nose is similar to alter ego but little more concentrated. taste is out of control. front palate is bitter that quickly gives way to a juice bomb w a complete in your face fruit boquet of the tropics. end palate is wonderful finish of fruit that makes me pucker and want more. this beer is a superior alter ego. more flavor. more nose. muey bien. damn treehouse knocked it out of the park. really good. not sure if it's a five. but there isn't much better out there
"A hazy cloudy orange color. The nose is pretty much all earthy fruits without much of a hop presence. The taste is a very creamy pale ale with a good blend of hops, malt and some hints of fruitness. Not a lot of bitterness, the feel is quite full and creamy. Overall a very good Tree House beer."
the look pours out a opaque almost darker orange.. smell is huge dry rind fruits.. amarillo shines through for me.. classic Tree mouthfeel that is exceptional.. taste is fantastic.. one of my fav tree to date..
"16 oz can. Cloudy apricot color with thin white head, good retention little lace. Fruity aroma jumps out, citrusy with dark fruit notes. Juicy TH taste with sweet dark tropical fruit. Back end has very nice bitterness to balance the sweet with a touch of earthy pine. Medium soft silky mouthfeel. Another winner!"
Smells like Mandarin oranges. Very pungent. Taste grapefruit and the back end oranges. Smooth taste. A bit too bitter for my palette but very lovely.
"Purchased at brewery, canned on 1/22. "
Can poured into tulip glass. 1/22/16. Say yes. 
"Here we go again. Awesomeness in a can. Hazy, pungent, sticky. Just damn delicious. For the reviewer that finds it ""hard to drink"", let me be the first to offer to take all of his undrank Dopple off his hands. Wouldn't want a fellow beer- geek to suffer."
"Ridiculously good... but hard to drink. Never said this about a beer, but too much aroma/late addition/dry hop hops. Great beer to share, but when drinking a whole 16oz by myself, would take regular Alter Ego any day. That said, this is still an amazing beer, but it just doesn't meet the deliciously-hoppy-yet-super-drinkableness that I have come to expect from TH"
Canned 1-22-2016
This is my favorite TreeHouse brew so far.
The first perfect score i've given. But holy damn do I love this beer.
"Poured from growler. Hazy orange with a finger head. Solid retention, a light layer of foam sticks throughout. Lacing is strong. Great smell. A balance of earthy pine, and various citrus. Taste is equally as assertive. Orange, some peel, a touch of lemongrass. Very smooth with good carbonation. Hop oils and a full feel. Great beer."
"Pours a hazy orange/yellow color with a thick white head that lingers throughout drinking. Some lacing on the glass. Smell is thick with mosaic, taste reflects the same. Can definitely tell the difference between this and the regular Alter Ego, a tad more boozy but still very well hidden. Extremely smooth, excellent beer"
"Canned 1/22, drank 1/22. This is the highest score i have given to a beer to date.Drank side by side with Julius, sap, mettle, scaled up. This was a clear winner."
"L - deep, dark, glowy, hazy. Darker the deeper into the glass we go. Ripe orange juice. Leaves a sticky, faintly orange-laced head. Color kinda reminds me of when you're making a mess trying to peel an orange and you're left with orangey stained fingers. "
A home run!
Honestly one of the best DIPAs I've ever had.
"02/2015 - I get why this is hyped - it's quite good; but it isn't my favorite Bissell. There's a lot of onion, fruity hops, piney aromas; sweet, tangy, well hopped flavors with some caramel too; a touch bitter, earthy finish, with some melon hanging around back."
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy yellow color. Aroma is grainy with soft fruitiness and a bit floral. Taste is hoppy, juicy and grassy with a dry and bitter finish. Overall it's a juicy but also dry, west coast-ish IPA."
While this is a great beer I actually prefer Substance and Reciprocal. Lux is interesting in its own right since its a rye beer. Perhaps Swish is higher rated since it is so much harder to get. Regardless Bissell Brothers are making some great beers.
"Been a couple years since I last tried Swish, it was too astringent then, but it tastes damn close to perfect now. Starting from the back, there's a balanced citrus bitter finish. Moderate dankness and a hint of savory vegetable with the juicy fruit punch. The aroma is more floral, but still backed by big fruity hops. Lots and lots of delicious, well balanced hops."
"OK, this stuff is amazing. Pours a shade of gold that immediately lets you know you're in for a treat. Smell is actually fairly mild compared to how rich in flavor it is, with notes of general dankness, and some sweet fruitiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Mouthfeel is incredible, it's somehow smooth AND substantial. The flavor lands on your tongue with a bang, then leaves slowly, and gradually, as if it was melting, but wanted to take its time. One of the best beers I've ever had."
Mosaic really comes through well. Eerily similar to Treehouse Doppleganger
A - Pours golden orange with a one finger foamy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.
Pint can (3/23/18) poured into a fat Duvel tulip glass on 3/30/18
Straw appearance that is very cloudy with significant white head that disipates slowly. Aroma is a hoppy with some citrus. Taste is a hoppy dominated citrus that would be better with a little less hoppyness.
"Dank and fruity. Extremely aromatic. Really chewy and rich, but a touch heavy bitter in the finish. Fully bodied."
Pouring a cold 16 oz can into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a small bleached white creamy head of 1.5 cm. The foam slowly fades to a thick edge layer and a wispy surface island. 
"Hazy and dark gold in color. Two finger head and off white in color. Smells of pine, resin and tropical fruit. Loads of tropical fruit flavor. I want to say Hawaiian Punch without the sugar sweetness with pine and resin. There's some hops but not much and a little spice on the tongue. It's medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation."
Pours a yellow orange color with a 1/2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Big juicy citrus aroma. Mild piney resin. Big juicy citrus taste up front with a surprisingly bitter piney resin at the end. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very good beer.
Canned 4 days ago.
"IMHO, one of the top 5 NEIPA's available."
I was totally blown away by this beer. I’ve been searching for it for quite some time.everytthing about this beer is I credible.
Just the best NE IPA I've had in a long time. Legitimately rivals the best Tree House beers.
"After hearing all the hype about this brewery, finally had a chance to taste a couple of their offerings. Unbelievable citrus once can was cracked. Leaves a ton of melon on the palate. Like Substance, extremely drinkable. Looks like those horrible NEIPAs that taste like grapefruit juice but tastes much cleaner. Can't say I'd ever wait 2 hours for it but still good."
"Waited 1 and 3/4 hours in 17 degree temp for this. Got a case. Not bad, but not sure it's worth the hype. Don't get me wrong, it's a great NE IPA, but I won't be waiting in line again."
"Wow , just wow .... great beer"
Incredible bear
"Fresh can into an IPA glass - turbid chicken stock with a billowing head, hop blast - citrus, cut grass, mango, some bitterness for balance, soft and creamy - a gem. A perfect 12/12"
finally drinking this for the first time. pours out a glowing pineapple juice color with bright white head that leaves excellent lacing. 
"Pours a hazy pale orange in color with nearly 2 fingers of white head. Love the aroma, I get melon, cantaloupe, mango, and lots of smooth tropical fruits. Tastes great, mirrors the aroma but leans more towards the tropical fruit notes. Medium-light body and moderate carbonation. This is strikes a great balance. The mouthfeel is great, it's wonderfully tropical. I'm not upset that I waited in line for the first release of the season, I very much enjoyed this beer as did my fiancé."
"Absolutely worth the hype on this one - absolutely fantastic NE DIPA all around. Perfect feel, flavor, balance."
"Solid offering from Bissell, but does not come close to Tree House. It lacks dimensions and creaminess. Yellow pale murkiness with white head. Citrus and lemon grass. Only hints of tropics. Falls flat and monotone on the feel and flavor. All things considered, my palate has become very critical and only compare it to the best that I have had. I would drink this everyday if I could, but for a special occasion there are some better beers out there."
"Tasted from can. Pours a super murky pale yellow with thick white head. Aroma is citrusy with lots of lemon some tropical fruits and grassy aromas. Super well balanced taste. Passionfruit, pineapple, lemon, melon, biscuits, caramel. Awesome IPA that doesn't get much better than this."
Best beer I have ever had.
Excellent DIPA perfect for post skiing and really any occasion. World class beer and brewery
"Thanks Blue_Rogue. This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a glazed over yellow/slight orange color. The head dissipated immediately. Light lacing stuck only around the glass. The smell had a wonderful sweet to lightly spiced combination of raw piney and grapefruit. Adequately enthralled with the substance of the bitter sweet citrus hops, a light burst of sweet onion runs into the aroma and blends wonderfully. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and amplifies to flavor. There’s no aftertaste nor finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation hits like a good DIPA should but still isn’t overbearing. A lingering semi - soft bitter dryness rolls over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a very good DIPA that I would love to have again."
"Hazy gold color, subtle nose with pleasant hints of fruit and a nice followed by powerful fruit flavors and a balanced bitter backbone. Good mouth feel and a long finish."
"Can date hard to read, looks like May 7. Poured into Teku glass."
great haze. light golden look. what makes this NE IPA unique is the spicy finish. I haven't had a finish like this before and it was definitely unique and enjoyable. fruit notes are subtle compared to other NE IPAs.
Swish has a pretty good reputation in these parts as Bissell Bros. Best beer. I Don't think its their best. I think It's solid though. Its one of the better citra based NEipa's. Its smooth and has loads of cirtus wile finishing tart. A good beer and one of the best to display citra as its main ingredient.
Fabulous DIPA! It is always fresh as it does not last long when it is released (you will be sorry if you miss it).
Canned a week and a half ago. 
"Juice bomb. One of my new favorite and most sought after beers. This brew is PUNCTUAL! As juicy as this beer is, it's still incredibly well balanced with enough bite to off set, finishes clean. Smooth from front to back with a beautiful aftertaste that left me smacking my lips. Can't wait to get my hands on more."
Update:
"Mimosa yellow, some foam."
"This was delicious. Incredibly hazy which is saying something having had several Trillium and Tree House. Mosaic is just hop bae at this point, can't wait to get my hands on more of this."
"No date on the can but was purchased on their 3/22 release. Poured into my TH Teku. Murky faded orange juice with a modest head, pour was not aggressive. The smell out of the can was a little more pleasant that out of the glass. Got a little more of an apricot smell at first but then had hints of onion and sweat. Found this to have a bit of an ashy flavor, not unpleasant surprisingly enough. Also some hints of onion in there. Still had a juicy feel and carbonation was spot on. Definitely a fan of this beer! Nice balance and distinct flavor."
"East coast versus west coast, versus midwest, versus New England... Can't we all just get along? The brewers of Bissel Brothers certainly think so with a slam dunk rather than a swish. Bitter but balanced. Smooth but with a bite. Fruity but dry- Swish does it all."
Wicked good with a sweet finish.
On tap at the King's Head in Portland (Maine) today.
"As far as DIPAs go, this one is good but not great. I was lucky to have one fresh (less than two weeks old) and was really looking forward to tear into it."
Got my first one thanks to a great trade.
"Pours a hazy, turbid bright yellow almost wit like. Nosh is fresh! Fresh citrus, fresh topical notes, fresh doughy yeast. Taste of ""juicy"" Orange and mangos. A bit of grapefruit rind and a light sweet dough and yeast to it. Medium bodied, dry and semi crisp to finish. Very tasty brew!"
"It has elements of a kolsch, wit, and hefeweizen. I wonder if I’m tasting a mixture of this beer and whatever was on before it was tapped. I love it though"
"From a 16oz can, undated but purchased at the brewery when released on 03/23/17. Served in an imperial pint glass."
16 oz can gifted by a friend. How did I not know about this one!?!
"Pours an opaque hazy gold with one and half finger head that reduces to a halo and some film, nice lacing."
"Finally made it up to Portland for some Swish and am NOT disappointed! Phenomenal beer. My sinuses are terrible in the winter and the citrus just punched right through to me. Taste is right on par. Juicy beer, really enjoying it. If you haven't been, make the trip. Great atmosphere and great people. Everyone's happy when they're drinking good beer!"
"Thanks go to Ovaltine for this one, as part of NBS BIF#5. 16oz can poured into 12oz flared goblet. Poured an opaque orange-yellow color with just a cap of white head that dissipated moderately and left no lace."
"Look, feel and taste is world class. That great mouth feel with an unforgettable fruity aftertaste that you won't find anywhere else. Could use a little more aroma but I can't complain. One of 3 best NEipa in New England thus far. Keep up the great work guys."
The best. Nothing else to say here.
"Bright golden orange, off white head, haze and tons of lacing. Fruity hop soaked aromas. Notes of pineapple candy, mango flesh, grapefruit pulp, oyster cracker, and citrus peel. Thinner side of medium, crisp, dry and very crushable. Super solid hazy DIPA with big fruit flavor."
This one pours a hazy color that invokes egg yolks mixed with pulpy orange juice- it looks strangely appealing even though it shouldn't.
"It's definitely good, just didn't live up to the hype for me. Pale yellow/straw color smells mostly of pineapple. Taste and feel are good, not ""blow my nips off"" great. Still mostly pineapple, smooth feel and the 8% goes unnoticed."
As good as it gets for hazy flavorful IPAs.
"My first beer from these guys, I held this a couple of days to let the anticipation build. I can hold out no longer. "
"Pouts a hazy yellow with a foamy white head that dissipated quickly with little lacing. Aroma is fruit, pineapple, mango, peach, very tropical. Taste matches the aromas, very juicy but there is a darkness to as well. Very light carbonation and a nice medium mouthfeel with a sort of creaminess to it. Really perfect ale."
"This one didn't live up to the hype for me. Not saying it is bad, just not as advertised. Thin body, not a ton of hop flavor. It underwhelmed me, as I would call this a pale ale, maybe an IPA, but I would have never guessed that this is a DIPA. Weird. Good beer, but not as advertised."
Poured from the can into a taster. Hazy looking pour with dank pineapple notes on the nose. Taste follows through with tropical fruit balanced nicely. Very well done.
What a great beer. Lot of bitter and sweet at the same time. Smells like a trillium. Leaves a hint of bitter aftertaste. Different from the other bissel offerings; better. I wish this was easier to get.
My first beer from Bissell Brothers. Poured from a 16 oz can (no date) into a tulip glass.
"16oz can served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy lemon orange body with a one finger thick frothy white head, great retention, lots of rings of lacing. Smell is rich citrus, grapefruit and orange; light zest on top of a mild amount of caramel and minimal sugar sweetness. Awesome. The nose just bursts with aroma, this is what makes a NE IPA what it is, not the haziness. Flavour follows, rich citrus and grapefruit, mild sweetness from the grain, but overall mostly fruit-forward with a nice balance with the dextrin/sugar malt sweetness and the mild resinous bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, appropriately carbonated and just altogether too good to put the glass down for any extended period of time. Very good NE double IPA, one of the best representations of the style."
"Look:Hazy, yellow, opaque with a small lingering head."
"Hazy murky golden pour, good sized head, thick ring of lace. Dank aroma and taste, weed, peach, mango, subtle malt sweetness. Dry finish. Excellent."
"Canned ten days ago, and I'm excited as hell to review Swish. I've had several cans before, but I've never reviewed it, and never this fresh. I'm letting it warm just slightly after taking out from the fridge, as I do with all quality IPAs. "
"Canned a week ago, it's got a classic New England look: completely cloudy piss yellow color and a foamy 1-2 finger foamy white head that faded very very slowly and left really nice spotty lacing and rings as it went down."
"From 16oz can into tulip. Pours a beautiful soft orange lemonade, with a minimal, but nice white head composed of larger than average bubbles. Nice ring remains around the circumference when the head dissipates. "
"Best beer I've had in al long time. citrus tropical smell and taste seemed to overwhelm the palate. In a good way. This DIPA is not overrated . One of the best I've ever had. Also, Love the grapefruit juice straw color and a solid mouth feel."
Look: murky/OJ
"Canned today 1/14/16. Pours merky as hell ( looks like piss in a cup) Cloudy orangina. Very light lacing. Aroma is pineapple, tangerine mango,citrus. Taste. Boom!! Juice bomb baby. It follows the nose with fresh peach, citrus hops, Carmel, light gram cracker with a light dank finish. Very complex on flavors yet smooth transitions. Exceptional DIPA lives up to the hype. Look forward to more from them. Big fan of bissell brothers."
"Hazy straw with a peach-tinted, foamy head. Bubbles are thick and soapy. Smells like peaches and mango, a little grapefruit, candy orange. Tastes like peach and mango! Tropical and fruity with rind bitterness - perfect balance. Breath tastes like bubblegum after you swallow. Fizzy and creamy on the back."
Drank 04-01-16.
"wow. just wow. on tap at the brewery, crazy looking ice cream head, milky yellow murk, smell is huge tropical fruits and grass, taste is even bigger tropical fruits and grassy hops. feel is perfect, this is one of the best beers i've ever had. again: wow. just wow."
This is one that def lived up to the hype. My 2nd favorite from BB behind only Nothing Gold. Just as juicy/tasty as I expected. It took awhile to get some but was well worth the effort. Excellent brew.
"Giving this a 4.5 as an average, as I've had this three times now and the first two times it was amazing. But this 12/22 batch of Swish is not the same as usual. It's got different flavor than previous batches imo. Slight let down after a sub-zero, pre dawn line! :) Still love Bissell Beers! The Substance is better and better every time."
"Had some maine friends pick up this beer on 12/22. Did a taste test on Christmas day with 3 other friends/relatives. Tree House Green, Lawson's Sip of Sunshine and New England Brewing's Coriolis. Swish did not win. Looks like a cloudy orange juice on the pour. Has the citrus smell at first grapefruit then more mango. Has a good taste but the finish is not my style more pine I guess? An excellent beer not the best I have had from Maine."
"One of the best iipas ive ever had. Best enjoyed slowly, even though the citrus taste makes the sluggability factor almost impossible to ignore."
The beer pours nicely with a bright yellow custard color and white head. The head dissipates quickly with very little lacing.
It's all that and a bag of donuts.
Big thanks Doug537 for this
It's worth the drive
5oz pour from the brewery in Portland
Picked up fresh from brewery. Excellent job on this beer. Pours a dense orange without being cloudy. Nice combination of fruity zest and piney elements. Well done Bissell Brothers!
Golden cloudy beautiful fluffy IPA taste. Probably the best bissell brothers beer I have had from them. Very fruity and piney. Definitely crushable IPA. Very strong.
Can received in trade with Jacob. Thanks!
Canned 11/12/16. Consumed 11/19/16.
Reminded me a good bit of Ram-Schaumburg Juicy. Citrus-orange taste with a mild malt backbone that's easy to drink. Very solid.
Opaque solid yellow with a moderate foamy white head leaving a little spotty lace.
Service:Can
"Tested better than Green and Melcher St, by a mile. Thought it was hype- it was not- Bissell's Nothing's Gold and Swish are two of the best!"
Straw to pale gold in color and cloudy/opaque with little head that settles to nearly nothing. No lacing present.
"Just to say beforehand, This was the first beer release that I attended in Out of state, or even im Maine. It was about a 2 hour drive, 3 hour wait in line, and a 2 hour drive back home. But very much worth it."
Super hazy orange yellow. 
16 oz can.
L - Bissell Brothers trademark hazy pour
Best IPA I've had.
"Nice unfiltered look - color or grapefruit juice. BIG mango/guava/passion fruit nose that exploded out of the can. Tropical taste but finished with a bit of grapefruit and then a nice slight bitter hops bite. Significant carbonation makes for a significantly different mouth feel from Haze or Julius. Bottom line - this is a world class brew. Every New England IPA lover should grab a few. Personal taste, I prefer the Tree House mouth feel, but I definitely want to see this one on my beer fridge again."
"Flat out amazing beer! I need more of this well balanced, hop smash!"
"Best beer I have had. Was fortunate enough to have Julius, double dry hopped Scaled, Roosevelt, and Swish this last week. Swish has the best balance of smell, juicy citrusy hoppy taste with just enough bitterness to remind you it's an IPA and the trademark New England hazy OJ look. Love this beer. Perhaps my all time favorite. Thanks BB."
Truly fantastic. Had never heard of his beer or the brewery before going to Portland for a night. Glad I was told about it and was there on a release day. Sad that I only had $20 cash so couldn't get more (the credit line was long). After drinking my last one I definitely want to make a return trip to Portland to get more of this.
"Pours a cloudy mango color. Aroma is juicy hops with lots of tropical fruit. Notes of papaya, mango and citrus. Flavor follows the nose, lots of tropical fruit and citrus with a touch of bitterness in the back end. Mouthfeel is nice and juicy but has a little sharpness from the carbonation. Overall this was absolutely delicious."
"It's like a dank cloud from heaven in a can, or in a keg."
"This beer pours a super cloudy golden yellow color with a 2 finger bright white head that fades to 1/4 inch ring around the edge with a microfilm layer across the top. There are sticky chunks of hanging lacing. Smell is citrus, tropical and green dankness. Grapefruit, orange, pithy citrus, mango, pineapple and dankness burst out of the glass. Taste is the same, simply fantastic. Feel is light and juicy, but has a sticky resinous finish. Cannot believe this is 8%. Overall this beer is amazing. Like more resinous, citrus, and slightly more dank version of Alter Ego. Just fantastic. Also has a similar hop profile to Billy Full Stack in my opinion."
Thanks for the hookup Mike! 2 weeks old!
"Very nice murky orange pour, nice foamy sticky looking head with excellent lacing and retention."
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with a nice white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit, with little hop smell. Taste is similar to smell, but with a nice hoppy bitterness that bites a bit, just enough to keep things interesting. Nicely carbonated and good mouthfeel. A really really good NE IPA."
"Murky, hazy, orange pineapple juice pour. Aroma and taste of pineapple, overripe guava, kiwi, ..tropical fruit mixed with acidic fruit. Doesn't have that sorbet, orange, banana, mango, non-acidic-fruit balance to smooth it out and soften it up. Mouthfeel is nice regardless with a pungent coating that ends with some green tea. Punchy hops sock you in the pie hole - imbalanced and aggressive. Looks/feels unstructured in appearance and taste. Would like more of a malt foundation with a stronger bitter finish to help mellow out the hops. As far as hop-forward IPAs go - this is it."
"Pours a hazy pastel orange color. Melon, grapefruit, mango, and lemon dominate the nose. Low hop presence. Taste follows.....juicy with medium to low bitterness. Low carbonation with medium feel. Another great NE ipa."
"4/15/18 Edit: The current version of this beer does not even remotely resemble the dank, hoppy version I rated the last time. It is a milky, chalky, fruity mess that I had about 3 drinks of before dumping. Not sure why they even bothered to change a world class beer that people lined up for, but this warrants a new name. Current rating 3.25"
"Nothing bad to say about this one very smooth, great taste, notes, fruity but not over bearing, pours great and thick head highly recommended."
"Insane. Beautiful haze, not too crazy but haze. Love the citrusy, stone fruity, deep flavor. Very impressive aromas, good dry hop mouthfeel. Damn sad I only have one can of this."
Appearance- hazy yellow/pale orange. Light carbonation with nice glass lacing
Pours a extremely hazy golden yellow color with a deep orange hue. The typical haze for dayz appearance on this NE IPA.
Idk how this isn't rated higher it's awesome
"Light, juicy, creamy all in one. Citrus all the way, but a great balance and not just a citra bomb. The combo of the flavor with the depth is damn near perfected. First Bissell experience. Thanks!"
Top 5 IPA!
canned 3/19/16
"This is super juicy. I could smell the citrus as it poured. Very murky, just the way i like it. Taste follows, citrus, tons of citrus. Mango, orange, pineapple. Not overly hopped bitterness. I really like this one."
"This is a wonderful DIPA, up there with Tree House IPAs as some of the best I've been lucky enough to try. Get it fresh, drink it cold, and enjoy."
"Canned on date of either 3/22 or 3/23, I don't recall which."
Can dated 3/22. Walked away with 5 4-packs (4 for me). Definitely worth the hype. Stands up to the other New England DIPA's. Super juicy. Love the creamy mouthfeel and smooth finish. Still have 3 of the 4-packs left so going to be a great next couple weeks.
A: Thick hazy straw colored body with fluffy white foam. Not much lacing
Pours a hazy golden hue with off white head. It's very hazy. The aroma bursts out as it's poured. There's plenty of tropical fruit and citrus. The finish leaves a touch of sticky resin. It's super soft. This is Bissell's gem.
Canned 3/23. Drank from a snifter.
"16 oz can. Pours cloudy yellow orange, two finger white head fades slowly, lots of lace. Big juicy aroma with a dank ness to it. This brew is a juice bomb, tons of citrus and pineapple dominate the taste, balanced with a light malt sweetness. There's an earthy undertone beneath the citrus that adds another layer. Mouthfeel is exceptionally soft. This is a top notch IPA, one of the best out there. Will be seeking out more soon."
"Enjoyed at the brewery Winter 2016. Update: Canned on 2/15/17. Enjoyed on 2/20/17. Acquired in a shady trade at Treehouse. The first time I had this beer at the original brewery, on draft, perfect 5.0 beer. It was different. A can from idk when in a shady deal, 4.6/5.0."
"Wow. Another stellar ne iipa. Pours out a hazy light orange color. Smells and tastes of all kinds of delicious passion fruit (mostly pineapple, oranges, mango) and maybe even a little grapefruit in there. Killer mouthfeel that rivals th and trillium. So good."
This was probably my favorite beer I have ever had. Extremely hazy and light orange appearance. Smells like tropical fruit and orange juice. The taste is so smooth and juicy. This is very similar to Julius but I seemed to enjoy this one a little more.
"Beautiful hazy pour, outrageously fruity nose. I got a ton of tropical notes out of it, like mango, guava, and passionfruit. Definitely one of the best IPAs I've had."
"Wow. Bissell Brothers' bolder sibling to the amazing Substance, Swish is bliss. Hazy banana color in the glass, pineapple and citrus aroma, and a big drinkable flavor. BB make IPAs that are completely unique in my experience. If I want a big juicy IPA, I have options. If I want a bitter piney IPA, I have options. There's no substitute for Bissell Brothers' flavor profile. Crisp, dry, pineapply, robust, smooth... It is not my favorite flavor profile, but I have never had an IPA better than Swish."
Fresh can (new black one) poured into a snifter. The aromas reminded me a fruit smoothie with hops added. It pours cloudy orange and looks like mango/orange juice. The taste follows suit with a bunch of tropical fruit and citrus flavors. This is extremely drinkable with medium carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Well done Bissell Brothers! Cheers!
"FanFUKintastic. Pours like OJ, Looks like OJ, goes down like OJ, Delicious citrus bomb that should be considered amongst the best DIPAs in the country."
"World class beer, but has to be had as fresh as possible due to rapid fall off. It reminds me a lot of Tree House Green when super fresh."
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Thank you Joel for trading this to me! About 2 weeks old.
"16oz can courtesy of BabyTree, thanks man! Super hazy orange, good head, good lacing. Aroma is mostly citrus, bits of pineapple. Flavor has some malt which I was not expecting and then a really good citrusy hoppiness. Nice and juicy."
Poured out 16 oz can into Teku Glass
"From can. A pale cloudy orange. Almost milky. Thin head but keeps well. Good lacing. Nice hoppy smell. Good mosaic presence. Hint of peel in the nose. Juicy. Something in the orange family, grapefruit, bit of lemon, then a touch of watermelon. Strong carb. Sticky and a bit resiny. Great beer."
In a tulip glass from a 16 oz. can bought at the brewery dated 02/23.
Super hazy with an orange yellow color
People have been raving about this since I moved to Maine. I finally stopped on lunch and picked up some four packs. Well worth the wait. I can't wait to get out of work to have a few more!
1st rating ....not sure why a score of 85 from the bros but they are full of
16oz can from the brewery. 
Fruitier smell than taste and but effervescent on the feel.
My all time favorite
"Finally picked some of these up in a trade and they lived up to the hype for sure. A juice bomb that hangs with the best NE IPAs. Pours a beautiful hazy orange. Aroma is pure juice - orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and taste is exactly the same with just a bit of pine on the end. Creamy, juicy and smooth - this is a winner."
Tropical citrus notes. Light sweetness in the aftertaste makes this distinct from other juicy offerings. Definitely one of the best DIPAs out there. Lives up to hype. Drank 2/14/16
This is hands down the best IIPA i have ever had. I did a taste test side by side with a heady topper and found this to be far superior IMHO
"I was fortunate to get my hands on Swish from Bissell Brothers via a trade and I drank it last night. I poured it in a beer mug, which was the only clean beer glass I had left last night. What a wonderful IPA!"
L - Murky light orange with barely and head.
"A – 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. Typical BB style - very, very hazy giving an appearance of pineapple juice. Don’t be turned off…there’s much more to this beer than the look. Slight head upon pour which sags. Minor lacing."
Finally got my hands on this. Just what I expected. Amazing nose and mouthfeel. Doesn't drink like 8 percent. I can't wait to go up to Portland and get some for myself.
"So overall for all those that are seeking this beer there is something that you have to take into account- the new black can. The black van means this is the titties and it's so dang good and man it's an absolute no brainer. So juicy, good, and crushable"
Canned 01/15/16.
Canned on 1/26/16; drank in a teku glass on 1/29/16
A: Pours an extremely hazy yellow-orange color with 2 fingers of head that slowly fades down to a thin cap that leaves some good lacing
Incredibly hazy brew; murky orange color.
Waited in line for a little over an hour and it was worth it. Not the most beautiful beer to look at.. murky with lots of junk floating in it but the smell and taste are fantastic lots of tropical notes on the nose and tongue. Thicker mouthfeel for an IPA but not over the top. definitely seek it out.
Fantastic. Absolutely Fantastic.
"Hazy. Dank. Not bitter at all. Tropical and resinous without the bite. The nose explodes when the can is cracked, then the first sip is all grapefruit and cannabis."
"Bissel Brothers Brewing. ...knows what they're doing. They make good beer. I stop there every time I trek up to Maine on a craft beer pilgrimage. I haven't tried as many batches of Swish as I have of The Substance, but I have had a few. I have not been disappointed. Very nice, hazy, hoppy, fruity IPA. Not much else to say."
Single tallboy can from last weekend's Portland haul. 
"I'll admit, I'm not big on the super cloudy look. This one is very hazy with almost a sediment look. It doesn't affect smell or taste though. Smell is very piney, a bit on the dank side. Taste is a fruit bomb on the front end, mango, papaya, even a bit of pineapple followed by a nice pine sharpness. Not overpowering, but there is a slight bitterness, which was great to cut through the citrus. I really enjoyed this."
"Nice combo of fruit plus pine and earthy notes. I get grapefruit, papaya, passion fruit, and mango along with honey and green tea. Pine comes through on the finish. Dank with full mouth feel. I like the complexity and flavor on this."
Poured into a pint glass-
Canned 1 week ago.
Can into tulip glass. 1/2/16
16 ounce can poured into a snifter.
poured from can. super bright mango and pineapple nose. pine and cut grass notes. very hazy yellow. medium carbonation. great mouthfeel. my first bissell bros scored in a trade.
Life changing.
really good IIPA here.. pours the NE hazy yellow.. smells of all citrus fruits... taste is solid.. a slightly more bitter than i like.. mouthfeel is light medium.. a step down from TH-Trill-HF iPAs but world class...
"L: golden,thick,bright"
"16 oz. can. Very hazy pale orange. Distinctive Bissell Brothers aroma. Nice citrus hop aroma. Grainy malt profile. Bright orange hops. Light sweetness. Distinctive Bissell yeast. Mineral and grainy finish. A little astringent and boozy. Very good, though."
"picked it up recently. BB does awesome releases (free gourmet coffee and donuts), lines moves super fast. "
Pours a cloudy dark-ish orange from the can. Looks like orange juice with lots of pulp. Really good tropical fruit nose with a little bit of pine. The body is nice and juicy with a well balanced soft bitterness making an extremely delicious IPA/
Id like to report Jason for his review please.
Pours a hazey yellow with nice foamy head. Lots of hop aroma when you crack open the can. Medium to high carbonation with the flavor of peach and the bitterness or lemon peal. By far my favorite B.B. So far.
L: Hazy with nice lacing - mango and peach flesh hues with moderate lacing
Look - Pineapple juice in the glass. That killer New England look that I have come to love. 
"Picked up a the BBHQ on 12/4 (with about 200 others in line). The beer had been recommended to me and did not disappoint. The coloration is light orange and magnificent and the taste is both tremendous and unique. Extremely smooth and no trace of the 8%. Hops and a hint of fruit flavor that strikes me a grapefruit. I'd doesn't taste like HT or SOS but I'd put it right up there with them, if not above. Everyone I've shared a can with has been blown away. I'm trying to save a few 4 packs as xmas presents but fear I'll have nothing left to give in 10 days..."
"Can. Poured so damn hazily. Looked like peach juice. The aroma was fantastic! What a unique, expressive hop aroma. Puréed fruit-hops. I marveled at this strawberry and kiwi aroma that I kept getting. Not sure that I've came across a scent like that and I'm the town bike when it comes to hoppy beers. The flavor also brings forth that awesome, wacky strawberry and kiwi flavor. There is also a ton of peach, nectarine, pineapple and citrus fruits. It finishes with some drying, grainy malt. Not overly bitter. Creamy mouthfeel. Really one hell of a beer. I love Bissell beers but this one was easily the best. I'd put this up against any hoppy beer I have had in recent memory; maybe ever. There is no reason why an 8% beer should drink this easily and willingly."
"Released Dec. 5, 2015, enjoyed Dec. 9, 2015."
"thanks blessedbebeer, Gary is the man!!! super fresh and super drinkable ipa. just easy drinking w a great flavor and feel. nice citric punch. love this one."
L: a peachy white
"Had on tap at the brewery, also got to bring home a few cans. It has a very light yellow hazy color, but big frothy head with a nice aroma of crisp pine and citrus. The mouthfeel is light and bitter in the best kindof way. There is big flavor here of classic New England IPA pine and grapefruit/orange citrus and this beer goes down smooth. It feels like you could drink 10 of these and not feel full. I don't really know the best way to describe this beer except that it's a carnival for your tastebuds but its light weight and bitterness never make you're stomach feel full... Dangerous, if you could only get your hands on more."
Draft poured at the brewery 
Exceptional. Hops all the way through.
16oz. can into a Grrrz teku. 
"No date on can, not sure how fresh it is. Pours a golden hay color and is very opaque. Typical hop and fruit juice aroma that so many of these NE beers have. Incredible beer, tasted very fresh even though I don't have a date."
L - Orange juice! Not many beers look this good. I'm thinking only Tree House can top this!
16 oz. can from the source poured into a snifter 2 days after canning.
"Some people are turned off by cloudy unfiltered IPAs. Not me. I love the look of this beer. Huge hop bomb, in smell and taste. Almost like a beer fruit juice, in the best way. I didn't like this one quite as much as Substance, but it was still excellent. These guys rock."
"A: Looks amazing. Super hazy, almost grapefruit juice color with a one finger bone white head. "
Thanks to rudzud.
Hop and juice bomb! The look of this beer is also pretty amazing with a glowing orange/yellow integrated haze. The flavor is strong yet nimble with no lasting bitterness on the palate. Awesome beer.
YES!!!! The nose on this beer - so wonderful - so malty sweet and then boom excellent hop bitterness. Notes of huge pineapple and earth and dankness. Huge huge huge fan of this one. The look of this beer is quite yellow/strawy/hazy not my favorite look but everything else is pretty much perfect.
"This is an amazing beer. The color looks like peach/pineapple juice. The nose is like a dozen pineapples in a room having an orgy. Body is full of fruity ""unfilteredness"". Finish is crisp and refreshing. If your trying to get laid drink this."
"L- Dirty, hazy light orange. Just the way I like 'em."
"Pours golden yellow with strong carbonation and a one finger head. Smell is of sticky hop aroma, sweet malts, pineapple and grapefruit citrus. Taste is a citrus wave, with crisp hops, biscuity malts -- with solid bitterness through. Some sweetness stands out as the beer warms up. Still hop forward. Finishes dry and bitter, with a sweet lacing. Overall - really great IPA out of Maine. There's some stiff competition and this beer has to be mentioned when discussing the best."
A very nice beer. Loved it.
16oz can poured into a nonic
Didn't live up to the hype to say the least.
TL;DR: Get it if you can!
"This beer is right up there with Heady Topper. Citrus bomb (tangerine, mango, pineapple,orange, etc.) with a bursting pine/dank hoppy finish! No dryness to it and it goes down smooth and often (as it's too good not to finish!)"
"5/10, canned on 4/3, served in a stemless wine glass"
Poured it into a glass.
Poured from a can into a tulip 
From 04/19/15 notes. 16 oz. can poured into a pint glass. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for giving me this as a wedding present; thanks Ross!
Solid northeast ipa that has a lot of the same flavors as Heady and Alchemist beers. Solid dry hop smell up front and a smooth finish. Definitely not dissociated with this one.
"Very good DIPA, very smooth and balanced perfectly"
Definitely one of those Maine beers that gets the regional quarter bump in points from the homers to elevate its trade status. Good in its own right but not holding its own against the heavyweights of the Northeast. It is difficult to believe that people line up for this beer. 
"Had this on 2015-04-27 in Columbia, PA from a fresh 16 oz can."
One of my favorite beers.
"Pours a hazy, orange-juice color with a decent white head. Leaves an OK amount of lacing. "
"Drank on tap at The King's Head, Portland, ME"
A: Golden Cloudy
"Very similar to Maine ""dinner"" and totally worth seeking out. Had at both brewery and Novare Res in Portland. Beers like this are what it's all about."
So crushable its scary. Too bad its seasonal! Unbelievably smooth ride and hoppy with no bitterness. My absolute favorite double.
The dip is fresh and full of flavor nothing to crazy 3very other beer I've had is a much higher quality/flavor etc
Another great DIPA this beer smells great one of my favorites!!!!
"Great smell, great taste, just the finish was a little boring.... Absolutely a great beer but if we're splitting hairs the finish just didn't hold strong for me"
Not sure how this received that great of a rating.
"Hazy color, juicy, orange juice look, big hops on the nose. Love the sticky resin finish. The best IPA I have ever had. Bissell is doing some good shit!"
Light orange pour with a small head that quickly fades to a thin ring. Robust aroma. Fruity citrus flavor with lingering pine resin. Moderate bitter bite in the finish. Fresh dank hops with medium body and slightly viscous feeling on the palate. An incredible brew unsurpassed.
"16 oz can poured into a bulbed pint glass. Liquid comes out a nice golden yellow color. Glows a little brighter when it's held up to the light. Nice white colored head, mostly small bubbles and it has some decentnlacing to it. "
"Damn! These guys can do no wrong. Explosion of fruit flavors and literally no alcohol taste. Dank, resinous, wonderful balance of bitter with fruit juice and pine. I love Substance but somehow this is just so much better and that is saying a lot! Keep up the KILLER work, fellas!"
"Love this beer, great use of hops"
Absolutely phenomenal. Favorite Beer hands down.
Enjoyed at Black Birch
"I feel like this beer is right out of the Alchemist playbook. Drinks easy, lots of grapefruit and the hop combo is tried and true. Clean finish, and it just feels good. You can't ask for much more out of an IPA."
Straight up mango juice. Yum.
This is amazing. I only have three left and I may cry when it's gone.
"A - Pours a hazy juicy looking golden orange with half a finger of dense near white hwad. Decent retention, some thin lacing sticks to the glass. "
"Half-pint on tap at Hella Good in Portland, Maine. Served in a mason jar."
"Excellent beer. Doesn't take like 8%. Different smell, but you can tell it's going to be good."
"I tried this one tonight for the first time and I was psyched based on all the glowing reviews. In fact I thought I was going to drink a beer that would knock me on my ass. What I had was a very solid DIPA that looked, smelled, and tasted great. It's not too far behind, but I don't think this beer quite stands up to the elite beers coming out of the Northeast right now."
"I feel like I've given too many fives, so I've been trying to find some fault with beers, but there's honestly nothing I could think of that would improve this beer from where it already is. "
16 oz can poured into Speigelau glass
"This beer explodes up front with guava, tropical fruit, and passion fruit. Lots of citrus peel, a very light malt backbone, with some bitternesss and drying."
When you crack the can you will be blown away. The aroma is pungent and wonderful. It drinks smooth with a nice grainy bitter nip at the finish. Forget about the category breakdown.........this beer is simply awesome!
Excellent beer! Would like a little less carb but that's a nit pick
From Notes: Thanks Nat for the trade.
"Dank, but not overwhelmingly resiny. Juicy and citrusy. Really good stuff."
"Tastes really close Heady Topper, but still just a little ways away. A lot smoother taste than The Substance"
"Can from Joe. Had this right after The Substance. Here we go. Poured to my Rapp Brewing tulip. Pours hazy deep yellow with a half finger of creamy white head. Aroma of pineapple and mango, deer honey, some pine, lots if citrus fruits and sweet pineapple. Mmm. Flavor follows with sweet pineapple notes, honey, but plenty of bitterness to balance the rich creaminess of the sweet tropical fruit: mango, pineapple, and some citrus peel. Creamy body, medium to medium low carbonation. This is good."
I
Great beer. Tons of aroma
This is like hop candy! It has the hype of a limited quantity beer with a balanced flavor and an almost too easily crushable style.!! At 8.0 abv get ready!
"Beer is an attractive gold with a creamy white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is dank and tropical hops. Guava. Taste follows the nose. Some light malt and then a complex, tropical hop finish. Perfectly bitter. Mouthfeel is nice. Well carbonated, substantial without being heavy, and very drinkable. All in all a fantastic beer."
"Wow this surprised me. Pours a light, hazy, amber with limited head. The lack of head may have been part of my pour. The smell is TONS of juicy tropical fruits (Mango, Pineapple, and a bit of orange). There's a light breadiness there too. Taste is on point with smell and is VERY smooth. Not much pine/bitterness. Just fantastic. This may have jumped into my top ten IPA's with just one can!"
This is the most drinkable best ipa beer around.
"Exceptionally drinkable beer with a nice body and hop balance. Not as much of the fruit and piny flavors come through as expected, it has a more muted floral scent and flavor. A really good beer that is in sight of the DIPA greats but goes its own way. What it does have over the likes of Heady and Pliny is its evenhanded flavor from start to finish. Could crush a lot of these in a night and be very happy."
"Happy, fresh delicious. 2nd only to topper... I said it."
Fresh can (canned on 1/1/2015)- reviewed 1/3/2015 
"Tried this on tap at the Tap Room the other night. AWESOME BEER! For someone who is big into IPA and a ton of hops, it really was a nice change of pace."
"Spectacular hop showcase in a liquid. Nose and taste all hops, minimal bitterness. Excellent DIPA."
Good Double IPA
"Canned 10/30/18 ""NO TV AND NO BEER MAKE HOMER GO HAZY"""
Incredibly well balanced and smooth. I go back and forth on whether I like this more than Julius. Pretty sure Tree House can’t make a bad NEIPA. Well done!
16-oz. can 10/30/18 needed a medium-strong pour to get a finger sized foamy and creamy off-white head. Irregular spots of lace as the head retreats to a lasting cap.
Can dated 10/30:
A million thanks to Jon for this can of Haze. My very first. 
look: hazy golden peach. Big frothy head on the pour. Messy clinging lace.
Taste or orange in this very smooth double IPA. Much less bitter in taste compared to other DIPA from Treehouse (eg Doppelgänger). Color is orange with optimal carbonation.
Special; sublime; smoother than I expected. A citrus bomb - you'll want to lick the lacing off the glass to not lose a single taste of orange. I don't taste or sense the bitterness of some other DIPAs. It's almost dangerously easy to drink for its ABV level. A great accomplishment!
"Ok, so it looks like pineapple juice with a good inch of soapy bubbles on top. That foam clings pretty stubbornly to the glass. It looks like a NEIPA should look (except they can says it is a DIPA). Canned on 10/02/2018 and consumed on 10/7/18."
Experiment Time: I had a week old Haze and a three month old Haze. 
"16oz can. Pours a hazy (shocking) burnt yellow with an inch of frothy head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is orange, peach, papaya, pineapple and pink grapefruit. The taste is papaya, orange and pink grapefruit. Peach and papaya towards the end with some bread crusts. Medium body with low carbonation. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence. Creamy mouthfeel."
Canned on 9/26/18; consumed on 9/27/18. Pretty much as fresh as you can get it. . . .
From Zombier. In Teku glass. Canned 16 Aug. Bit of letdown. Good nose but not as fruity as expected in mouth and with vegetal bitter point that initially sees bad but improves with time
"07/2015 - While I like Green more, this is a delectable hoppy offering from TH; amidst the peach and pineapple there's a light bubblegum, esters on the nose; creamy, slightly dank, a touch of onion, but mostly juicy peach on the palate; the finish is candied fruit and only a touch of bitterness."
"Picked-up from a friend at Patriots tailgate. This is my fourteenth brew from these guys. This is a very solid brew, but not one of my favorites from TH, too lightly carbonated, not enough flavor."
Pours hazy yellow orange. Great looking beer. 
Canned this morning. As fresh as it gets. Overall this beer seemed flat. The color was a dull gold. The beer is thick and solid - fully opaque. The smell is mildly sweet. The brewery had the same mild aroma today. Taste is subtle. Nothing is over powering in it and the feel has a faint bite that lingers and mellows with time. For a DIPA this is an easy drinker.
Poured from a can dated 8/18/18 to a nonic.
"Super smooth, not much to comlain about a great IPA"
Poured from can into Teku glass. Thick hazy appearance typical of an NEIPA with a soft pillowly mouthfeel. Strong citrus auroma almost smells like orange juice at first. Taste notes of citrus and tropical fruits with a smooth finish that stays with you. Does not drink like a double which could creep up on you after a few. Overall fantastic beer highly recommend!
Poured from a can into a wine glass.
"Excellent IPS with fantastic taste of citrus and hops. Not too aggressive, just a good smooth DIPA. Have had 4 cans. Yummy."
Orange juice with a thin head that leaves a sticky ring
"A perfect beer. Fluffy body, huge citrus and peach notes and it tastes like eating a peach. All of that is followed up by some nice light dankness to add some complexity to the brew. An all day drinker"
"16 oz can, into glass"
Canned 7/31/18; 13:49:13
"Looks like a true hazy ipa, murky but still clean. the smell is a little fruity but you can definitely get the hops that come through that make it an IPA. I didn't like the taste at first, thought it was a little too plain but the more I drank it, the more it grew on me. True ipa with the hoppiness cut by the haze."
Hazy and delicious. Has a certain smoothness like a banana. Very enjoyable.
The smoothie of beers!
Look:
Tied for my favorite so far
Excellent juicy citrus with a hint of bitterness. Full mouthfeel that is super soft. Body matches the flavor with enough sweetness to balance. Tangerine and pineapple.
"this one is cool because the hop complexion is a little more familiar and old school. its northwestern and spicy and vegetal and piney to me, intense, like a west coast ipa that just also happens to be multigrain and hazy. this one has become famous for them, and i can certainly see why, it should appeal to ipa drinkers of all persuasions, oily and bitter too to an extent that the others i have had from them recently are not. i like this being a little more classically styled in terms of hop flavors, it allows me to easily appreciate what the grain base does for the hops, which is to extend them well beyond just the finish, and to almost balance their intensity with texture not with flavor, which is amazing, this is super soft and round and bubbly and exciting, unique feel for hoppy beer, and these guys have it dialed. grapefruit and orange zest in the nose, fresh pine, resinous and almost concentrated, intense in a delicious way. its not overly complex, but thats part of what makes it, the simplicity is great. its clean and pure and fresh, and while i might not rank it among the best hoppy beer in the world like so many folks here on BA have, i sure enjoyed the can and hope to be able to drink a bit more of this in the future. lucky to have had a friend send me these cans, i really enjoyed all of the tree house ive had recently, and totally see what all the hype is about!"
"Unlike lots of DIPAs, Haze did not reek of alcohol nor taste as such. I experienced a delicate balance between 8.2abv and a surprisingly drinkable and dangerous blend of citrus, tropical aroma and welcomed hoppiness."
"My first experience with this long-time whale! Canned on 5/16/2018 and poured into pint glass. It pours a hazy, dirty golden yellow color with a half finger of milk white head that dissipated slowly leaving a thin sheen of creamy lacing. The smell didn't pop as much as I anticipated but it nonetheless is fragrant with lemon, tangerine, vanilla, pine needles, and floral hops. The taste is everything I'd hoped for: a perfect balance of lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, lactose, and a delicious blend of hops that's bitter without biting. This is as easy a drinking DIPA as you'll ever find. It's creamy with a near perfect level of carbonation. And it goes down so smooth I can't believe it's 8.2% Overall, Haze is simply exquisite. It richly deserves its World-Class rating."
Poured to an Ora et Labora taster.
A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color. It poured with a finger high frothy white head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a short head covering the surface.
Poured from the can.
A: cloudy; deep gold in color; 1+ finger ivory head that receded to a thin cap; nice lacing;
"Wasn't bad, just wasn't amazingly great either."
A long time fan of Haze but this is the second batch I have had that is just a shadow of its former self. A batch in January 2018 and now this May batch. Aroma and taste is muted. I love TH consistency but something is up with Haze. Disappointing.
"Poured from can into tulip, good 2 finger cream colored soapy head. Good retention and good lacing. Bright turbid orange in the glass, almost glows. Smells of orange, mango & apricot. Initial taste follows the nose with the addition of mild grapefruit. Slight alcohol on the finish, similar to a mimosa. Mouthfeel on this beer is unbelievable. It is thick and rich and creamy."
We actually felt bad about using a paper cup this time. 
"It’s been awhile since I had regular Haze. After having said VH was only slightly better, I take that back. VH feels softer, but this has more taste somehow. I notice that classic peach mango flavor much more here"
"Seriously amazing. DIPA but zero heat, sweet, with hints of orange and papaya. Nose a bit light compared to the taste but still pleasant. Mouth feel is so smooth and fluffy."
My favorite Tree House beer!!!
"Typical hazy light orange, pineapple pour. Very juicy taste. One of the “sweetest” ipas I’ve had. Not a lot of nose though, I was surprised."
Very good buzz.
Where did haze go!!! This beer used to be fire.
Still one of my favorites.
"Very good, lot of depth. Smell was better than the overall taste. Not sure how long I would wait in line for it given all the other great local beers but glad to try it."
"Pretty tasty - but is it substantially better than any of the other NE IPAs out there? I don't think so, but the can I came across was nearly four months old, so who knows."
Can from Jacob
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/6/2018. Pours opaquely hazy medium orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, kiwi, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, kiwi, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very minimal pine, zesty, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, lime, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, kiwi, guava, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; very smooth, creamy, silky, and bready mouthfeel that is insane. Light sticky hops and lightly increasing lingering bitter dryness. Minimal warming alcohol for 8.2%. Overall this is an insane NE DIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and insanely easy to drink for the ABV; with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Softest of the soft mouthfeel was perfect. Insanely juicy and lightly dank hops; balanced bready malts, not overly sweet/heavy feeling for the ABV. A highly amazing offering, and perfect style example."
"A - super beautiful hazy, off-yellow color, perfect oily lacing"
Appearance: poured a yellowish peach color completely hazy with a bright white foamy head.
Pretty damn dank and juicy. Hides it's abv extremely well. Smells and tastes like peach and citrus.
Poured from can to teku.
"Can to chalice. Thick head with lots of retention, lace on glass. Hazy orange color. Combination of tropical fruit and earthy dankness in the nose. Big fruity hop flavor, with grapefruit, orange, melon, followed by similar earthy finish. Smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable. Excellent DIPA."
"Pours a hazy, bright orange coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells intensly of hoppy tropical and citrus aromas: passion fruit, guava, grapefruit and tangerine. Taste follows the nose, with a very hop-forward, juicy and slightly dank taste of tropical and citrus fruits: passion fruit, guava, grapefruit and tangerine. Almost no malt detectable at all. Pretty sweet and a little zesty, with a very light bitterness coming through in the aftertaste. V ery nice, smooth and creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonisation. This reminds me a LOT of Other Half Double Mosaic Daydream, without quite reaching its mouthfeel, but a slightly nicer balance and bitterness."
"Pours a bright yellow, clouded color with a one finger broad white head."
Great straight from the tap at the brewery. Definitely drops off after a couple of weeks but one of my favorite beers fresh. The new brewery is awesome too
Beautiful pure haze light orange
Have has this beer in cans and on tap. On tap It is as if they put a half Inch whipped cream on top. I have tried but cannot seem to recreate this from the can but I get to drink this at home. This review is a combination of what I had on tap and from the can. I would recommend trying both.
"Pours a beautiful hazey golden/yellowish color. Looks like peach juice. Aroma fills the room with notes of peach, orange and passion fruit. The taste follows with peach and orange up front and an oniony dankness on the back end. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel. Dankness lingers a bit longer than expected and stays with an aftertaste I can do without. Leaves beautiful lacing all over the glass. Really nice beer overall."
Hazy. Lighter in color. Like mango/pineapple juice. Thin white head. 
"Pours a hazy orange color with a one inch white head that left gorgeous spots of lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of tropical fruits with a hint of orange. Tastes of orange, orange peel, peach, mango, a bit of onion and pepper. Medium bodied and carbonated, slightly dry mouth feel and mild to medium bitter finish."
"Golden and hazy, not overly opaque like Green, but moderately hazy, with 2 fingers of whitish head. Some chunks of yeast are floating within. Nice, chunky lacing as well."
Canned 1/13/17; drank 1/22/17 @ the Yarchives. 
Yum x100
"Looks appetizing- hazy golden straw color, thick and juicy."
Picked up this morning at the brewery s not even a Day old. 
This is in my top three TH brews I've had (along with Dopple and Green).
"16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose"" "
Classic TH NEIPA. Overflowing head and bouquet. Strong flavor but smoother than 8.2%. Maybe peach nose but overall a general citrus punch.
"Pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head. Nose is of citrus skin and light pine. Taste is a thing of beauty! A nice citrus punch in the mouth. Both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges, grapefruit and lemon. Nice malt backbone although minimal presence, you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced. Meadium creamy body. Smooth to drink. Finishes with with a"
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. Has a big juicy citrus aroma. Nice juicy taste with a good amount of citrus and some piney resin at the end. Bitterness is spot on. A little on the heavy side, but excellent. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
Another great brew from Treehouse!!
"Pours with a cloudy yellow-orange haze with a burst of tropical fruit in the aroma and flavor. Overall not quite as flavorful as I had hoped and the alcohol comes through which is a surprise. Missing the mark of the typical TH pillowy mouthfeel as well. Consumed at just past 3 weeks, possibly past its prime."
"Nice color looking like dark pineapple juice, citrus aromas and sweet peach... nice mouth feel and very hoppy finish, slight aftertaste.... can taste the 8.2 but ever so slightly ... 2-3 might be max at one siting but still great offering"
Delicious.
16oz can poured into a tulip
"Hazy NE IPA golden color. Foamy head that quickly disappears. Juicy explosions at first pour. Smooth taste, little after taste, not too hoppy. Good mouth feel, some creaminess yet too much lingering feel. Overall great offering from TH, easy to drink everyday."
"What a good beer. Crisp clean taste of an IPA without the lingering aftertaste so common with IPAs. The beer felt ""full"" in the mouth without a syrupy or slimy texture. Smell was nice and pleasant with a lite hop/grain aroma."
"Can dated 9/14/17 - about 6 weeks old, which may influence the review (i.e. hop flavor has faded a bit)"
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; produced on 10/25/2017 -- three days ago.
"Goodness, me. A gift from a friend, just back from Western MA. "
Canned 12 days ago. 
Do you really need another review? What’s not to like here?
"Near opaque light orange pour, dare i say hazy, thumb sized head, good retention, lacing. Aroma of melon, orange, peach. Orange juice up front, very light dankness, pineapple, canteloupe, peach. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel, perfect for this type of beer. Damn."
What beautiful beer!
"a: hazy (surprise surprise) bright burnt orange color. there is a very vibrant caramel color in here as well which looks just like one of those caramel candies. head pours 2 fingers, solid bright white. it settles to about 1/2 finger pretty quickly though"
"woahhh this one had way more dankness than any of the other TH beers ive tried! up front there is some juicy orange and a hint of stone fruits, definitely getting that peppery spice and some bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit peel and pine needles on the finish ... everything is pretty mellow and blends together except this massive dankness throughout. mouthfeel is on point. overall very enjoyable and quite different than most TH to my taste."
Look- thick pineapple juice with a little OJ thrown in as well
"Great head, but a little too sweet for my taste"
Pours a matte light yellow-orange color. Looks like OJ. Completely opaque. Thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a residual thin layer of foam and lots of sticky white lacing behind. For the NE style IPA this is an excellent appearance. 
16oz can dated 9/14/17.
Favorite IPA from Tree House
"Lovely stuff. Orange and peach, a touch of passionfruit, a bit of a oily, herbal flavour. Pretty mild bitterness. Malt is very restrained. Creamy and smooth, alcohol very well hidden. Beautiful. A real pleasure to drink."
"16oz can, purchased from the Brewery, not sure the date, but known to be very fresh. Poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 3.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
A - nice murky golden orange amber color with a thick white head that sticks
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Nice balanced aroma of citrus and hops. Taste is also a very smooth balance of hops and citrus.
Had this recently . Overall another tree house masterpiece.
"Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy gold with thick rocky white head. Incredible fruity aroma. Lots of orange with some grapefruit and lemon. Incredibly balanced. Flavors of orange, peach, grapefruit, pineapple with some floral and resin notes. Extremely drinkable. Incredible IPA."
"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew, again."
"Fresh can from the brewery. Super excited to get this on the random day I was heading to TH. I was surprised how similar this is to Julius. Pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice. Medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere. Unlike some murky NE IPAs, this remains bright despite being super hazy. Nose is slightly bigger than Julius, but still didn't quite match what I expected based on what I'd previously heard. Nice orange zest, some tropical notes, and certainly yeastier than I expected. Taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit I get. Plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note. Mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks. Overall, a great beer that didn't quite match the hype but was still a great experience."
"Canned 8/1. Deep orange with an inch and a half head that left nice lacing the whole way down the glass. Smell was a bit muted from what I was expecting but you get a nice nose full of papaya and peach plus a hint of grass/onion. Some orange comes out as well but more so from when it is in the can than the glass. Tastes of pine, grapefruit, melon with a bitter backbone. Remarkably smooth despite the bitterness, very soft, modestly carbonated. No way you would know this is 8.2%. No doubt one of the best beers I've had in my life. TreeHouse is a hike for me but, this one was well worth the drive! If you have it, treasure it. If you don't, make the effort to get your hands on this."
From fresh 16 oz can. For a North East DIPA where's none better then this! Overall a near perfect beer.
Sampling my first Tree House beer. Excited to check out the hype and experience the brewery. Have some cans of other examples waiting for me.
Smell of pineapple and mango juice. Almost like drinking a blend of grapefruit and orange juice. Creamy body turns a bit dry in the finish. This is a lovely brew with almost no hop protein burn. Worth the hype.
"We got you stuck off the real ness, we be the infamous. You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers. The mob come equipped for warfare beware, and so on and thusly. In addition to the opening to Shook Ones pt. 2, all I can say about this beer is fantastic execution."
"Look: Yellow, turbid, hazy, with 2 inch white head. Medium low carbonation."
"Such an extraordinary beer. Poured from the can into a teku. Pours a thick, smoothie yellow. The nose and palate are bursting with tropical fruit, and there's an amalgamation of sweet citrus and hop here that works beautifully. Not many beers hit this level of excellence."
"Smell: fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh peach, papaya, tangerine, mango, yellow grapefruit, Bubblegum. A little bit of a green note. No real malt presence. It smells like a fruit smoothie."
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance lived up to it’s name, definitely orange haziness colored with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that leveled off at a nice pace. Sly thin lacing forms around the sides evenly. The aroma starts off with a bright and juicy orange juice, pulpy with big bitter balancing rind-like qualities. Sweet onion dankiness slides in for an extra ferocity of the aroma. The flavor brings it all together bittersweet with a spectacular orange juice to sweet onion aftertaste. Excellent sweet to danky finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a smooth sweet to bitter feel rolling over my tongue. Nothing clings, just feels absolutely awesome as it hits my tongue. Overall, hot damn, what an absolutely amazing DIPA. I would definitely have again."
"Pours a very opaque lightly orange tinged pale - nice head that leaves massive lacing. Aroma is juicy and tropical, some underlying biscuit. Flavor and mouthfeel are delightful, smooth and rich with nice bitterness. Tasty beer!"
"Very delicious IPA, it's amazing that it's over 8 % alcohol considering you barely taste the hoppiness of the IPA."
"Pours a hazy dark orange, with soft, fluffy foam."
"Got this bad boy in a trade, can't wait to try it! Poured into a tulip glass from a 1 Pint can, 8.2% ABV. Bottled date 5/25/17."
"Simply, the is a jacked up Julius."
"Hands down the most drinkable 8.2% beer I've ever tasted, only surpassed by Very Hazy. The smell is great, feel is excellent, the look is outstanding - as the name describes, this is the absolute perfection of the hazy look. Taste is sweet, but not overbearing in the slightest, and aggressively hopped. World class, my favorite TH beer."
Juicy af
"This beer is exceptional. Uniform peach haze with half finger of white head. Not murky. Their description is spot on with orange, peach, and passion fruit all present. Overall awesome. Flavor and mouthfeel make the beer. Aroma could come out a little more maybe and then it would be perfect."
"P- Acquired through a trade, on South Shore Beer Exchange. Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.Date on the can is 05/05/17."
"Great beer. Not sure how it's currently 100 rated, but it for sure is an excellent beer. What separates this beer from other stellar offerings from Alchemist, Trillium, Other Half etc... is the resinous finish. It finishes with a strong bitter, resin taste but it quickly dissipates. Outstanding smooth mouth feel, explosion of hops and fruits in the taste and smell. Excellent beer, well worth the wait."
"had this from a 2L growler. The look of this beer is truly amazing. almost orange in hue. the scent is also spectacular with heavy fruity notes. If that is your bag (i.e. super fruity NE IPAs) than this is the perfect beer. growler brew did go pretty flat very quickly, but this is probably not unique to Treehouse brews."
My 500th Beer! 
"Pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head. The smell is amazing. You can taste mango, peach, pineapple and tropical fruits. So good"
Probably my favorite Treehouse brew. Excellent aroma and goes down even better. One a day keeps the doctor away!
Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 3/22/17.
Great beer. Thoroughly enjoyed trading for this. Would love to have again can't wait until I come across Very Hazy.
16oz can (packaged on 3/20/17) poured into belgian tulip glass.
"Pours deep orange. Nice lacing. Aroma strong hops. Taste hops,tropical fruits,peach mango and pineapple. Mouth feel is silky. Another beast. Treehouse never disappoints."
Love in a can.
My first treehouse beer. Looks an opaque yellow with deep orange hues. Smells strong of hops and tropical fruity funk. Taste follows with initial bitterness ridden out by sweet flavors similar to the nose. Probably the best beer I have had.
Pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing. Aroma is the usual citrus and dank tropical fruit but with a strong peach accent. Flavor follows. Very delicious with perfect balance and fluffy mouthfeel. No alcohol detected. This is a very drinkable beer for over 8% alcohol. Another winner.
"Canned on 3/22/2017. Day 12 fresh. Peer down the mouth of the can and it's murky mango orange juice. A slow, deliberate pour summons a white pillowy foam which creeps up the teku but leaves quickly. We are left with a hazy tropical juice. The mouhthfeel is special. So soft. So full of flavor. The hops are miniature gymnasts tumbling on my palette leaving peach Starbursts on the taste buds throughout the entire sip. I taste peach orange juice at the front end and then lemon zest and pineapple on the finish. Delightful. Haze"
"Poured this into a snifter. Looks hazy and with a little color of orange juice. The smell is amazing of tropical fruits, pineapple, mango and a hint of peach. Tastes are almost as described in the smells, and has a very smooth body. Overall, this was my first TH beer, and really enjoyed it."
"Very good IPA, one of the better offerings from tree house. This one is more on the dank, pine side of the IPAD spectrum as opposed to tropical and fruit side. I suggest actively seeking this one out only if you are a big fan of IPAs."
Look: pours a nice hazy orange. The kind of look you expect from a Treehouse DIPA with immense juicy aroma. 
"Had this on 2017-03-18 in Lititz, PA from a 16oz can dated 2017-02-23."
"Haze lives up to it's name by pouring a murky light brown, another beer that can completely block out the sun (note: a_andersen does not recommend you expose your Haze to direct sunlight). The flavor profile jumps between fruity mango and ripe plantain, at times throwing off vegetable flavors."
"L: hazy, juicy, lacing"
"Great beer. Full bodied, but so smooth for its 8.2%. Smell and taste is fruity and dank. I could drink this all day...until it got me drunk! Worth trying again. Worth buying."
"Another home run from Treehouse. Haze pours a turbid, pale yellowish orange, looks just like pineapple/orange juice in the glass. A lasting one finger head. The smell is big beautiful orange, mango, tropical fruit, a bit of peach. Taste follows the nose, orange, citrus, tropical fruits, just a touch for dankness hiding in the back. Very soft bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, like a velvet pillow of fruit in your mouth. Overall this one of the best IPA/DIPAs I have had, in the top 3 from Treehouse for me, Bright being my favorite. Goes down oh so easy, no hint of alcohol even though it's 8.2% abv."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy mango/orange juice with one finger thick white head. Smell is tropical fruit/hop juice that hits you in the face with notes of orange, peach, mango, and pineapple. Some light resin and honey is coming trough as well. Taste follows the nose with orange pulp most noticeable. There is a little bit of sweetness and low bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish. "
"Good lord, this is good. Medium gold color, essentially opaque, tall head of white foam, lacing down glass... Aromas of citrus and pale orchard fruits, maybe something floral about it, too... flavor impressions follow suit - orange, stone fruit, grapefruit - all with just a hint of muskiness... Smooth and soft, moderate carbonation; drinks clean and easy - I could knock back a few of these with no problem... 2/23/17 canning."
can dated 2/15/17
Canned 19 Jan 2017. Aroma is apricots and peach with a subtle sweet caramel. Palate is full of flavour and a perfect balance of dried apricots and a long dry bitterness.
"Pours an opaque pale yellow with rich two finger head, slowing reducing to a film of bubbles. Decent lacing, some alcohol legs."
The beer looks incredible even by Tree House standards. It has that bubblegum flavor that a lot of Tree House has but in this case it is a little bit too overwhelming.
"First had 1/24/17 at home from Andy K. Smells tropical, and follows through to the flavor with peach and papaya, not much bitterness. Creamy, pillowy mouthfeel with a cloudy, turbid appearance. Could drink this beer everyday for the rest of my life and not be disappointed."
Poured from a 16 oz can dated 1-18-17 into a snifter glass.
This and Julius are pretty much the pinnacle of what Tree House is going for.
Great Beer. Dangerous. Ive never had a beer that was so drinkable at 8.2 % I finished this beer in a heartbeat. Felt more like a session IPA. In a good way.
Holy Cow. This beer rocks.
"16oz can, acquired from the brewery."
"Poured into a snifter. A turbid golden-yellow color with a frothy white head. The foam slowly settled into a nice firm cap. The aroma was bright - tropical fruit, grass, and a nice dank resiny smell. Incredible taste with tropical fruit, mango, oranges, dank notes, and a bit of pine. A restrained but present crackery and bready malt backbone. Silky mouthfeel."
"Split a can of this with my roommate and good friend Chris, who snagged it as a trade from his work buddy. Cheers Chris! I've had the privilege of having several Tree House beers in the past, but not this one as far as I recall (I think I'd probably remember having this if I did)."
"I suppose this would be my first ever ""juice-bomb"" that I've tasted. It was canned today, and pours really hazy, a very pale orang colour with thin white head. Aroma is nice, very powerful. Juicy (orange, mango, peach), also a hoppy/floral scent as well. It has a really nice scent. Taste is juice. I've never had a beer like it, that tastes so smooth and flavourful. It hides its ABV content and really just goes down easy. I do prefer beers with a more hoppy/floral bite to them, but to each their own. Really nice beer I'm happy to have. Skål"
"Very haze doh, looks life pineapple juice, one finger white head"
Poured from a 16 oz can into a Aslin Beer Co stemmed glass. Canned 11-20-2016. 
Had this out of order - so it may have hurt the review a little. I was lucky enough to have Very Hazy before trying Haze. Very Hazy may be the best beer I've ever had. Haze is still awesome. Treehouse again knocks it out of the park.
Hazy as advertised. Thin dissipating head. Pine and mango on the nose. Overripe mango and waves of bitter resin collide here and settle into a strong pithy afterglow. Palate buster for sure. Awesome Tree House offering.
"Sweet heavens. Velvety mouthfeel. Fruity forward, herbaceous late. Everything I like about west coast meets east coast. Nailed it."
Drank the day I brought it home from the brewery out of a TEKU. The line at the brewery was stupid long.
Flawless
Very nice DIPA.
16 oz. can
Liked this the first couple times I tried it but more recently have tired of this ultra juicy style.
"Incredible IPA, so sad that I was only able to get 5 cans. Tree house in a class all by itself"
"Good one here, didn't enjoy quite as much as Alter Ego and Green. The aroma here was interesting, had almost a banana aroma going on. Flavor is very fruity, hops are less pronounced. Feel is medium-full."
This beer is amazing. It pours very cloudy in a tulip glass. The aroma is peach and grapefruit. The taste is tart and fruity without being overly sweet. The mouthfeel is incredible. Treehouse simply makes the best IPAs in the United States. Everyone is a treasure.
Wow!
"This is amazing, the aroma is incredible. Honestly, the only knock I have is some excess bitterness probably due to this being two months old, otherwise this beer was outstanding."
"oh wow, took a while for me to get my hands on this but it was well worth the wait, very smooth and virtually no alcohol prominence whatsoever, for a 8.2 very smooth and drinkable, a grapefruit IPA with orange showing slightly on finish, wish it could be a regular for me....great feel and carbonation, a smooth sipper that improved with it warming in glass"
"16oz can from the Brewery: This one pours a milky, darker straw yellow color. There was about a finger of a frothy off white head that leaves some lacing. Very nice nose. Orange, pineapple, peach, maybe some earthiness. The taste is excellent. A fairly good amount of bitterness. Orange, pineapple, a bit of resinous hops. Good malts in the background."
"Pours hazy and looks like orange juice in the glass though tad more towards yellow than straight orange. The smell follows the look on this one. Orange up front along with peach notes. Going along with the balance the beer, the taste follows the nose as the nose follows the looks. Sweet up front with orange citrus predominating. The back end is very balanced and not that bitter at all. Notes of orange candy linger. The feel is medium thick. Overall this is an amazing beer; orangey and tasty!"
Drank it out of the can. Smells awesome taste is smooth and fruity. would have liked slightly more bite. Maybe that is the magic for 8.2 % went down real easy. I would like to try this on draft. Outstanding I really want to try this again.
"Like other TH pale ales, this one isn't much to look at. Where it shines is the hop finish that is lacking in some of the brewery's other popular offerings. The citrus aroma isn't nearly as overpowering as it is in Julius, Green, or Alter Ego. The taste has a better malt/hops balance. The mouthfeel and body are right on par with the best TH has to offer. A fine example of the NE-style pale ale."
"Haaze is the best ""normal"" IPA TH makes. It has a peach-like quality to it. Sometimes it can be rank though. I got a growler fill once and it was nasty. This beer must be consumed quickly after canning. Overall, one of their better beers."
From a can dated 10/18/16.
"Pours an opaque fiery orange with a finger of foamy white head. Head retention is strong with lacing prevalent after each sip. A low volume head is a bit of a disappointment on a high caliber IPA, especially a IIPA. Aroma is dripping with citrus, orange, and resin hops. Very tasty so far. A sip provides a blast of hops, and citrus - in a good way. Notes include citrus, orange, tangerine, and resin. The hops are well managed and balanced, keeping this heavy hitting beer from being difficult to drink. Mouth feel is filling, while only be a medium to medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a very pleasing beer that is strong across all fronts. The hops are well balanced and thought out. The alcohol taste is well hidden and buried behind a flavorful, powerful beer. "
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma has really juicy hops with nice tropical flavors. Taste is even more intense. Lots of peaches and apricots, mango, some pineapple and a good amount of grassy bitterness on the finish. Full bodied and well carbonated. Another great one from Tree House."
L: Hazy Amber. Lacing is absolutely gorgeous
"Phenomenal cloudy, Hazy, liquid. Smell of pineapple, peach, and mango. Tropical, creamy smooth feel. Overall superb brew."
"Just an awesome, awesome, juicy, hoppy beer."
S: Apricots. Peaches. Mango. Pineapple. Grapefruit. Orange juice. Grass. Earthy spice.
"Appearance - Pours cloudy pulpy orange color, looks like a glass of orange juice. Nice white head great lacing."
"Split a growler, it pours cloudy yellow gold color that has the classic New England IPA looks. Head was foamy, off white and about 1 finger thick, fading slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing."
L: Very orange in color with a white frothy head that stays around for a while.
Overall Excellent beer. A bit more malty than other treehouse IPAs. Tropical smell and flavors. Light carbonation and slight fading bitterness. I'd get this one again.
"Bought a 750 ML growler on Thursday 9/29. Appearance includes a very murky yellow orange with a thick, bubbly head with thick lacing on the sides. Aromas are very apparent with grapefruit, tangerine, and orangepeel smells. Taste follows the nose with an incredibly fruity (citrus mostly) flavor, including a sharp orange aftertaste. The mouthfeel really helps to bring out the flavors by making this beer have a medium carbonation while being very refreshing. Overall, this was a fantastic beer, especially with its aromas."
"Hazy (to be expected). Taste is super-mango, super fruity, with a bitter, wet finish. I can taste the alcohol very slightly. Flavor spreads nicely, good drinking beer."
Poured from growler 2 days after buying. Dark orange murky look. Big juicy notes of mango and melon/passionfruit. I found finish to be pretty bitter. Enjoyed this but little underwhelmed.
Very nice double IPA. Nice aroma out of the glass with the same hazy appearance as most every other Treehouse beer that I have had. Great fruit and tropical flavors on the palette as well.
"My 1st Treehouse brew I was able to trade for. Canned 8/13/16 poured into Teku glass. Milkshake haze orange appearance brings an insane aroma of pineapple, mango orange when I popped open the can. Taste is mango, orange hoppy goodness with a very boozy finish I was not expecting (but enjoyed). Overall very crushable the alcohol burn on the finish is what pushed this to almost a 5 for me most juice bombs I have had are a little too sweet. Will definitely be seeking out a lot more TH in the future."
Canned date of 07/20/16
"Pours a hazy (obviously) golden yellow color with a frothy bone white head. The smell hits your nose right as you open the can. Notes of mango, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, and orange. Also getting a slightly weedy aroma as well. Taste is majorly up front with pineapple, mango, and guava, with bitter grapefruit and orange zest coming through towards the end. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Carbonation is slightly low but helps with the overall mouthfeel. Overall, an amazing NE DIPA. It has that typical tropical taste and smooth feel you'd expect from breweries like Tree House, Trillium, and Monkish."
Excellent selection if you're looking to try Treehouse beers and can't get your hands on Julius or Green. Tastes great!
Big thanks to Kegatron for the growler share. Poured into a snifter appears a milky looking melted creamsicle orange color with a white head that holds well painting the glass with a curtain of lace.
an amazing IPA unlike many i have had . a unique flavor with note of papaya. the nose and mouth on this beer is so pleasant and different
"From the 16oz can, dated 09/07/16, served in an imperial pint/nonic."
"L: Cloudy, milky orange yellow. Coul d almost pass for mango juice. Two to three fingers of head. Left a thick lacing all the way down the glass. "
Another winner from Treehouse. Tasty n juicy like everything I've had from them. Very easy to drink and smooth. Like pretty much everyone who's had TH brews I just wish you could get more.
Look: Opaque hazy orange with a white head. 
"Wow. This beer starts off with and amazing pour, both in its coloration and it's beautiful head. Hazy, almost pastel orange colour. Appears practically radioactive. Screaming juicy and it doesn't disappoint. Strong blood orange aroma. Taste is well balanced. Oranges with a bit of peach. Not too sweet or acidic. Soft mouth feel with considerable body. A real thrill to drink this!"
Can dated 07/20/16.
"Of the half dozen or so Tree House offerings that I have had, I still think that this is my overall favorite. It looks beautiful in the glass, as do most all of their beers - appears as a hazy, golden pineapple with a bit of white head that leaves a very nice lacing as the beer goes down. Nose consists of tropical fruit and citrus along with notes of peach. Taste is similar but mixed with a touch of dank hops. That note of peach comes through in the taste as well and there are hints of pepper towards that finished that make me assume there's some Amarillo hops to this one, which is likely why I'm such a fan of this beer. Feel is as expected - smooth and slightly creamy. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I wish I could get consistently and IMO, the best of their ""regular"" offerings."
16 oz. can. 3 days old
"Look: cloudy, golden orange with a thick creamy looking head"
"From the 16 oz. can dated Aug 24, 2016. Sampled the same day on Aug 24, 2016."
"Look : Hazy, as the same says. Little bit dark but pretty similar compared to Julius."
"Another great beer from Treehouse. Similar to the Julius - very similar to me. Exotic flavors shine through - notes of fruit, mango, orange, rine - seems to be a staple with Treehouse. Tastes extremely similar to the Julius - smooth, refreshing, definite dankness to this one, hops shine through, but the fruit definitely is at the front of the flavors. The fruit blends in and is in balance with the malt backbone.. it all works - beautifully."
Canned 8/3. Consumed 8/11.
16 oz. can dated 8/3/16. Poured into 18 oz. Belgian ale glass.
"Like many Tree House beers, its somewhere between yellow and orange and 'hazy' as hell. There is always this slightly creamy head as well. Beautiful."
L.currently drinking from the gorgeous can
"I think Haze has overtaken Julius as my favorite from the ""regular offerings""."
L-poured from one day old Tree House growler. Pours hazy/opaque--screams dank by sight
Picked this up at the brewery on Wednesday when it was breweries. Poured into a tree house teku. 
One of my favorite DIPAs. All the signatures of a Tree House brew. Super fruit and juice bomb that hides the ABV very well.
"Looks great, orange and hazy"
"A citrus bomb, but not overly citrusy. There is some background bitterness. It has some backbone and complexity. Creamy and smooth (Tree House has perfected this ""pillowy"" mouthfeel), this is one to sip and enjoy as the flavors become more complex as it warms and opens. One word: yum."
Dank boozy but refreshing.
"Traded for this beer a little while back and wanted to have a full can of this after taking a sip of this in the Other Half line. Can dated 4/20 (ha!) with ""Alright X 3"" written below it as this still tasted fresh when I finally gave it a go today. No floaties as the haze was still present but not overpowering, indicating that there wasn't any massive sediment in this. Even though the Julius was more popular and the first beer that I had from Tree House, I liked this more as it wasn't as potent and was much more balanced, making it easier to sip without being hit over the head by juice and hops!"
"East Coast Juice Bomb, Extra Hoppy with a pop."
Opaque maize with a thick foam head and clingy lace.
"I love Green. The flavor of Haze is nice, but lacks the wow factor of Green. Haze is a smooth delicious ale and I thoroughly enjoyed drinking it."
Amazing. Nothing else to say.
"Love this beer. Classic tree house beer, perfect amout of orange smell. Has a fruit hop taste that I love. Very hazy was still the best, but another great IPA from tree house."
Pours Haze(y) OJ with a white head. Mouthfeel is the almost reminiscent of a stout how smooth it is. Crisp citrus hops at first sip with a bread malt backbone and. Finish is Unbelievably smooth and creamy. Drink this and a West Coast Bitter IPA and you wont think they are the same style. TEXTBOOK East Coast Juice Hazy IPA. Just as good as Julius imo.
First time to TH and got this. Thank you god for putting me there when they release this nectar!
"Beautiful, murky, orange with a finger and a half of bright white head"
"Purple can shared by someone tonight, thanks. "
Revisited 11/1/18
This beer lives up to its name. Looks like orange juice. White head.
"Classic Tree house brewing, great body, robust aromatics, mild sweetness on the end. Overall a delicious beer. Hugely flavorful without being overwhelming. Very little bittering hops"
Not my style of IPA
Can date: 5-25-16
Poured at 50°F from a pint can (canned on 20Apr16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 29May16.
"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color, with one inch head. Look exemplifies the New England hazy ipa style. Taste is orange, tangerine, peach, and dank wet hops. The orange really jumps as the beer warms. Super light bodied for the style. No beer with this high an ABV has the right to be this smooth. Of the ten or so Tree House brews I have had and it may be the best IPA I have ever had. Just an amazing beer."
05/25/2016
Very very good.
"Peach color with a nice white head and tons of lace. Notes of peach, mango, nectarine, light strawberry, pound cake and tropical fruit. Medium feel, crisp, clean and slightly dry. Amazing DIPA that ranks with the best of them."
wowza
"Just days from canning ,This poured light orange juice color , cloudy and murky almost looked like pulp orange juice, smell was citrus dankness with tropical fruit, Taste is perfect ripe citrus fruit of tangerine,mandarin ,grapefruit,orange with tropical dankness of papaya and mango, a great mouth feel with a non bitter hop assault , albsoluty delicious with no sign of ABV , this is as good a 2IPA that you will ever find."
"With the balance of pale ale but with the complexity, intensity and strength of imperial ale, Tree House brewers push the limits on hop aroma and flavor while keeping the bitter-to-sweet ratio a little closer to even-keel."
Outstanding citrus nose. Deep orange pour from the can as hazy as the name implies. Similar to Sip of Sunshine but a bit more dank.
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (TH stemware, for those curious). There’s a canning date of May 2, 2016 printed in black ink on the underside of the can, which reads “KEEP COLD 05 02 16 SUHH DUDE”—which would make this five days old at the time of consumption. This was purchased at the brewery on the 4th, and it immediately went into the fridge so these are essentially ideal tasting circumstances. "
Had from 2 day old growler obtained at TH Brewery
"Cloudy hazy orange color as the name suggests & the brewery is known for. Head disappears quick & leaves a sticky resiny lacing. Smell is tropical fruit, orange & grapefruit. Taste is bitter but citrusy, just like other TH beers. The Bitterness lingers. It's tingly & sharp. As I drink I notice there's a lot of settling happening with a lot dropping out to bottom of glass. I think this is fine but overrated."
"Poured into a snifter from a can dated ""4 20 Alright x 3"". Perfect! Dank hop aroma and less hazy than Julius or Green. Oh so fruity! Perfect IPA taste! Shared from a DLD trade!!"
Haze is an exceptional DIPA for a few reasons-one it drinks like a much lighter beer- the fruit aromas are a bouquet of tropical fruit; the mouthful is substantial; I love purple and haze
"Hazy, hoppy goodness. Not a big fan of hops, in general, but TH beers have made me learn how to deal with them for their delicious hoppy beers. Certainly not out of this world, but a damn solid beer."
thanks so much to tenderbranson69 for sharing this -from the can in a tulip chilled. 
"This beer is good but certainly not in my top 10 for DIPAs. It looks hazy as expected with a nice orange hue. It has good citrus smells and flavor with a slightly dank bitter aftertaste which again is good but not great. There are so many breweries that aren't hyped up nearly as much as TH that do it better (for example Cellarmaker). Other than Julius, which is an excellent yet one dimensional juice bomb, I don't see why everyone is going so ape shit over this brewery."
"poured into snifter. wonderful look of cloudy pineapple juice. nose is fresh mango, pineapple maybe slight orange. mouthfeel is excellent just like all treehouse where your entire mouth is coated by hop particles. flavor profile seems to be fresh pineapple and citrus followed by some juicy grapefruit and rounding out with some nice sweetness. this beer is overall outstanding like all treehouse. im not sure if this is better or worse than julius, alter , green. etc. they are all really outstanding. it just depends on what hops your palate likes best. edit: did side by side with very hazy and very similar. very had little more nose and more bitterness. slightly more flavor throughout. little darker in color."
Serving: Can
"Canned 4/20/2016. Can saying: ""Alright x 3"". I can dig the Matthew McConaughey reference."
"L - hazy - as advertised. good lacing on the glass, lighter towards the top and grows deeper in the snifter."
"This beer pours an opaque cloudy burnt orange with a golden hue when held up to the light. The head is dense, 2 fingers and bright white. Retention is excellent and there are intricate patterns of webbed lacing all over the glass. Smell is orange, grapefruit, pineapple and dankness. Absolutely incredible. Taste is the same with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Feel is light side of medium, soft and juicy with a sticky finish. Overall this beer is absolutely immaculate. The best double IPA I've ever had by a pretty wide margin."
16oz tallboy can poured into a snifter glass.
My favorite tree house beer. Haziness in the best possible ways
"This is quite possibly the most vile, putrid, and over-hyped beer I have ever consumed. It smells of a sun-baked, two week overdue litter box and tastes like a combination of mango, papaya, and guava juice mixed with alley cat urine. I suspect the carefully selected hop mixture has a neurotoxic effect on the brain that forces formerly astute beer drinkers to stand in line for hours awaiting their Great Depression era rations of this sludge. Chemical engineering and marketing genius. Looks like beer. Feel is tough to judge because it is forcefully ejected from my mouth before I have much time to ponder the oral sensation of this prized brew. Three cans sampled over eight months."
"Not my favorite offering from TH, but still really good."
"Just insane. This is 8.2%!? Amazing depth of flavor. From bitter to sweet to fruit to grass and even a hint of spice. Balanced with just a hit of the booze here. Crafted. Not just a haze bomb, hop bomb, juice bomb or fruit bomb... all of the above."
"Tasting my fourth tree house IPA ever. Only other ones I've had are green, alter ego, Julius, and this one. So I'll go head and make a few comparisons."
"From 16oz can packaged 13 days ago, enjoyed in a swell tulip glass after coaching a BU14 evening soccer practice. This beer is a terrific value, as craft beer prices continue to creep up and up, you want to drink this one."
"Poured from a 750ml growler filled 3/19/16 into a 12 ounce tulip. The look is cloudy and opaque. It looks like pineapple juice but a little darker and more orange. Small, white head, which dissipated quickly, leaving moderate lacing. The smell is strong oranges - almost smells like orange juice - with a hoppiness coming through underneath. The mouthfeel is very smooth with medium carbonation. The taste is strong citrus - orange, and some grapefruit - but the hop presence is much stronger than I expected from the smell. In no way is any one flavor overpowering. This beer is incredibly balanced with no hint of alcohol. Overall, this beer is fantastic and very easy to drink. I completely understand the hype on the beer, and Tree House, if all their IPAs follow the quality of this one. Every taste gives me a little hint of different flavors. I'll definitely look for more from them, given the chance."
"Fantastic beer that I most recently had on 4/7 canned 3/30. Whole depth of flavors including the papaya and peach that are advertised. Grapefruit, melon, pineapple as well. Very unique beer and VERY delicious. Hazy DIPA and what an amazing offering from TH."
"To me, all of Tree House's releases are world class in that they contain the signature creaminess. This element really puts them above all the rest. Haze is no different. It's a nice rounded navel orange haze bomb with the aroma of grapefruit. The taste is much more tropical than most of their other releases. As stated in the description papaya comes through along with guava, dragon fruit, and some pineapple in addition to the citrus of grapefruit and orange. The feel is incredibly smooth with that chewy cream. Stellar beer."
Look: Super hazy: light yellow-orange with very little translucency. Creamy head with small tight bubbles retained around rim throughout the drink.
Nice beer. Grab what you can get. Good for the non super hoppy fans. 
"This is one of the best double IPA offerings I've ever tasted. It has a predominantly citrus scent, tastes like grapefruit/peach/fresh hops. Similar to other Tree House IPA's, but this one boasts a higher ABV which makes it a little more impressive to me. Overall, an outstanding beer."
This is the best beer that I have ever had!
"This would normally be 5's across, but Very Hazy exists."
"Pours a super hazy orange with a finger of white head, very reminiscent of orange juice. Aroma is very tropical, lots of mango, pineapple with some grapefruit, peach, and melon. Taste is much like the aroma with huge mango notes upfront, changing to pineapple, with melon in the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel. Overall this is another great example of a New England style IPA from Tree House but I just find this to be too juicy for my tastes."
Peach Julius
Another perfect beer by Tree House. Can't wait until they build their new facility.
"Can shared by Curran last night, thanks man."
"Hazy tangerine color, beautiful lacing"
Growler filled 2/16/17. Enjoyed 2/19/17 in my TH tulip.
As perfect a beer as I've ever had.
Can 16oz ABV 8.2%. Canned on: 3-16-16. Consumed 3-17-16. Not as fresh as I'd like. 
"Canned 3/01. Pours a very turbid, hazy orange color with a nice finger head that leaves a ton of lacing on the glass. Smells like a fresh bowl of mashed citrus fruit with a strong herbaceous note mixed in. Tastes like a fresh fruit smoothie; citrus, orange rind, peach, nectarine - awesome. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy for an IPA but I think Green still takes the cake. A killer offering from TH."
"Amazing double IPA. The smell and taste of this beer is incredible, orange and pineapple. Dark hazy color looks great in glass. Exceptional mouthfeel. One of my absolute favorites."
"Poured from a can into a teku. Peach and tropical fruit in both the nose and taste. Classic TH mouthfeel, which sets some of their offerings apart. Worth searching out."
"L: Murky, and yes hazy dark yellow orange. A beautiful glowing orb with some light behind it. Gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing."
"There's not much I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said. I really love this beer! It's got all the great characteristics of a Tree House beer, but with a bit more attitude. The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect."
Fantastic. Treehouse classic.
Canned 03/01/16
"Similar vibe to Julius, which I had just a day earlier. Same juicy flavors on the nose. However, unlike Julius where these orange and mango flavors are the star, in Haze the hops take center stage and the juice is the supporting cast. Same great unfiltered look and lovely mouth feel exist here as well. Very nicely done."
"Not usually a big fan of IPAs or IIPAs because they are so often bitter more than anything else. This had plenty of lush citrus flavours, good acidity, and lush mouthfeel to balance out a surprisingly modest bitter finish. I could drink this and Heady any day of the week with no complaints."
"Easily my favorite Tree House IIPA. It has the unmistakable Tree House creaminess and amazing smell when you pop a fresh can. Juicy, but less bitter than their other IIPAs. Definitely tastes better after a week or two like most canned hops, IMO."
L - hazy light orange 
"Another superior Tree House offering. A little less fruity and a little more hoppy at the end than Julius or Alter Ego. Has that cloudy honey-orange color that announces that unfiltered goodness is on the way. Fantastic nose - mango, citrus, touch of pine. Taste says tangerine and pine to me with some softer fruits. Strong hops bitterness follows. Mouth feel - nice carbonation, then soft flow over the tongue, finishes with a lingering bitterness. Fruit flavors emerge more as beer warms a bit. Nice, appropriate carbonation. "
A: Pours a hazy (wait a minute....just got the name!) dark golden color with a one finger fluffy cream colored head. 
Can into tulip. 2/10/16 all in my brain. 
"16oz can poured into a tulip on the same day it was canned, 2/10/16"
Had this for the first time. It won't be the last. Got better as I got to the bottom of the can. Great feel on the mouth. You could really taste the hoppy juiciness of the this beer.
"Drinking side by side with a king Julius, and its damn near as good!!! Very similar, just less tropical and a tad bit more hoppy. This is of course a world class DIPA, but even near the top of that group!"
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"Another fantastic IPA from Tree House. I would put this citrus juiciness above Alter Ego, but below Green and Julius. Still, it's just one more reason that Tree House is killing it right now."
Canned three days prior to tasting.
"Pours the typical hazy Tree House burnt orange color. Foamy white head dissipates but a small amount lingers throughout. Intricate lacing riddles the glass. Smell is bursting with orange, citrus, peach, dank earth, malt. Taste reflects the same with the malt/hop balancing nicely with all those tropical, soft flavors. Extremely smooth mouthfeel to go along with it's other TH IPA counterpart. Another hit from the good folks at Tree House"
From growler. Is this beer or orange juice? Moderate retention but a dollop of lingering foam. Spattered lacing. Millions of peaches. That's the smell I get first. A bit of earthy dank and oranges. Passion fruit starburst taste. But the mild earthiness keeps it in check from total juice bomb. Hint of pine. Nice wet feel. Mild carbonation and a bit of zest. Another great beer from TH.
Appearance: THe cloudy goldstraw colored liquid builds as the bubble show recedes but the resultant head is well over two fingers thick; great retention and gobs of splashy lace
Canned: 1/27/16 
"Maybe the juiciest Tree House IPA I've had so far. I get orange, tangerine, tropical fruit, and peach with very little bitterness or malt. There is a slightly dank pine flavor but its not overpowering. The mouth feel is light and clean yet soft and fluffy. I was expecting this one to be a little bigger than the other Tree House IPAs and it really doesn't stand out in that way, but its very enjoyable and well worth the cost of trading."
AMAZING IIPA! If I were stranded on an island and had only one beer to take with me this would be it!
Poured from can
"A full flavor DIPA with a variety of hoppy flavors. It's not the best DIPA in New England, but it's close."
"A- Pours just like the rest of the Tree House IPA's, hazy as hell and bright to boot. This time, the color is a bright, light orange to almost peach or apricot in color. A smaller head forms and retains for a bit, but only laces a little bit. Overall impression in the glass is that it looks a lot like a mimosa at a Sunday brunch."
"Aroma is tropical heaven. Gushes out of the glass with citrus galore along with intense peach. Flavor follows suit with a bitterness level that teeters on the edge of scary, then brings you right back with just a touch of a bready malt backbone. This my favorite TH IPA between it, Julius, and Green. Stunning."
One of the best double ipa s out there. Gotta get this if you have never tried it.
"I rarely give a beer a perfect rating. Drank this side-by-side with Julius, Green, and Alter Ego. This was my favorite. Juicy, dank, everything you could want out of a DIPA. Seek it out."
"Wow, this was an excellent beverage. Hazy, orange juice like color, smell is citrus with an undertone of dankness. Taste follows suit, with a nice juicy explosion with pine. As expected with an imperial, a slight alcohol presence just enough to let you know it's a double but not overpowering. I need more of this in my life."
"A hoppy part of a large tasting session, appearance is a cloudy, light, brown, pours two fingers of creamy head that retains very well, the look is exactly what you come to expect of tree house hoppy beers, Smell is super juicy, tropical fruit notes with a solid malt backbone and a slightly floral quality. Taste is just like the smell, very fruity, apples, peaches, pineapple and mangos are all there, balanced by a biscuity, malt backbone and just a touch of grassy earthiness. Texture is light but very creamy with medium carbonation, very juicy."
Received this as part of a trade from BA MVB1121. Making a point to review it after having it last time and loving it so much that I didn't want to take the time to write down my notes. Poured out of a tallboy that was canned on 11/24/15 and enjoyed just shy of a month on 11/24/15. Poured into a pub-style pint glass.
"Pours a (forgive me) ""hazy"" yellow gold color with a medium sized white head... nice lacing. Smell is that of peaches (!), mango, pine, and dank hops. Taste follows the nose, nice balance of hops and pine, and the most peach I have ever tasted in a beer. I was so caught off guard it took me a couple sips to figure out what I was tasting. Mouthfeel is that of a juicy, pretty thick for an IPA body, with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall this is an excellent DIPA, that incorporates flavors not commonly used in that style."
Near perfect IPA in my opinion. My favorite IPA today. Amazingly drinkable and be careful because it's a double IPA. Just the right amount of citrus.
"Dank, tropical hops jump out of the glass both in the nose and the taste.. just fantastic beer once again from Tree House.. You often find breweries that make great IPAs or great stouts but not both.. Tree House is truly a do no wrong brewery IMO.. Love this and lover Tree House.. Highly recommended."
WOW.....First Tier IPA
This is my favorite among the IPA's that Tree House produces. The thickness of the beer itself let's you capture the complex flavors.
Canned 11-24-15
"Holy sweet mother of of Jesus, this beer is freaking delicious. Thanks to my friends dad, I was able to enjoy some of this sweet nectar fresh out of the growler. The only bad thing about this beer (subjective) is that it is dangerously drinkable. I could have easily drank half of the growler in one sitting."
"Great beer, nice biscuit malt/not sweet, explosive tropical hop flavors but I found the beer missing points in the mid palate, not perfectly balanced hence the slightly lower score."
16 oz can poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"Poured 12/5/15 from a 750ml growler that was filled at the brewery on 11/27/15, into an imperial pint glass."
"L - Classic hazy, golden orange with two fingers of white head"
"L: As the name implies, its a cloudy/hazey IPA. Bright (burnt) orange color with golden glow on the edges. Starts with a white silky head that settles down. Very appealling and sexy on the eyes."
Can't beat the feel of a Tree House beer. This one has a very strong odor of nail polish remover though. Blame it on the hip hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop.
Look: Hazy orange gold 
11/25/15 dated can. Finally having this one again after over a year.
Appearance: Hazy peachy gold. Head is bright-white and super creamy. Sheets and big sticky notches of lacing coat the glass . Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Consumed 11/25/15
I think I may have found a favorite new DIPA.
"Pours a glowing hazy pale orange color. Has an intense tropical fruit aroma. Has notes of citrus an resin. Flavor is bright, citrusy, papaya. Has a slightly bitter and crisp finish. Leaves a really nice aftertaste. Overall this is delicious!"
DANK.... Unlike Julius this one has a better balance of bitterness. True TreeHouse IPA. Haze is IMO there best offering to date.
The best
Perhaps the most unbelievable beer I have ever tasted!
"juice bomb!! pours the haziest orange, resembles mixing fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice together. smell is juice, citrus, oranges, clementines, with a sweetness at the end. taste follows the smell perfectly, giant juice bomb. no apparent alcohol taste. feel is perfect, a little thick but it is a double IPA. awesome brew from Tree House! close second to Julius in my opinion."
"This beer is yet another slam dunk from Tree House. Massive citrus aromatics: orange, grapefruit, some pineapple, and ripe peach. Hop bitterness is a little more dank and pronounced than some of their other beers, it definitely drinks a little ""bigger"" than beers like Julius and Green. Malts have a caramel quality to them which increases the richness."
Ridiculously smooth
"Pours a murky orange that really resembles some type of dark orange juice. The nose is full of stone fruit, mangoes, pineapple and citrus. The body is sweet with a light pine presence and a restrained bitter finish. Another slam dunk from Tree House!"
"Can dated 10/30/15, imploring to ""Drink Me Now!""; drank in a Tree House teku on 11/6/15; just an incredible 8.2% DIPA"
Poured from a pounder into a tulip glass:
Look - Straight orange juice! The typical TH haze. Their beers are absolutely amazing looking in the glass. 
This beer is one of my favorites from treehouse (which lets be honest anything out of treehouse is my favorite) super citrusy with a punch. Canned today so fresher than the prince of bel air.
"The beer has a super hazy orange color. The aroma is grassy and vegetal. The taste is grassy, vegetal, bubblegum, almost a paint-like quality, and has a clean finish."
Amazing! It's a party in your mouth
"16 oz can. Pour turbid orange, thick fluffy head fades slowly leaving lace and clumps of foam on the surface. Huge citrusy orange nose. Taste follows with sweet orange and tropical fruit, delicious. The hops on this one don't hit until very late in the sip, strong but not unpleasant grapefruit peel and touch of pine. The hops become bitter well after the swallow. Semi dry finish and soft medium mouthfeel. Another outstanding IPA by Tree House, late hops linger a bit long but way good."
16 oz. can from the source poured into a snifter 2 days after canning.
"Great tasting american double IPA. From the first smell you can smell the citrus and fruit explosion before putting the glass to mouth. It pours a hazy yellow with a one inch head. The flavor has more hop punch that Julius or Alter Ego, but doesn't make the beer any less smooth. Another great Treehouse Brew."
"Dangerously drinkable for the abv. Mango, papaya citrus bomb. There is such a balance for a double Ipa and it's not overly bitter. Soft on the palate which belies the amount of hops and strength of the brew. Awesome."
Haze is one of the best ipa's coming out of tree house. It's a nice mix of blends and hops. It enhances the spiceness of food and a great stand alone beer. Try it with some spicy foods to enhance the food such as papaya salad or spicy wings.
It doesn't get much better then this for a dipa!
"It pours a dull, hazy/murky orange. Very thin head. It wasn't overly aromatic. There is some light malt sweetness on the front end, but it is the dank, grapefruit and earthy, spicy hop presence that plays the greatest role. A soft mouthfeel, which I've found typical of Tree House hoppy concoctions. This is a very good DIPA."
just an incredible beer.....pours a nice orangish color.....smooth feel with a hint or orange and peach.....doesn't have any bitter taste and no aftertaste. One of my favorite beers of all time!!
"Smooth, fruity, hidden alcohol, mild bitterness, soft landing. Dangerously quaffable."
"Received a few cans in a local trade. Poured into a TH teku glass. Pours a orangish color with moderate, white head. Smells of tropical citrus, hops, passion fruit; tastes are pretty close to smell... slight bitterness but no booziness detected. The mouthfeel has slight carbonation, medium body, ABV is hidden well. Overall a very tasty offering from Tree House Brewing. It is super drinkable and amazing DIPA. Cheers!"
16 oz can poured into a Tree House goblet. Pours a turbid hazy orange with serious citrus nose. Basically the higher abv more hopped up older brother of Julius. Still drinks like a lower abv brew with amazing mouthfeel and a ton of citrus hops and juicy deliciousness. Wish I had more than a few cans!
"Thanks to jakehoodlum for this 16 oz. silver can, in that seemingly east coast minimalist slap-a-label on a can blank style. Drunking by myself in a hotel room, working, watching the Twins, wild-card bound!"
"Poured from a can dated 9/16 into my Gandhi-Bot snifter glass tonight, 9/21. Thanks Andrzej! Looks amazeballs, orange with a deep cloudy opaqueness, frothy head leaves great lacing. "
"Pour - dark gold ""hazy"" color with fast receding white head"
Received this bad boy as an extra. Poured into a teku glass.
Got this one in a nice IP trade. Hope it's good! 16 oz. can into a tulip.
Poured from a can three weeks old into a pint glass
Canned about two weeks ago. Tulip glass.
The finish on this beer is really unique. Tropical fruit on blast. For me at least that's why I love this one.
"As the name suggest it pour hazy into the glass with a orange hue. Very thick head forms right away and dissipates slowly. The aroma is of pine and tropical fruits. There is no indication that it's 8.2%. It's very drinkable with pine, orange peal and a bit of malt in the finish. Outstanding DIPA."
"Cloudy in appearance. Nice slightly tropical bouquette, but I did not pick up much tropical flavor."
Rating # 1400
"This is a review from memory I will update when I have it fresh again. Poured from a 16 oz can a few weeks ago. Pours a beautiful hazey gold with a fluffy white head. Smells of tropical fruit, citrus and hibs. Taste of tropical hob juice! Wow! Fantastic beer I can't wait to get it again!"
32oz Growler shipped to Nebraska!
One mighty tasty brew with a cool name . Thi s and green are my favorite . Pours hazy and the name implies . Tropical like much of treehouse brews.
"Another solid offering from Tree House. Light, fluffy hop profile. Super bright, tropical hop bit, but with no bitter finish; typical of the new east coast style."
Personal favorite beer.
"Pours rich and chalky orange with a one finger head. Smells of candied fruits, floral with peppery notes and a good heap of citrus. Taste is an initial juice bath of pungent of tropical fruits, almost tart, with peppery bitter hops. Balanced so nicely for a double. Finishes dry and leaves some hop flavor behind. Frothy, soft mouthfeel. Overall a really excellent double IPA that can hold its own with just about anything. Tree House has a real excellent treat in Haze."
"No date, assumed it was fresh. Pours a light golden color and was the clearest beer I have had from TH. Balanced and very smooth for an 8% DIPA. As always, they don't dissapoint"
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. One week after canning sale at Tree House brewery.
"Poured from 16oz can into a Teku. Crisp hazy golden color with zero transparency. Nice lingering one finger head. Smells of pine and mango. Taste is fantastic, has that east coast IIPA feel but very easy on the finish. Overall another great beer from Treehouse."
"Pour is light golden amber with lots of fluffy white head and a decent lacing. Nose is huge grapefruit rind, really rindy musk, light grain profile, clean. Flavor is the same, a little less of the rind, more tropical, very low bitterness, light body, softer carb."
Can from the most recent release. Tried this and Curiosity 20 in the same night and Haze was the winner. Just a tremendous double IPA. I've yet to have a hoppy beer from Tree House that hasn't been excellent.
16 oz can poured into a shoe.
Look - Poured into Teku glass from 750ml. Golden Haze with a nice head and lacing.
Great american double ipa. Goes down super smooth. Has an addictive taste to it as you drink it
Updated review: 
Bomber poured into antique pilsner glass
"poured into teku from growler filled on 7/30/15 at Tree House Brewing. Pours the color of orange pulp with an enormous frothy white head. Lacing is abundant. Smell is a blast of orange rind, sweet pineapple, grapefruit with a slight piney note as well. Taste is a bit bitter up front but the citrus notes take over quickly, some breadiness from pilsner malt(?) peeks in there and then fades into a slightly bitter finish. Feel is medium with no signs of the 8.2ABV at all. Another deliciously beautiful beer from Tree House. Can they do anything wrong?"
"Poured from a 2 liter growler poured at the brewery 4 days ago. This is one fantastic DIPA. Honestly I just haven't had a bad beer yet from these guys, but Haze is such. Well balanced DIPA. Very citrusy, fruit bomb full of flavor and smooth as hell, with a little bit of bitterness on the back end. But that's ok and too be expected from the style. I don't enjoy DIPAs that are too malt forward or too bitter, but this is neither. Just a great example of this style and a beer that I will come back to at every opportunity that I get."
"Picked up six cans at the brewery. Hints of grass in smell and taste. Nice, but comes up 3rd behind green and Julius as far as Tree House offers."
"A: Like most of the treehouse brews, perfect. Nice and pale yellow cloudyness good head, and lacing down the glass."
"Slightly spicy pine nose, tastes of lemon, orange zest, papaya, and peach with a bitter pine finish. Not quite on the level of Green or Julius but this ones up there, could be most breweries best beer. That characteristic depth of hop flavor is mind bogglingly good"
Tree house is doing it right! Best brewery by far!
"Pint can into a shaker glass. Pours, erm, hazy. "
"This is a booze laden beast; it's dangerously smooth, and like many TH beers, it's loaded with juiciness. One 16 ouncer will put you into a Haze, but two might knock you on your butt. Great balance of alcohol and taste. A winner in my books. Find this beer now, if you haven't already."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange color with a huge white frothy head. The odor is IPA, grapefruit, orange, apricot, pineapple, peach, resin, slightly spice, slightly honey, pine like, malty, berry, slightly grassy. The taste is fruity, orange, pine, peach, not very bitter, a little grassy dry on the back end."
"Orange zest and stone fruits on the nose. Really balanced. Drinks smoothly for a double IPA. Had a tone of excellent IPA's recently (OH and HT, Lunch), but this definitely stood out."
So beautiful and delicious. A perfect example of the style. Dank Dank Dank. 'Enjoy by' on crack with the east coast touch. Tastes of resiny dank tropical fruit. Probably the best DIPA Ive ever had.
Easy drinking for 8.2% abv
These guys know how to make beer.
"since i rated Julius a 5 , i can only rate this a 5, but this is even more lucious and delicious than Julius. these guys are amazing."
"Another juice bomb from tree house. Crazy amount of tropical fruits jammed into this one. I am absolutely in love with this one. Pours translucent yellow, smells of (you guessed it) a ridiculous amount of fruit. Tastes as it smells, amaxing. Tons of juice up front with a nice bitter hop bite at the end. Wonderfuly done. Mildly carbonated very fluffy mouyhfeel. Delightful double ipa. Will buy every chance I get"
Poured from a 64oz. Tree House Brewing growler into a new Tree House stemmed snifter glass.
"As the name suggests pours a hazy brownish orange with a half inch fluffy white head. Taste was orange, grapefruit, light sugar, mild bitterness. Very drinkable, with a nice balance. This was a very solid beer."
"This didn't have any flaws, but it also didn't have a big personality. Great beer, but falls a bit short of the hype."
16oz can poured into a Snifter.
"Enjoyed multiple tall boys canned within a couple weeks and the same goddamn day. Deep dank and citrusy aroma accompanies the murky golden pour. Heavy notes of orange, grapefruit, mango and papaya are followed by a sticky, bitter wave that combines to create an incredibly tasty double IPA. Just the slightest hint of alcohol adds a little heat to the proceedings. As is Tree House's trademark, the beer leaves you with a creamy and crisp impression. Big flavors, soft body. World class DIPA."
Poured from a 16oz can into a tree house snifter. Purchased this past week. 
Another perfect example from Tree House
"Decent enough tasting honey colored beer, but for being a double IPA and over $4 a can I was disappointed in the lack of fullness and real double IPA laden tastes."
"Look: Nice, one finger head, nice lacing"
Great IIPA here.. almost too smooth. Love this juice-
WOW. There is no other way to describe this beer other than WOW. Sooooooo juicy.
Consumed directly from a 16 oz. can.
"As I crack the can, the delightful aroma of ripe passion and tropical fruit fills the air, mango, guava, papaya, with a bit of stone fruit. The pour yields a slightly turbid golden-orange with a fluffy white head."
"Fantastic, not much nose. Great balance"
Dull and bitter. Bland malt and excess sugar. Not sure what's up with this because it's not what I was expecting!
"Pours a hazy orange color, not unlike every other TH IPA. This is not a knock."
"Pours a hazy straw color. The smell is heavy with orange, sweet fruit, and a bit of pine. The taste follows the nose. Big tropical fruit tastes with a slight bitter finish. An amazing IIPA"
"Enjoyed from a 16 oz. can that was poured into a Tree House tulip. A citrusy hop bomb that's so smooth you can't really tell that it's an Imperial IPA. It has a lot of similarities to Julius, but it's not quite as balanced. A real treat to drink and certainly better than the vast majority of IPAs you will find on your local retailer's shelves. If Monson, MA is within driving distance, make the trek. Otherwise, add it to your ISO trading list. Delicious."
"L - a bright, clementine juice. No gradient. Solid floury hue throughout that looks gorgeous in the light. "
A excellent double IPA. It has a wonderful hoppy flavor with a the taste of citrus from start to finish. The aftertaste is slighly bitter but smooth. Very refreshing and tasty.
"A: Not like the purp, but hazy peach fuzz with burst of orange in color. Nice enough ivory head and good lacing."
thanks steve. enjoyed from a treehouse taster. murky yellow spotty lace. nose and taste is big time nectarine. kilin it. little boozy but awesome
"Another gem by TH, boy can these guys do no wrong??? Citrus bomb in a can...extremely crisp/refreshing...extreme hops added to this one! Great stuff!! Tropical notes galore!"
"A - Pours a hazy, cloudy medium to dark tan orange color, thin lacing ring, light carbonation."
"It's amazing beer advocate changed the rating system. Now, only ratings That come with a review of 150 characters will count. They've now just discounted thousands of ratings just because they want ""quality"". Well guess what, you now have a smaller sample size and beers with only 159 ratings are cracking the top 20. So stupid. It's 2015, people are busy. I don't want to spend 10 minutes describing my feelings about every beer I drink!"
"mango, pineapple, fresh cut hay? extremely fresh and clean, a wonderful experience drinking this."
"Very good brew. Initially was not impressed, but as I got further into the beer I really became a fan."
"A: Bright shade of orange (apricot), hazy with a thin white lacing."
Special thanks to Gmr75 for this outrageous extra!
From a fresh growler filled 4/17/15. truly fastastic to all the senses!!!
"This beer poured out as a Haze(d) golden color with a nice white head on top. The smell of the beer is very hoppy. Lots of fruity tropical aromas. The taste of the beer is much like the nose, lots of hops flavors in here. The feel of the beer is very smooth. Overall this beer is great, just like all the other Tree House beers."
"serving was out of a 750ml growler to pint glass, day after bottling. (bottled april 17th 2015)"
"Tree House has perhaps the most loyal fan base of any brewery I have visited, so at times it is difficult to gauge how good their beers actually are when you finally brush aside the hype and taste the beer for yourself. "
"My post-EBF treat. Bottled March 5, 2015."
Growler was poured into a nonic glass. 
"Pours a murky light apricot color (just say no to clear beers!)... smell of citrus and tropical fruits... taste of pine, resin, and citrus, with a-currently-indescribable fruity aftertaste- maybe kiwi?, and a mild bitterness Very tasty and addicting!"
"Yes, this beer is as close to perfect as a beer can be. This is heaven in a glass."
"The aroma is subdued. I get slight notes of orange and citrus bitterness, but it's quite boozey. This is not my favorite by Treehouse."
"Another home run from treehouse. As the name suggests, this pours a very cloudly hazy yellow/orange. Decent head and the smell is fresh grass and some citrus. One of the more drinkable beers out there. Taste is similar to the smell, almost refreshing."
Thanks @mikeyv35 for sharing your bottle!
"Piney, citrusy, sticky resins, but surprisingly delicate. Very good."
"True to it's name this beer is hazy in the best possible way. Tropical fruits explode from the glass and the abv is completely hidden. Rounded out by the typical tree house mouthfeel, full and soft."
750ml THB swing-top bottle filled at the brewery.

"16 oz can from recent batch. Poured into a TH tulip. Hazy golden orange color with an off white head. Beer is opaque. Cannot see through it at all. Smell of mosaic hops is there but this smells off a bit. Almost a musty smell mixed in with the mosaic. Flavor is also not right with this. Almost tastes watered down. The mosaic seems muted and not very pronounced. Feel is creamy as all TH beers tend to be. Overall, good not great. This recent can is quite the disappointment."
750 ml bottle bought at the brewery Oct. 4.
"Thanks SuperHop18. 750ml growler dated October 31, 2014. Pours a hazy straw with a thin quickly dissipating head. Tangerine and peaches on the nose, this is one great smelling DIPA! Slightly bitter citrusy up front with a touch of dank. Finishes dry. Medium body with light carbonation. Overall, this a well balanced, supremely crafted IIPA. Good job Tree House."
The beer comes in an opaque rich rich golden orange. Absolutely beautiful.
Was lucky to have this at Tree house on 7/19/2014 on the first day it was ever released.
"Picked up a couple of bottles of Haze from brewer Dean at Tree House. Sent one out to my fellow members of the Chicago Beer Snobs in Chicago, and shared the other with my brother yesterday. This is not only a great brew, but one that is extremely drinkable. Don't know if we are correct, but we tasted a little bit of peach maybe. The alcohol does not present itself, stays well hidden. I know Dean hangs with our Vermont brewers at Lawson's and Hill Farmstead, and I can say from the quality of this brew he well deserves to hang with those guys. Great brew, hard to come by; but if you are in Central Mass area seek it out. Congrats Dean...."
"750ml swing-top, purchased today, into a Tree House Teku."
Just got and drank batch #6 of Haze. Each batch is a little different - they use different hops.
Growler shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul. The beer is in fact hazy. Loads of citrus character. Dank hops and oranges. Tangy with a subtle sweetness. Mild bitterness and lingering citrus. Tasty.
750ml swingtop growler into a Founders snifter. 
750ml growler poured into a Bell's snifter 8/15/2014.
"On draft at the brewery. Tropical fruit hop juice. Creamy feel. Perfectly balanced. Mango, papaya, pineapple and orange. Creamy, light and pillowy feel. Fairly dry finish. Real good."
"25 oz. growler served in a nonic (thanks Joe). Bottled 7/12/14. Pours a translucent straw gold with a tight, 1/2 inch, bright white head. Head eventually dissipates into a consistent skim. Some lacing present, but poor adherence for the most part. Nose expresses bright citrus notes, a hint of ethanol and something else, perhaps herbal or oniony; it's hard to tease out. Citrus in the flavor profile is just as bright and akin to tangerines or clementines, with a mild hops bittering at the finish to break up the sweetness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation and some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Texture is slightly oily. Overall, another exceptional beer from Treehouse. I just wish they were closer."
"A-A thin, white head grows and dies before my eyes. Clearish body is bright honey in color. Almost zero lace."
"Apperance - Bright orange in color, 2 fingers of white head, crystal clear with streaming bubbles."
"First time I've had this in a while - still one of my favorites - obviously juicy, great body and carbonation, just enough bitterness and malt - not too much funk like many NEIPAs."
"A - Poured into a Tree House Teku, pours a golden/orange color with a moderate white, nice retention and light lacing."
"Growler filled yesterday, shared with rudzud and threelions."
"Visited the Tree House brewery tonight. Was a very welcoming, enjoyable visit."
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
Dark straw or light amber very cloudy appearance with significant white head that eventually disipates. Ate ma is a mild citrus. Taste is a nice grapefruit citrus.
"one of the best looking beers ive encountered. moderately hazy golden orange color with bright white head that leaves insane amounts of lacing, each sip is a ring on the glass. aroma and palate is grapefruit, grassy green herbaceous note, resinous pine, bready and sweet malts - honey and caramel predominate, some hints of orange and citrus peel. overall this was an enjoyable brew, cheers!"
Fresh growler drank on 7/18/2017
This may be the best beverage I've ever tasted! Velvet on the tongue. Dank on the nose. Smooth down the gullet. Hoppy in all over the previous. LOVE IT!!
"First time trying Ephraim, poured from growler 1 day after being filled into tulip glass. Opaque hazy golden color, decent head, retention, and lacing. Tropical fruity nose and taste, and smooth full mouth feel. Easily in the same league as Abner, Susan, and SS 4&5. Outstanding!"
"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a semi-hazy almost burnt orange color with a thin wisp of a white head that quickly dissipated. Light bubbles of broken head float around the top. Light wispy lacing. The smell takes in sweet danky onion sliding on into through resinous pine and then a light grapefruit underneath. The taste had a full bittersweet flavor revolving around the resinous piney part. Dry resinous aftertaste leads into a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. ABV, whoah, where did that go? Its not really there, well hidden. Overall, wow, just wow, just an absolutely stellar job by HF. I’d love to have this again."
This was malty for my tastes and for most HF hoppy beers. Felt more like a west cost IPA with the malt and pine characteristics. One of my least favorite HF hoppy beers.
"Very creamy IPA. Nice hops golden color, hoppy, piney and floral smells coming off one this one. Hazy orange color. Love the light creamy fluffy feel on this one."
"This one struck me as a little bitter at first, but I ended up really enjoying it as I went on. The combination of hops in this one works very well, making it another solid DIPA from HF."
"I don't generally love hoppy beers that are over 8.5% because they're too heavy and sweet, and this one is just those things. Hill beers have unrivaled mouthfeel and elegance, and this is just overdone. Intended I'm sure, given that it's 10%, but I'd take most of the Hill single and double IPAs over Ephraim."
Poured from a 750 growler into a snifter. Thanks Rich for hooking me up with this.
"L: Clear amber, white head to a ring. It's fine, but not what I love."
"Sampled pour from a fresh 32 oz growler That indicated Amarillo hops were highlighted. Pours bRight, nearly lemon yellow and slightly hazy with a solid 2 fingers of dense head. Nose is lemongrass combined with grapefruit and a hint of bubblegum sweetness. The taste presented the sweet fruitiness apparent on the nose but was beautifully balanced by resinous hop bitterness. This is definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"Expecting a bit more from this one. I expected the booziness given the 10% ABV but seem to be lacking in the aroma department. I enjoyed Abner earlier this week much more. Nonetheless, this is still a great beer. HF continues to produce high quality beers."
"Big, beefy DIPA with a huge ABV that drinks incredibly easy. Hoppy, piney and floral aroma; taste of orange rind, mandarin orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, tobacco and green tea. Outstanding citrus and bitter profile with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a balanced beer - it's a big time hop-forward DIPA that comes on strong and doesn't let up. With a 10% ABV I'm not sure what else you could expect. Prepare your face. They've employed magic to make such a huge beer so palatable."
Touch boozy. So many better HF beers out there.
"So. Damned. Creamy. The dextrose bumps up the body but doesn't make it syrupy. The appearance is pretty much perfect; bright auburn, perfect carbonation, sticky lacing. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate the taste and aroma. Maybe some tangelo and sweeter citrus. Though far from my favorite HF hoppy beer, it's ne of the best triple IPAs I've had. My heart still belongs to Notorious though."
"The beer comes in a pale amber, medium haze."
Loved his brew! Waited forever to track it down but was able to sue to solid trading partners!!! :). Shared from a fresh 750 with friends. Excellent beer and tons of hops! Still pretty smooth but you can tell the abv is rather high
"The hallmark of HF beers is restraint, sophistication and a flawless execution. Ephraim is a bit peculiar by this standard. It is a bit too boozy, bitter and big. Distinctly lacking in those great tropical fruit/floral notes that the best HF hoppy beers have. I suspect another reason this is slightly disappointing is that the IPA game has consistently upped the bar since Ephraim stepped on the scene. Not a bad beer, but also not up to the considerable hype either."
Poured from a growler filled on 2/13/16 into a Hill Farmstead stem glass.
"Pours an opaque orange, light carbonation, one finger head. Smells zesty, with a pilsner-like malt, herbal. Taste is hugely big and bitter. Spicy, dry and intense. This is a real hop bomb. At least... there isn't much else you can taste through all the IBUs. Leaves your mouth feeling dry and sort of wrecking the palate. It's not that this beer is bad -- it's not. It's just SO hop forward that it'll likely only appeal to hop heads looking to be blown away. Fine for an IPA drinker, but not especially impressive."
"A great double IPA here. Real nice tropical nose, lots of citrus forward smells. The taste follows the nose- pineapple, mango, with a slight bitter finish. Wanted to try this for a while. Did not disappoint."
"On tap. Not hazy like their other beers. Not clear, but I can actually see bubbles. Stellar lacing as always. Great clean smell. Pine. Bitterness. Taste is similar. No real fruit presence. Just a classic hop bitter. Imperial and assertive. That bitter keeps growing but I like it. Feel is smooth carbonation. Just the right amount. Super sticky as well. Different than what I'm used to from these guys. Still very good."
"Hazy orange color. Smell is a subtle pony hops with some malt. The taste is an earthy hops with good malt background. A very smooth yet hearty feel. No double galaxy, but still a to notch beer."
L: Bright golden hues reminiscent of barley straw with a 0.5cm soapy white head; copious amounts of lacing around the glass
"Pours a translucent gold with soapy white head. Some sweetness in the aroma. There is a lot of sweet malt up front. Like a fruit snack base sweetness. The piney hop finish arrives on the end, providing some nice complexity. The mouthfeel is thin though, which kind of takes away from that for me. Overall, this is a beer I would have killed for 3-4 years ago. Now, it's just a good imperial IPA."
"This beer was described as the be-all and end-all of beers, so it was disappointing to finally try this beer and not have it live up to hype. "
"After not being blown away by Abner and hearing some negative reviews, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. But this one definitely lived up to the hype! What stood out to me is the perfect balance between the pine and citrus hop characteristics and the way the ABV is hidden so well. This is up there with Triple Sunshine among the best DIPA's I've ever had and certainly the best TIPA I've ever had, if you want to consider it in that category. Worth seeking out for sure!"
Another fine brew from HF. Enjoyed on tap at Ambulance brewhouse. Nice light golden color. Very typical VT - DIPA. Very fruity and just so - so smooth. Easy to drink and hides its ABV very well. Could drink quite a few of these which is a little dangerous.
"Really orange and bright producing over an inch of head, holy crap, when you smell how amazing this is, you'll be even more impressed that the appearance can produce that head and retain it so well. "
One of the smoothest and most fantastic beers I have ever had!
From old review (4/11/13) at Farmhouse.
"This one is magical, should be more sought out that Heady or Double Sunshine, but it is made so few times a year that it doesn't touch either on this list. This is one the best beers I have every tried, easily in my top 10 beers... "

"Simply said, this is as close to perfect an imperial IPA you can ask for. From the aromatic piney esters, to the cirtrusy flavors, to the soft round mouth feel, to the dry finish. This is simply outstanding. The only negative is the exclusivity that makes this hard to get. I'm sad that I may not have it again."

"One of the best Hill Farmstead beers in my opinion. The beer is a nice golden color with a good head retention. The smell is strong with hops.

"Doug generously bought this growler to share with me and Shaun #1 yesterday, 6/3/2013. Poured into a snifter."
"Pours a clear gold, some nice bubbles on the top, not too much head. Nice lacing. Smells great. Tropical fruit, honey dew melon. The taste is more bitter than the smell. Pine and citrus with a small alcohol burn. Lemon comes through well. It's a pretty easy drinker for 9%. Medium mouthfeel, smooth as creamy. Impressive for a high alcohol DIPA."
"After drinking this for the second time, it reaffirms that this beer is very similar in taste to Heady. I'd say Ephraim is a lot more bitter, a little less sweet and didn't have as good as a smell as HT. Not saying I prefer one to the other, it's just a different amazing beer drinking experience."
"Pour is hazy bright golden amber with tons of egg white head leaving a thick lacing. The nose is pungent, light clean grain, dusty, strong tropical fruits, mango and grapefruit behind. Taste also has nice balance with huge hop punch. The grain is up front, clean and lightly dusty. Hops surround with a creamy dough and more tropical fruit. Plenty of mango and fuzzy peach with a grapefruit hit in back and crisp bitterness with little lingering effect. Body is light, a touch creamy mid palate, softer carbonation in the finish."
Enjoyed this on draft at Three Penny Tap Room in Montpelier.

750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
"Growler from the brewery filled May 3, Chugged down May 7. From notes."
"Oh god this stuff is amazing. Had on tap several times in VT bars and at the brewery & it does not disappoint. Only downside (?) is the abv. Tough to drink more than a couple and make it through the night. The aroma is spectacular, and I truly think the only worthy alternative in the 10%+ IPA arena is PTY, which is similarly spectacular. Outrageously hoppy, but balanced as much as it can be with a malt backbone. Citrus, grapefruit and grassy hops are all over the aroma and flavor. A complex brew for sure, sort of an overhopped barleywine, but a class act in the IPA space. If you find it on tap or get a growler of it, do not succumb to letting it be your first beer of the night or you will be doomed. Finish with it when it cannot wreck your palate for whatever comes next."
Poured from a 750ml HF swing-top growler into HF over-sized wine glass. Growler filled at the brewery two days ago. I've had this beer multiple times from multiple batches but this is the first time writing a full review.
"Reviewing Ephraim from the Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro Bend, Vermont. This imperial pale ale is one of Hill Farmstead's most sought after non-bottled release. Major thanks to Fitz for helping me acquire this gem!"
"Pours a vibrant orange glow, slightly over one inch of head on it. Nose just erupts with the juiciest aromas of tropical and citrus fruits this side of Pliny, maybe even moreso. Its magnificent and owes nothing to nobody. Sliding in with the varied fruits are plenty of pine and soft lemon. Pineapple, pine, apricot, mango, you name it, its there. Yum. "

Fresh Ephraim from Saturdays Hill Farmstead harvest fest. What an outstanding festival run by Shaun and his crew. Best festival I have ever attended and not to mention I now get to enjoy this gem in syracuse.
"On-tap, served in a tulip"
"Picked this up at the Harvest Festival. Great time. 750ml poured into my shiney new Hill Farmstead steam wear. Murky orange / tangerine color with a white one finger head. Lots o' lacing. Tropical. Papaya, passion fruit, citrus zest. Bam, explosion, nothing more to say. Huge tropical flavor, pinapple, passion fruit, papaya, citrus zest, a little pith and pine resin. Hoppy bitterness lingers on the finish. The finish is dry and there is absolutley no way of detecting that this is 10.5% abv. Slightly more carbonation would be nice. Really they only downside to this beer is the appearance. Don't know how they did this."
"Poured from tap at the Harvest Festival into provided tulip/wine glass. Very very thick foamy white head sits on top of this straw hazey color. This smell is so fragrant you can smell it well before you bring it to your nose. Strong candied hop aroma, vanilla, and more more more sweet hops. Taste is amazing! Very well balanced malts and hops. Citrus, mango, cotton candy, and a hint of sweet vanilla. This is the best Double IPA I ever had..hands down. Highlight of the Harvest Fest for sure."
"On tap at the Harvest Festival. The most stinky and dank IPA I've had. Lots of onions, some earth, very farmhouse. Some citrus of course. The bitterness is higher than most Hill Farmstead. Not my favourite from Hill Farmstead but definitly interesting, unique and very tasty."
"750mL growler thanks to oteyj. Pours a clear amber with a modest white head. Looks very different from other samples I’ve had which looked glowin yellow. Nose here is pretty sticky, sugary, muted, candy, maple, orange, 3C hops. Decent. Taste up front is sticky with some very obvious booziness moving to vanilla and maple. But overall, sticky and resinous. Not vey fruity or tropical like I was expecting. Very different from the Double Citra. Good stuff, yummy, but nothing too exciting."

"Fresh from the keg @ Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro VT (Harvest Festival)."
Traded big for this one as well - a '11 DL for a 750ml growler of this good stuff straight from Hill Farmstead. Pours a fairly golden yet murky orange appearance. Fluffy white head that holds well a bit. Aroma is potent with mango citrus pine and grapefruit bitterness. Somewhat sweet candy like malt a touch alcohol to smell as well. Taste is a load of resionous pine citrus mango citrus rind bitterness. Candy-like sweet malt lets the hops shine through. Smooth mouthfeel that complements well to a rich full body DIPA. Really want to try the Double Galaxy!

Scent leads with big bitter pine resin before mellowing into a blend of citrus and tropical fruit (grapefruit, orange, pineapple, tangerine)... quite impressed. Taste follows suit, big and bitter upfront with pine and herbal hops, mellows quickly into a fruit cocktail like blend of citrus and tropical fruits, ends with a touch of tangy bitterness and light alcohol presence.

Note's from Captain Lawrence Rosso Batch 3 release / tasting:
"Massive thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one during the Growler Party this weekend! Served from growler into a Southern Tier tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one and a half finger very slightly off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and pot. The flavor was of sweeet malt, earth, citrus, citrus hop, and pot. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was just plain excellent. Not really any other way to say it. All of the aspects on this one just stood out to your senses to let you know that you were having a great beer. The aroma on this one was other-worldly for the style. You would have never known this was 10.5% at all, and I could see that getting a lot of people in a lot of trouble really easily. Really glad I finally got to tick this beast!"

Growler into a La Chouffe tulip; sampled at the Batch 3 Rosso release. Huge thanks to whoever brought this one to share.
Slightly cloudy appearance with two fingers of lacing on the glass. Aromas of citrus and lemon peel mingle nicely with a slight herbaceous character. Flavors of grapefruit rind and piney hops dominate this very hoppy brew. Sticky hop presence with nice body and a creamy mouthfeel lead to a finish showing some of the herbal components and the perfect amount of malt. With the abv on this it didn't come across hot at all and was a bit too easy to drink This one lived up to the hype and I can't wait to get my hands on this again as it blew me away from the first sip.
Review from notes taken on 4/23/11. On Tap at Capones served in a 6oz snifter. This brew appears a clear golden copper color that haze some hop haziness about it keeping it from being perfectly clear. There are some orange and yellowish hues about the brew when it is held to the light. A finger of white fluff holds decent across the top leaving webby and spotty lacework on the glass.
A: Golden orange body with nice clarity and a decent sized foamy cap. Good retention and solid lacing.

"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a one finger frothy white head that has good retention, slowly fading into a lasting ring. Sporadic chunks of lacing left behind."
"On tap @ the blind tiger during the Hill Farmstead event. I had this beer at extreme beerfest, but only one 2oz pour. Today two full 12oz glasses of this hoppy nectar. It poured a wonderful dark golden color, with pretty decent clarity considering it is unfiltered. Little head that faded pretty quick, not a ton of carbonation either. The nose was packed full of citrus deliciousness, pineapple and grapefruit mostly. The taste was more of a pine and grapefruit rind that finishes with an outstanding hop-bitterness. One of the best DIPA's i've had in a while, so lucky i was able to have more than one serving of this."
"This was just flat-out ridiculous. It reminded me only of one other beer, an old DIPA I made 5 years ago with 294.6 theoretical IBUs that was 9.5%. So this one was 280 theoretical IBUs and 10.5%. No heat, all face-fucking hops. Big nasty bitterness, and to all those who ""can't taste"" above 100 IBUs or don't know the difference, I'm sorry. Some can, if you can't, then oh well. But this was a big beautiful bitter. I've never had a commercial beer approach this level. The next closest would be Bitter Bitch from Astoria. "
Growler shared by Grant - much obliged!
Drank on Mar. 25th.
"Yet another overt thanks to a top-notch trader, baconsausage, who tossed this growler my way with no expectation of anything in particular in return. In turn, the growler was shared with a bunch of other BAs & non-BAs at an impromptu weekend tasting. Reviewed from admittedly sketchy notes. "
Thanks to xpimptasticx for the share! Served in an unmarked snifter.
"The third attempt at getting a growler was the charm, and the best part was I didn't have to give up anything insanely rare, just good beer!"
Picked up a growler yesterday when we made the 3.5 hour drive up.
Here is the DIPA that rocketed from unknown to superstar at breakneck speed. This has a lot of hype behind it and thus my expectations are appropriately very high. Now for the judgment. Poured into a snifter.
thanks much to urbancaver for sharing this
A-transparent gold with white whispy head
A. Pours clear orange with a two finger white head.
Thanks to Urbancaver for sharing this growler. 
Pours a nice clear yellowish orange. A beautiful golden colour with a bit of nice fine white head. Leaves a nice layer on the surface. Smells intensely hoppy. Lots of Sweet almost syrupy hop juice. Tastes very very hoppy. Lots of sweet pine and citrus. Tons of flavours going on. Vry smooth and drinkable. Amazingly drinkable. Overall a fantastic dipa.
"Big thanks to the most generous BA I know. Thanks man, I owe you big time! Growler shared amongst friends and consumed exactly 6 days after the growler was filled. "
"2L growler poured into a tulip. Big thanks to CharlieMurphy for this, props Nick! "
A: Pretty hard to pour from the otherwise cool looking growler. Yellow pour with hints of orange. Nice fluffy white head with decent retention and nice lacing.
"Growler shared by the king of growlers himself, drabmuh at a tasting in the woods. If drabmuh does not bring a growler to a tasting...something must be wrong with the world. "
The second of two growlers I picked up last weekend. 
Growler shared by drabmuh (the growler king). Thanks Matt!
From 03/19/11 notes. Big thanks to drabmuh for sharing this one; thanks Matt. Got to try a 2 oz. pour of this at EBF last week and loved it so was excited to get a bigger pour of it this time.
"Growler sent to me by baconsausage, thanks! Shared at a recent beer tasting that went from zero to epic in three minutes. Served in a Hill Farmstead becher glass (thanks bacon), because I am able to."
"Appearance: Hazy straw-amber-apricot-peach pour, good head and lacing"
Poured from a growler into a snifter. Thanks goes out to gn0sis for sending this my way. Split with airohead2001 and z-pack.
Big thanks to glazeman for this one. Winter is breaking in Chicago's western burbs. Bring on the sun. This beer is poured into a snifter from a bigass crazy looking growler.
"Shared by Phelps, which was won in Beer Puzzle IV. "
A: Fairly clear golden copper color. A little lighter than the usual DIPA. A finger of fluffy white head with great lacing. Definitely not filtered as there was some yeast floating in suspension.
Hooked up with this from Sonicwaveofbees.
brought by phelps to a tasting.
First of all a shout out to Ryan who traded for this growler so he could send it to me?!?
"Huge thanks go out to imagineiii for providing this growler as a prize in the fourth Beer Puzzle LIF. It was shared at a tasting of Arizona-bound beer lovers, and my particular pour was put inside a tulip. "
"Growler brought over by Michael, thanks!"
Thanks to John for sending me a growler of the most recent batch from early March 2011.
"Huge thanks to Todd for hooking me up with a growler of this. So far I've been a big fan of Shaun's IPAs, so I've been looking forward to trying this one."
Huge thanks to Andrewinski1 for making the trek down to Hill Farmstead to grab this one up. Dedication. Poured into a tulip. Beer pours a slightly hazy straw color with about a finger of white fluffy head. It retains nicely and eventually settles down a bit leaving thin soapy lace. 
Poured into a Hill Farmstead Glass. The color is a nice orangey gold color. A small white head is formed and leaves super sticky lacing.
Shared by Gonzoillini at a tasting. This was the first beer if the night. I was very excited to try it! 
"Big thanks to TCassell1 for this beer, a treat to have. Notes from 3-3-11"
Huge thanks to dreadnaught33 for sharing some of his growler last night.
"Finished writing an appellate brief from hell tonight, so thought I would reward myself with a couple of glasses of Ephraim. From a growler sent by a generous BA. Opened on 03.03.2011."
"This is a dangerous beer because of it's smoothness, balanced and big ABV. I can easily drink a few of these if not careful."
Review altered after 2011 EBF.
"Had on tap at the Farmhouse. Poured into a goblet tasting glass, hazy deep amber-gold body under a lacy white head. The hop smell wafts across the table: sweet, sappy, grassy and with a heavy dose of floral honey. Fresh and mouthwatering IPA smells."
"Growler- pours a light tangerine with slight haze with a light head and soapy lacing. Nose- huge blast of tropical fruit (mango, pineapple, passion fruit). Taste- WOW- intense, wave after wave of hops attack the senses. Citrus, pine resin. Thick chewy hops interplay with cookie dough pale malts. Medium bodied. Carbonation spot (esp for a growler I've been sitting on for a few weeks). Booze is not apparent other then a warming heat as this hop delivery vehicle slides down the throat. Its a man among boys in the world of dipas. Drinkability is insance for the power of this brew. World class"
On tap at the Farmhouse Tap and Grill. Served in a small tasting glass. A thin white head sits on top of a beautiful glowing orange body. Lots of sticky lacing left behind.
Shared a growler with two friend recently. Appearance is a golden dark yellow. The smell is simply outstanding. Great pine/citrus (grapefruit) smell. The best smelling east coast IPA I have ever had. The taste did not dissapoint. More hoppy than malty (which I like.) Mouthfeel was also excellent. Perfectly carbonated. 
"Growler. Pours a golden yellow amber color with a very white head that forms a nice 1 finger head of foam that false rather quickly. I can smell the hop aroma as I pour this out into the glass. Very aromatic with nice tropical type hop notes like pineapple and mango, also some citrus rind. Medium mouthfeel. Fruity malty sweetness gives way to a nice bitter hop bite. Wow, bitter bite, might be a tad much. Very slight alcohol notes but otherwise the alcohol is fairly well hidden."
Thanks to kbutler1 for sharing this one. 
"Thanks! A much anticipated first review from a much anticipated brewery. I'm new to Hill Farmstead brewery, but not to the beers of this brewer."
"Had a few pours from a growler thanks to Arbitrator. The growler apparently lost a few ounces of beer in transit, but that didn't seem to harm it much beyond a slight loss of carbonation."
"Finally a tick from Hill Fargstead! Growler (and hand bottle) shared by Arbitrator. Let's see see what these crazy homers are all yappin' about, shall we?"
Chilled growler into a glass. Thanks Kristin!
"Poured a nice caramel orange with a light white head of tiny bubbles. Smell of grapefruit citrus, caramel, sugar, cotton candy and well rounded as the sweetness and bitterness seem to equal each other. "
Thanks to Jason for procuring a growler of this highly regarded brew. Served in a Rodenbach tulip.
Thanks to jrallen34 for hooking us up with this. 
"3/6/2011 Re-review thanks to Chris. This is batch 2, drank from a counter-pressurized growler. This batch is more hot, way too much alcohol on the finish. Still pretty good, just not the epic level of the first batch, still recommend trying. "
"Growler, thanks Jason. "
Thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing this growler last night.
"Drank on-tap at the Blackback Pub & Flyshop, Waterbury, VT"
"Enjoying this brew with some friends to celebrate finishing up my first marathon. Courtesy of mymrrngjckt who received this from the brewer, I'm looking forward to trying this."
Was able to make it up to the Hill Farmstead release on sat last week and couldn't be more pleased with this find! Triple IPA...yes please! 
Had this in tap at their autumn festival and thought it was too hoppy for me. Got to sit down with it again a few days later and now I can see what the big deal is about. 
"Sampled this at the Autumn Harvest Festival. Now, it's time to review it."
Consumed numerous glasses of this at the Hill Farmstead Autumn Fest on Oct. 2nd.
"Appearance: Pours goldfish orange with honey folds. The crown is 1 finger deep, white in color, displays moderate retention and good lace."
Served at the autumn fest in Greensboro. Wine glass.
2l pop-top growler poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.
On tap at the brewery release today. Poured into a HF wine glass.
Appearance: Dark orange with a thin off white head.
"I sampled this on tap at the brewery on 9/24/10 and knew that I immediately needed to grab a growler. 2 liter ""genie"" shaped swing-top growler into an oversized tulip glass. "
"Mosaic shines incredibly well all over the ale, namely the aromas; the hops work well with lactose on the palate, plus some peach supporting it nicely in back; thick mouthfeel, with juicy, peach qualities lingering."
After an earlier other half beer where the lactose was overpowering I was ready for disappointment. Luckily this is spot on. Malt and hops work well together and that big hop flavour and aroma is well matched with the lactose.
I've been on an Other Half kick recently and it's really kind of all running together. 
"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn. "
Pours light orange with light head and nice lacing. 
Canned 6/27/18 (31 days ago)
Can received in trade
Thank you CanConPhilly for this 
My 2nd favorite Other Half brew. Mosaic comes through quite nicely but not overpowering. Great mouthfeel - smooth back end finish.
That is a beautiful IPA.....sweet floral hoppy goodness with damn near no bitterness!
Had on tap at the source
"This one pours a slightly hazy dark orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
Poured from a 16oz can into a speiglau IPA glass. 
"This beer pours a completely opaque, cloudy golden yellow color with a two finger, foamy, bright white head that eventually fades to a half finger cap that sticks around for the entirety of the beer. There are lots of sticky chunks and spots of lacing left all over the glass."
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; production date 01/17/18.
Tall can....1/17/18....damn right its fresh..3 days in the can
Dank as fuck
"Dark golden pour, massive head. Orange, mango nose, fairly sweet and a bit grassy. Dank up front, orange, tangerine peels, overripe mango, grass, papaya. Fairly sweet. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body. Quite nice."
had on 11 Dec 17. def one of my favorite other half IPAs. this is a top 5 ipa from them for me. mosaic overload in this is just amazing. they could release this every weekend and prob sell out.
"Awesome beer. Tons of citra hops, tropical fruits, fruity malts, mangos, and pineapples especially. Medium body and moderate carbonation but no bitterness. Well worth seeking out."
Pours very hazy golden / amber with white frothy head. 
"Had it on tap at Beer Shop, NYC. It pours a cloudy golden orange. The haze is reminiscent of an unfiltered NEIPA look. The head is foamy white and moderate, however, it soon dissipates. It leaves a thin ring of lace."
"From a 3-week-old can, pours a fully hazed deep orange. Thick lacing. Smell is bright tangerine, lemon and bubblegum. Taste follows. Fantastic smooth and drinkable feel. This is simply one of the best Mosaic beers I’ve had."
"L - Hazy, golden orange with two fingers of white head"
Huge flavors of tangerine and papaya. Absolutely incredible beer from OH. Not a single part of this beer disappointed and it now rests on my list of top beers. Definitely try this one if you get the chance!
"L - pours a deep, brooding, glowing orange. Like maybe 65% sunset territory. Looks real thick and creamy. Fluffy head that's cool whip on the bottom, and big, sticky bubbles on top that latch on to the glass and don't let go. "
"On tap at Haymaker, NYC, it pours cloudy orange color with a 1 finger foamy off white head that faded slowly and left very nice rings as it went down. It looked like a glass of guava juice."
"Another killer double dry hopped IPA from other half..flavors just popping like mad on this one..grapefruit, melon and grass are noticeable. Very smoth and the mouthfeel is very full and slick..nicely balanced hoos..fantastic beer"
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with thick white head. Aroma is lemon, orange, peach and melon. Very well balanced. Flavors of tropical fruits with some citrus and a little resin. Very well done imperial IPA"
I really think this is simply just solid. Not sure how you can improve it.
"Easily my favorite Double IPA to date. I was so blown away I went on a mission to verify if my taste buds were messing with me. I worked quickly to get fresh cans/bottles from RR, Melvin, Alchemist, Lawson's, Bissell Bros., Treehouse, Trillium, and Burial for a taste test, and I'm still satisfied in saying this Other Half offering is IMHO my favorite. Love this brewery!!"
"Dank mosaic hops all the way through in this one. Nice nose on it with the flavor following through. Medium mouthfeel. Nice offering, but not exceptional."
"pours out a hazed straw/gold, dense bright white head, good retention and some lacing. "
On tap at other half. The smell opens the palette and makes the drool start immediately. I had 5 4 oz pours in front of me and the smell immediatley drew me in. Glorious beer. Cant wait to pour my growler into a glass
Fresh 64 oz. growler.
"Pours like every other orange juice hazy #newmoney IPA, smells like Yellow Rose got beat up in a brooklyn alley (in a good way), pungent dank blueberry/strawberry juice. Other Half continues to KILL it."
"Pours a hazy deep golden straw. The head is so soft and pillowy. Some strawberry and honey dew melon on the nose. The first sip is like biting into sugarcane. It's so juicy and sticky, but not very bitter at all. Intense but not harsh. Double Double Mosaic Dream reminds me of Society & Solitude #6, which is one of my favorite DIPAs. It belongs in that company. It's that good. This is the best new to me DIPA I've had in a while."
"Insanely delicious, juicy, soft IPA. "
Really really good. Once you crack open the can you can get hit with the tropical smell right away. It's crazy how much flavor they pack into this thing using just one hop. This is one of th better beers I've had
"Hazy golden, big white head and nice lacing. Aromas of juicy hops. Notes of citrus, pineapple, grapefruit flesh, orange juice and cream of wheat. Fluffy, creamy, lush, medium body and dry. Simply stunning DIPA with big juicy hop profile."
Poured from a 16oz can into an Other Half All Green Everything tulip glass. Thanks so much Ryan for this. 
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Aroma is juicy with peach notes and dank hops. Taste is also sweet and juicy with some dank hops on top. Really good."
Look: Super hazy golden orange. One finger big soapy white bubbles. Tons of glass lacing. The beer looks great!
"Can dated 4/21/17 poured into a large snifter. Look is a hazy peach color with a fluffy white heads that fades, lacing rings the glass when consumed! The smell is blueberry, tropical fruits, light dank, and subtle cracker notes but all are subtle nothing overpowering! Taste is a different story more on the dank/spicy hop/blueberry notes. The tropical fruits are in the back and the malt is barely there! Overall this is smooth and full (not chewy), definitely a showcase of othehalf brewings talent!"
Canned one week ago. 
"Wow. I was not expecting this! This is right up there with any of the best IPAs I've had, and I've had a lot. It looks like you'd expect--hazy, orange, creamy white head and a healthy lacing. The aroma is enormous but not gratuitous. Notes of tropical fruits, citrus peel and a touch of florals. The taste follows the aromas closely.I mostly taste mango and pineapple, with a bit of pine sap in the finish. What i really love about this beer is that it's not fruit juice. It bites back the way a beer this size should. Very soft, but well carbed and nice bitterness. Also, no booziness. Overall this is pretty close to as good as it gets in my opinion. I've been waiting for an Other Half beer to really wow me, and this one definitely did!"
"One of the best Mosaic hopped beers I've had. Look is semi hazy. Darker orange in color, small off white head. Smell is all Mosaic. Smells amazing! Taste is full of Mosaic goodness. Tropical and dank. Amazing flavor. Drinks light for a DIPA. Expected it to be heavier. Overall, this is a phenomenal Mosaic DIPA."
"Warning: if you don't like Mosaic hops, DO NOT DRINK THIS BEER!!! It is all Mosaic, all day long and twice on Sunday."
"Poured from a can dated 4/21/17. The beer pours a beautiful, hazy, bright orange color with lots of white, soapy head that leaves nice lacing."
"Poured from a can. Look is beautiful golden orange. Smell is fruity, floral, with piney back end. Taste is big on the sweet grapefruit and then disappears from the palate. Nothing lingers. Dammit Other Half, you're killing me with these beers."
"This is easily my favorite Other Half beer and that's already saying something. So much Mosaic here, and I'm just in love with DDH. Love this one and how the Mosaic stands out over everything else. Again, delicious!"
"Best IPA on the market right now. Hazy but not a yeast bomb, taste is tangerine and orange, smooth finish slight bitterness. Better than anything I've had from treehouse and trillium to date. Can date is 3/3/17. ISO more if anyone gets it regularly."
It pours a copper/orange color with nice haze for an OH beer. I honestly don't get much on the nose. Some understated tropical fruits. The taste is very earthy up front. It's dank as hell but manages to remain virtually bitterness-free due to the lupulin powder. 
Growler filled a couple hours ago at Other Half. Doesn't get any fresher than this.
"Cloudy orange gold body, New England-style, with a bountiful head that left lace clinging to the glass. Aromas of bright, floral citrus fruit on the nose substantiated with the first sip. Tangy fruit zest and candy powder up-front, then a little dull funk creeps in on the finish. Mild earthy bitterness moderates the sweetness and clenches the tongue lightly. Softly carbonated and smooth with a medium-weight feel. Another classic take on the style from one of the masters. 3/3/17 canning."
week or so fresh can drank on 3/16/2017
"A: Smoky, fiery orange. White frothy, head a la slushie. Sporadic yet artful lacing."
"Pours deep dark orange nice white head with great lacing. Aroma of citrus and a light weed at the end. Taste is awesome. Pine, grapefruit, resin, light earth tone, pink lemonade with light booze finish. Excellent I look forward to more from them."
"Yup. This is the one. One of OH's finest. Everything written below regarding taste, smell.. it's all true. It's an incredible beer. Lucky for us they have been nice enough to make it often."
"this beer was insane to me. when I walked into OH on saturday there was a distinct smell in the air that I was not used to being so pungent and noticeable to me in any brewery. come to find out after grabbing cans and coming back in for some pours that I was smelling the DDH mosaic dream in people's glasses. this is one of the most room-filling IPAs i've ever come across. doesn't pour the murkiest of beers, definitely hazy with a nice strong head on it. smell was huge: oranges, clementines, pineapples, peaches, limes, bubblegum, fruit punch, crisp fruit salad, fresh newly cut grass, it was all there. the taste was just as mind blowing as the smell: everything mosaic has to offer, the above fruit salad mentioned, a fresh green hop bite, over a bready but not sweet malt. feel was almost exactly where youd want it for a beer with this complex of a flavor. the next time this is in cans, i will be there. wondering if they use mosaic lupulin powder for that batch, i've never smelled anything like it."
This is absolutely a magical brew that I wish OH would make all the time! Was lucky enough to get to try this a few different times in its limited run and it was Mosaic hops on top of Mosaic hops on top of Mosaic hops which are some of my favorite hops! Amazing hop character and not crazy powerful booze notes so I am in love for sure!
This is the best beer I have ever tasted. The taste is akin to swan diving off of an olympic high dive constructed out of papaya flavored twizzlers into a pool of pink lemonade & pineapple juice. When you rise to the surface of the pool it starts raining blueberries. It has a nose as seductive as a Tree House Green and taste noticeably better. I bought a case of this when it was released on 3/4/17 and won't be trading a single can away. I took a few cans to a smoke filled warehouse party to share and when I cracked the first one a friend standing several feet away (who isn't a beer nerd) remarked on the incredible aroma before I even had a chance to tell him this was some dank shit. Good luck finding some.
Pours like a thick cloud of juice. Smells of citrus with a little weed. Tastes like mango juice with some blueberry and grapefruit added. Feels smooth and creamy. My first beer from these guys and it certainly lived up to the hype. Great stuff.
Pours an orangish hazy cloudy yellowish appearance. Smells of pine and resin and pineapple. Taste is definitely tropical fruit with some nice hip bitterness on the back end. Nice resins mouthfeel.
Canned 12/29/16 (DOUBLE). Enjoyed 2/22/17. Acquired in a trade for Threes SFY.
"Other Half has established themselves as a force and 2nd to none in the NE IPA space. Dark golden opaque orange, dense head, massive tropical fruit nose, dank and fruity citrus flavor, and great feel. I'll be looking for more OH. Thanks Adam for the trade!"
"There are A lot of great Mosaic hop beers out there, this one is right up there with the best of them. This ranks up there in the top 5 of Other Half beers."
"L: Hazy pumpkin, apricot, and honeycomb hues with a thick white head"
"Smells like a wet dream. So lovely in the aroma. Pungent, pungent, prickly sweet fruit nectars. Passionfruit, mango and pineapple. That's really the standout for me with this beer. It smells damn good. "
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
The beer you should drink at a tropical party in an overcrowded New York City apartment.
"Picked this up when it was released at the brewery in September, as the date on the bottom of the can was 9/23 with 'Violently hoppy"" written above it. I loved the Double Mosaic Dream but this took it a step further as the juice was perfect here and the dry-hopped nature of this beer allowed the bitterness to softly grow in stature at the end of each sip."
This is one of the best IPAs I had in 2016. Had an entire can to myself. Was very thick and hazy with little to no bitterness at all. That's just how I like my IPAs. Wish I could line the fridge with this one.
"initial look is dark orange and hazy. initial smell is amazing. this is the most amazing smell beer i have ever smelled. extremely pungent. initial taste is loaded with hops and hops and more hops. i could literally taste the smell of the beer, amazing. as you would expect, citrusy with pineapple along with that slight mosaic bitterness at the finish. mouthfeel is extremely smooth."
"big thanks to robbie for never being last in line and always hooking uo a taste. where double mosaic dream failed to deliver, this one comes through and shines like a king. straight up hop juice with that other half tinge. possibly my favorite other half to date."
"Pours a hazy, near opaque yellow-orange hue, great lacing and 2 fingers white head. Smell of mango, tropical fruit, maybe some orange and grapefruit. Taste is burst of tropical fruit, maybe mango and sweet papaya and then the finish is tangerine and oranges. Great mouthfeel. Almost no bitterness"
"32oz growler from the brewery. Pours a hazy golden orange with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. The nose is tones of juicy tropical fruits. Guava, papaya, mango, tangerine, passionfruit, pineapple, melon, and some light dank and grassy hops. The taste is much like the aroma. Sweet tropical fruits but with a bit more dank hops this time around. Lime, mango, papaya, grapefruit and melon with the grassy notes towards the end. Chewy, heavy mouthfeel with some dryness. A bit sweet, but not overly so. Light alcohol presence. Overall, just an amazing beer."
"I've tried nearly 40 beers from Other Half. Most of them are terrific, some downright fantastic. However this is the only one that I have taken the time to write a review for. "
"The beer comes in a medium gold, medium plus haze."
"Incredible beer. So glad @mpontiakos and I were able to enjoy this one at a festival. Easily the best of the IPAs there, it's too bad @brians52 was too busy to join."
Boom! What a terrific example of NE style IPA. Well balanced and Hazy goodness. @thebluejerzzzz and I crushed this beer till I couldn't see straight. @brians52 I hope you get the opportunity to enjoy this beer.
Review 250!
Canned 9/23/16. Consumed 9/27/16.
Smells of cannabis and sweet hops
"L - saturated opaque orange, 1 finger head fades to a thin layer"
A - Golden pear body with a fine bubbled bone white head. Great retention and lace.
"04/2016 - This was a delightful mistake; huge fan of the combination of Galaxy, Mosaic, and Nelson to create a balanced juicy yet hoppy bite. Fruit for dayz!"
"When fresh, it smells and tastes like pot"
"Canned on 02/09/18, 10:07:39."
Thanks for the can Kevin!
"Pours out super hazed pineapple juice like color, thin bright white head recedes quickly, minimal to no lacing. Pretty punchy aromas of grapefruit, lemon, and mango, some pithy and dank green notes as well. On palate is acidic grapefruit and orange juice, pine needles, harsh and almost chalky green herbal quality, hop burn, no real malt to speak of. Mouthfeel is decent but suffers as a result of the chalky and harsh aspects of the flavor profile. Overall this was a decent beer, but not top notch. Had multiple cans and one was compared blind to TH C44 ... no contest at all."
"Just missed it for me (only slightly) due to more bitterness and not enough juiciness. For me. Still, pretty damn good."
16oz can dated 2/9/18.
"On draft at Trillium-Canton. Appearance is basically orange juice both in color and opaqueness. Tropical fruit and great aromatic aroma. Fruity. Pineapple, mango, peach and juicy. Good mouthfeel with a bit of a dry, mild bitter hop bite at the end. Exceptional."
Canned about a week ago.
Pours yellow opaque into the glass with a thin head. Light citrus and mango on the nose. Taste is similar without an overpowering hop bitterness. Definitely one worth chasing after.
Look: Yellow hazy with small white head. Has low carbonation.
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a strong citrus. Taste is also a fairly strong citrus that is very pleasant.
Giving this one the benefit of the doubt because the bottle was slightly old. But overall still the usual murky fantasticness I've come to expect from Trillium.
Favorite Trillium so far & I've had a lot of their beers.
Big thanks to @my_knew_craft for splitting this one with me!
"pours a gorgeous murky yellow. smell is big pineapple, orange, and pine, some light peach as well. taste is HUGE and pungent: clementines, pineapples, mangoes, peaches, dank weed and grass, no malt apparent. just the very slightest bit of booze but it balances it. mouthfeel is awesome, killer DIPA fuzz. perfect brew, I know they said it was a one time brew, but this may my favorite double IPA from trillium. please brew it again!! if not, Scaled Up will suffice.... i guess......"
I was finally able to track this one down… It was definitely not easy as it released a while ago. I knew it would still be amazing as Trillium remains juicy and Dank for months unlike some other New England IPAs that fade in a few weeks
"Great beer, it's a shame it was a one time offering by Trillium. But if you're lucky enough to get it definitely try it. Delicious beer. Smells great tastes wonderful, make this again Trillium!"
750 ml bottle was poured into a snifter. 
"750 ml bottle. Pours cloudy light orange, big fluffy white head, lasts, tiny bubbly lacing everywhere. Citrusy pineapple aroma jumps out, just wanna keep sniffing this one. Taste bursts with pineapple and mango juiciness, earthy herbal nets round out the taste. Just enough sweet cracker malt sweetness. Thin to medium slick mouthfeel with dry crisp ending. Wow this brew is outstanding!"
A: Another super cloudy beer from Trillium. Hazy kind of dull apricot color with a thin white head.
"From bottle. Cloudy and hazy orange. Disappointed with the head and lacing. Smell is great. Some dank citrus with a hint of malt. More bitter than their standard offering, but I like. Super juicy with strong carb."
wow- another IIPA winner from Trillum.. fantastic nose.. the Columbus hop being used in Trill just give it a difference that I love... the dankness on nose and taste are just unreal for my palate.. just a dank juice bomb... another winner..
"Another solid brew from Trillium. I get more of the tropical notes in the nose with a little bit of pine at the end. Very hazy in appearance. Taste is beautiful: Sweeter, tropical, citrusy and a dry finish. Everything you want in a double IPA."
750 mL bottle. Hazy light orange. Smells tropical and citrusy. Heavy dose of sugar behind it. A little resin and pine behind it. Taste has sweet orange followed by sweet pale malt. Resiny in the finish and a bit of booze. Medium heavy. Very nice.
"Read the commercial description for this beer and you'll know exactly what to expect. Holy shit, this beer is astoundingly good. To write a full review would be fruitless at this point - trade for this any chance you get. I'm kicking myself for only purchasing one bottle, definitely my favorite Trillium beer and one of the top IPAs I've ever drank."
Bottled 4/8/2016. 
Hazy golden orange color.
"Pours golden orange, unfiltered with a one finger head. Smells very dank, citrusy topical. Taste follows the nose... bitter and hoppy, dank and tropical. Really nice. Had this side by side with Scaled, and the flavor really does boom in this beer and the body certainly feels nicer. Awesome beer."
Really solid. Probably my fav Trillium DIPA. But still prefer their DDH pales
Pours a cloudy hazy orange yellow color with a 1 inch head.
4/8/2016 bottle drank in a chalice on 4/21/2016
Pours a cloudy hazy orange yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smells like grapefruit and oranges. Nice smooth hop flavor with a mildly bitter finish. Nice thick mouthfeel for an IPA.
Such citrusy goodness. Tropical as well. An absolutely amazing IPA. One of their best.
L: Hazy golden orange hues with a generous white foamy head
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a pint glass. Thanks Big Julius for the hookup.
"Scary experiment here. An oops I added too many hops from an overtly hop forward brewery. It is actually too much on the taste though. Nose is the best smelling beer I've ever sniffed, but it crushes the palette."
"There were so many different smells and tastes to list. Poured cloudy yellow/ gold. Light crisp taste and a dry bitter finish. Fruity, dank and onion maybe? There was an earthy taste mixed in with everything else. Best beer I've had in a while. Drinks easy and fast, one of those "" dangerous"" beers that hides the high ABV well."
Great from the start. Nice mix of dank and citrus on the nose with a creamy color and mouth feel. Reminds me of Very Hazy from Tree House but with a little less hoppy flavor.
"The smell on this beer is unbelievable...tons of tropical fruits on the nose. The taste is easily on par, if not slightly better, with Very Hazy but doesn't get the hype it deserves. Hope to god this isn't a one time brew."
"One of a kind. For an 8% beer just incredible depth of flavor. Love the way the dank hops are brought forward and really showcased, grapefruit, lemon peel, fresh hay. The apricot, nectarine, asparagus finish is just so fucking crafted."
750ml bottle dated 04/08/16
750ml bottle poured into a snifter.
"Have had 3 bottles now at 1 week intervals since release. The beer has changed alot since the day I bought it. Pours a murky orange as most Trillium IPAs do. The nose is outstanding on this...a mix of galaxy and mosaic all coming together in heavenly hop harmony. Taste is a blast of galaxy initially for me, sweet and tropical and then it fades to mosaic, dank and earthy. Mouthfeel is spot on...creamy and ""thick""...like drinking a hop milkshake. Overall, another outstanding hoppy beer by Trillium."
"Standard hazy trillium color. The nose is a beautiful citrus, lemony nose. The taste more harsh and bitter than the nose led on. The feel is slightly harsh, less sweet and smooth then most of the great trilliums. Overall a very good beer on the 2nd tier of trillium IPAs."
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"ah yes, trillium and hops...a marriage made in beer happiness. bottles 4/8, thanks to mark for the goandpickitupformebro! super hazy and smells Uber fresh and ripe. sticky icky. taste is a hop assault. more bitter than fruit forward but the fruit is there. not my favorite from trillium but a killer nonetheless."
Bomber poured into a glass
Bottle Date: 4/8/16
"A: Decent head, but little staying power, very little lacing. Super hazy; this looks just like I've come to expect a top shelf Trillium IPA to look. "
This beer is amazing. Please mr trillium! This CAN NOT be a one time deal. Nuff said. Customers first!!!!!
"Pineapple, little bit of lemon rind, pine resin, grapefruit pith and biscuit malt. Clean and bright up front tapering off to a balanced sweet bitterness. Semi dry. Traditional creamy Trillium mouthfeel."
I would rate this one of Trillium's top beers. Tasty Juice bomb DIPA that is surprisingly smooth. I heard that they are making this a one off. Hope that its not true. Outstanding.
This beer is absolute perfection. Pours golden with a huge fruit taste right away. Zero booze taste.
"Pours like a golden cantaloupe. There is like that faux transparency on the fringes. Smells like oranges and white wine. It smells truly incredible. Some mango up front followed by nice orange pithy citrus. It's super soft. Like biting into a freshly picked Florida orange. There is a little resin on the finish, but it's texture more than bitterness. It is a little boozy. This might be my new favorite IPA from Trillium."
"L - Ugly, Murky light orange/dark yellow with two fingers of white head that disappeared quickly."
"Pours like orange juice, super hazy with a minimal white head. Aroma is super juicy, tons of orange, pineapple, and mango. Taste is super juicy as well and mirrors the aroma with the addition of some melon towards the finish. Very good mouthfeel, I'd say a bit better than usual from Trillium, medium-ish body. Overall a great beer; this combines the Trillium juiciness that I love so much but adds an extra note that I typically perceive in Tree House's NE IPAs to create a near perfect beer. Bottom line: this is a must try and is my favorite beer from Trillium (and I freakin' lived the last 2 batches of PM Dawn). I know this is supposedly a one-off but I really hope they decide to make this beer again."
"Had high hopes for this, expectations were blown away."
"Honestly, complete sincerity, i hate how good this beer is. We drank DDH Fort point, which is beyond stellar, then we drank this, SWU is dramatically better. Deep hop aroma, nothing piny, just pure juice. Followed by the most ultra smooth IPA. I mean this is 8 percent and taste like it could be 4. Damn you trillium"
"This DIPA pours out white grape juice mixed with pineapple juice and looks the same with some mango juice in the glass. Smells like mangoes and papayas along with some pine. It's pretty great but the taste gets even better. Starts with strong tropical flavors, mangoes papaya, then goes into some pine and rind bitterness to balance, and it lingers with tropical fruit for quite a long time which is what you want because you want to savor the flavors of this beer for even longer. Still the day after drinking i get flashbacks of this, its that good. Incredible mouthfeel, soft and full further enhancing this beer. There is no alcohol in this, super drinkable. Overall this is an incredible brew and my new favorite from them. Hope they brew it again soon."
"Finally able to stop by and check out Trillium and glad I did. Just cracked this bottle dated 4/8/16 and poured into a Wormtown IPA glass. Hazy, golden-yellow/pineapple color. Smell of tropical fruit, light biscuit, bit of pine and the smell definitely matches. The feel is soft and pillow-like. The finish is what I think is a standout of this beer. It lingers with a really nice hoppy bite; not an overly harsh bite but sticks around along nicely with the tropical fruit notes. I found this to go down way too quick despite then nice lingering ""aftertaste"" I just wanted to keep it going and crushed it. Fantastic beer, I plan on adding Trillium more to my rotation even though Tree House is my closest local option--can't go wrong with either one they are tops in their class!"
"A hop explosion, but all delicious and juicy. By no means too intense. Bottled 4/8/16. That moment when you savor the taste after swallowing seems to be in slow motion. It lingers in a very good way."
Bottled on 4/8/16; drank the next day on 4/9/16 in a teku glass; this beer is 8% ABV as it is not listed above currently; hats off to fresh beer and particularly a fresh New England IPA from a world-class brewery!
Pours a hazy yellow Be
"Color is hazy Sunshine. Aromas of cut florals with dank Cantaloupe. Taste like all great DIPAs starts fruity, long finish not boozy. This is my favorite DIPA from Trillium."
Trillium continues to introduce great hop forward beers and they are finding the limits of reasonableness. There is a sharp pine to this that intrudes on pleasant. It drinks like an extreme experiment whereas Scaled is a soft joy. Fantastic offering but way big which may be the point.
"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a snifter. This was bottled today, April 8th, 2016."
"Light, non-bitter, refreshing."
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
"Trillium in a Tree House can. Sharp and fresh. Would try again, but I prefer Sap. Basically what you’d find at the brewery 90 min up the road. Can’t complain, an outstanding beer."
"Canned 11/06/18 ""TIM BUCKANOWSKI"""
"Appearance: Hazy and opaque golden amber color. A big, frothy, white head that settles down but still leaves a finger as I drink. Some lacing along the edge the glass. "
Appearance - Pours opaque like orange juice with big dense white head and big steaks of lacing all around the glass.
"06/2015 - What a surprise and boy does it not disappoint; all the juiciness of Julius yet a really nice bite in the back end; fairly crisp, lightly bitter, yet very refreshing and clean."
"A very good NEIPA. I get a strong amount of citrus, like clementines, with some pineapple in the background. there is a good balance between piney hops and sweer malt. Overall a very good brew."
"Alter Ego pours thicker than expect burnt orange color with a great cloudy, with a 1-finger head that loves to linger with some excellent lacing retention. The smell is sweet malt with juicy pineapple and grapefruit up front with a bit of stone fruit and mango. Taste hits with a big bitterness up front followed by the juicy fruits with the pineapple and grapefruit. There's a candied sweetness midway through the swallow that helps to balance the flavor."
Excellent
Very solid IPA related to Julius. 
"Beautiful opaque honey orange color, bold and fresh aroma. Notes of citrus and tropical fruit. Intensely bitter, rich hops. Juicy splendor!"
"a: super hazy bunt orange color with a nice caramel and amber note in there as well. large, 3 finger frothy off-white head. the color on this is incredible for a NEIPA"
"Pours cloudy, bright gold with a 2 finger soapy off-white head that leaves nice lacing."
Canned 6/13/18
Fantastic beer 
Poured from a 16 ounce can into a wine glass.
"Excellent IPA. A tad better than Green. Citrusy and hoppy with an easy feel and great taste. Easy to drink the whole pint. And the Cans, very good looking. God Job."
"Pours Julius like.... ;) a turbid straw yellow with hints of orange. Nice frothy white head on heavy pour. Nose is fragrant. Tropical fruit basket! Pineapple, mango and guava. This really is a souped up version of Julius. Very juicy with loads of sweet pineapple, ripe mango, guava, melon and kiwi. Nice pithy citrus in there as well and enough earthy malt and super light pine notes to keep you thinking. Really is a nice juicy IPA tho! Medium body and somewhat creamy. Could use a little more silkiness but now I’m just nitpicking and finding something for the sake of finding something. Light to no bitterness with a smooth juicy finish."
Canned 8/1/18
16oz. can: This one pours an opaque golden color. There is a wisp of a white head that leaves some lacing. A big fruity nose. Orange and faint pine. The taste is very good. Somewhat juicy and a touch bitter.. Orange and pine dominate. Another keeper!
"Very nice sweet & juicy NEIPA. Outstanding in fact. Looks just like Julius, aroma & taste are similar with a little less orange perhaps but it's still there. A little less bitterness on the tongue as well. Enjoy whenever possible, this is World Class."
This one is right up there with Julius. Overall balanced.
Cloudy amber/gold color. Minor head. 
16 oz can from the brewery. I don't see it. Smells nicely hopped. Surprised by the big sweet malt. Tastes very good with slightly bitter finish. Very fresh. Next time I'll pour it in a glass.
A: Poured from the can into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is murky golden (which is more orangey when backlit) with a half-finger of white foam on top.
"Picked-up eight cans at the Tree House Brewery for three dollars and eighty cents per can last Wednesday. I have had several brews from these guys, all very good. I liked that the ABV was not too high on this, as I made it my Father's Day beach beer. Would definitely buy again."
"Pours an unappealing, opaque, murky yellow with a minor head. Aroma of mango, citrus, not particularly inviting. Initially, the taste is very mango-like but morphs into a bitterness and flavor that I just don't like - unfortunately, I can't think of words to describe it but it's fairly unpleasant to me. I think Tree House could put shit in a can and it would get a high rating just because it's TH. Luckily, this was given to me and I didn't waste my money on it. I can't recommend this beer."
"Can date 6/13/18. Poured into a tulip. Gold/straw yellow around the edges, darker in the center. Smell: some pine, more citrus. Some onion or dank. Taste: follows the nose, but I also got a weird and very enjoyable trace of licorice, but maybe I’m crazy. Mouthfeel: where this beer shined. Some beers are better on the nose, but this one shined once you tasted it. Better than I remember. Nice job."
"Waited in line for one hour at Tree House. Poured into the attractive Tree House glass. Beautiful color and foamy head. Smell is complex with piney features. Full bodied flavor, rich multi dimentuial flavors. Somewhat unusual but top tier."
"A: The body is bright orange with a great white head that shows an amazing retention. Aspect-wise, this beer is actually really good."
"Fairly old can dated 3/29/2018, poured into pint glass. It pours a hazy, pale yellow color with an enormous, fluffy egg shell colored head and lots of fluffy lacing. The smell is decadent with tangerine, lemon, honeydew melon, and sweet malt. It tastes super fruity up front with both ripe melon and tart lemon and grapefruit. The Mosaic and Amarillo hops are flavorful but not overly bitter. It's simply delicious! This ale is silky and creamy, with moderate carbonation, and its 6.8% ABV allows for easy drinking. You'll want a second pour. Overall, this is a fabulous IPA that lives up to its World-Class rating. I'm glad to finally have had the opportunity to drink it."
"In my opinion, Julius is a far superior beer to this one. This is still a good beer but why would anyone choose it over the original?"
"A: The beer is very hazy (and a bit pale) yellow in color. It poured with a finger high white head that quickly died down, but consistently left a thin head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass."
Sibling of Julius as advertised.
Looking at the ratings I would have to say that having a can that was nearly two months old certainly did take away from what others see as a superior beer. 
"Can: Poured a cloudy and hazy bright yellow color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of floral undertones of citrusy notes with some tropical notes with some residual sugar notes is quite enticing. Taste is a great mix of floral undertones of hoppy citrusy notes with some tropical notes, dank and quiet a bit of residual sugar notes. Body is full with good carbonation. Incredible well brewed NEIPA thought maybe a tad to sweet for my taste."
My first Tree house brew so it will always be special to me.
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned om 3/7/2018. Pours opaquely hazy golden orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/sticky, fairly crisp, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 6.8%. Overall this is an amazing NEIPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink; with the mellowly bitter/drying finish, never aggressive. Amazing soft spot on mouthfeel for the style. Extremely juicy, vibrant, and dank/earthy balanced hop complexity; great bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness. Just a bit more bitter/drying than I expected; but no complaints really. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing style example."
"Looks a little like someone vomited raw eggs in a glass, smells and tastes better than that. Has a nice foamy head, doubt someone vomited in the brewing vessel prior to canning. Overall a solid beer, i prefer the newburyport riverwalk turbine, a better , cheaper alternative. Overall similar flavor profile, I would argue turbine is a better beer, less hype."
A little hoppy for my wife but I enjoyed it. Went down easy.
"Very grassy, with a creamy mouthfeel"
"Poured out a hazy orange/golden color. Nose was very subtle with hints of tropical fruit. Don't expect a big hop explosion on the nose, which was a surprise, in a good way. Taste was citrusy with notes of tropical fruit, blended with a bready malt. Lingering flavors has the grassy hops finishing it out. One of the better taste profiles i've had in an IPA. Mouthfeel was creamy and very satisfying. Didn't feel thin at all. Sip this one as it can go down quite easily. A truly fantastic beer."
"pours a crazy hazy turbid golden orange with a creamy head, another beautiful beer"
Canned 3 weeks ago and tried alongside a two-week-old can of Doppelganger
"Pours a very cloudy golden orange color with a finger width foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is very juicy, very citrusy and moderately earthy bitterness. On point. Big juicy taste. Citrusy and somewhat peppery with a good amount of bitterness. A little more grassy than piney. There is a mildly bitter aftertaste. Very good beer."
Bottom of the pint can reads: MRS. FEATHERBOTTOM 1/25/18. Opened on 1/29/18
"Alter Ego is kind of like Adriana Lima in a 1 piece. It’s kind of like, ‘Hey, we’re working with some quality stuff here. Why not hop into a 2 piece?’ And that is Alter Ego for Raul: hella appealing, hella sexy, but it has a lil tumble on that last hurdle."
"Fantastic nose, great dank taste and last sip is a true hop treasure."
"So, in a form, unenlightened life, Treehouse's Haze was probably my favorite IPA. Living in Minnesota, this means I only get to drink Treehouse every few months. Still - I vividly remember drinking Julius, Green, and then Haze... and being ready to stop, because why continue when you've found perfection?"
"Tall can, 11/28/17"
"Canned 12/21. Looks like carbonated orange juice, substantial lacing and nice ring of foam. Citrus and peach smell. A little more floral than citrus fruit flavor. Very soft, mouthfeel and smooth finish. This is one of my favorites."
"The reputation is well deserved, this is fantastic beer. So much fun to watch it pour into the glass, the very turbid yellow-gold color, wonderful nose. The beer is gone before you know it, too soon!"
Pouring a cold can info a snifter. The beer pours a hazy golden orange color with a creamy eggshell white head of 2 cm. The foam fades slowly to a sturdy edge layer and thin surface cover. Leaves tight lattice as it slides down the glass.
This is by so far my favorite Tree House offering. I'm so glad I got a bunch!
These guyz. They get it.
Look: Pours an opaque orange with a full finger pure white head. Looks like a glass of carbonated orange juice. A swirl reveals beautiful lacing and slight legs. 
Solid brew from an extremely solid brewery.
Best of the commonly available Treehouse beers IMO
"Poured into my 13 oz Tired Hands Teku glass, unfortunately canned on 9/4/17. Pours a very hazy dark orange with a 2 plus sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace all over the glass."
Haven't had Julius to know the base beer but this one is amazing. Tons of juicy flavor but a perfect amount of bitterness to keep it balanced. I am so happy that I was able to get my hands on this beer. Will seek out many more from Tree House.
another great offering from TH. Worth the long wait in line.
"Similar to julius, little more crisp and easier to drink many ... great taste cold and slightly less appealing as it gets warmer.... overall great beer ... especially if kept ice cold"
It was better when they made it in Munson. Not sure what happpened.
"Apparently conceived as the ""Alter Ego"" to Julius, featuring Mosaic and Amarillo hops... Canned 10/1717, this is a juicy New England-style brew loaded with citrus and tropical fruit impressions - you can taste the fleshy mango, bright orange, and their sugars, tightened with bitter grapefruit pith and the green skins of unripe fruits... Soft and smooth, moderately carbonated, moderately bitter, and mildly sweet... 6.8% abv... A great overall drinking experience..."
"From a 2-day-old can, pours a dark, hazy orange. Small head and minimal lacing. Smell hits me as I'm pouring, with tons of fresh oranges, peaches, berries, pineapple and other tropical and citrus fruits. Taste follows. Smooth, soft feel. Delicious, amazing."
"some puply oj, pithy grapefruit, soft peach, some herbaceous green qualities and a touch of bready malts and gummy sweetness. well rounded, soft mouthfeel ... overall very solid."
"L - Opaque ""dirty water"" orange"
"From the can...hazy golden color with thick white head. Grapefruit, pine, and mango smells with sweet malty earthiness. Juicy and fruity, but balanced flavor. Medium body and carbonation with just the right amount of bitterness. Very drinkable; Excellent!"
"Aroma- Upon opening, early hints of Papaya, Mango, Pineapple. As carbonation settles the Mosaic/Amarillo hops prevail with earthiness and spiciness."
"Canned 09/06/17, it pours cloudy orange gold color which resembles guava juice with a solid 1 finger white foamy head that was full of small bubbles, dissipating slow to average time leaving pretty great looking foamy lacing coating the sides with thick foamy rings as it went down. A great looking IPA from a can."
Dark cloudy yellow-straw appearance with significant whit head that desipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with some citrus accent. Taste is a very pleasant hoppy citrus without any bitterness or other unpleasant aftertaste. Very nice IPA.
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass 2 days after the release. Appearance is opaque and bright orange in color with two finger thick white head (fairly good retention). Smell is noticeably Mosaic up front with onion and blueberry notes, but there is a lot of earthy hop flavor that I am assuming comes from the Amarillo hops. There are also notes of citrus (grapefruit/orange) and resin and caramel sweetness (maybe a hint if pine). "
"First Tree House beer for me. The smell immediately starts things off beautifully. Super juicy, orange and pineapple and mango. The taste is just as good, at least. Tones of tropical and citrus fruit, a slight malt backbone and a dry finish. Beautiful. Lives up to the hype."
Hazy Orangy-Yellow appearance with a nice foamy head
One of my favorites .
Can received in trade with Kevin.
"Everything about this beer is excellent. Great, clean taste, nice amount of bitters. Excellent IPA"
"Tasted from can. Pours a super murky dark orange with white head. Aroma is pineapple, melon, mango, grapefruit, lemon. Big time fruity aroma. Taste is supremely well balanced. Flavors similar to nose with lots of citrus and tropical fruits along with some herbal elements and a little pine. Incredible IPA."
"Take note, thid is how you use mosaic! This beer is a mosaic showcase. What an absolutely stunning beer!"
"Pours merky yellow with a nice two finger white head. Great lacing. Aroma of citra, pineapple juice and orange juice. Taste follows the nose with candied fruit and watermelon. Excellent as always from treehouse. Big fan of them."
"Look: Yellow, hazy, with three inch head."
Smell is incredible citrus goodness. One of the best IPA beers I've ever stuck my nose in.
16 oz. can dated 06/16/17
This was a draft pour from their new Charlton location.
Got this the other day. Latest release.. Had it once before and was a solid drinkable just really nice IPA. It would be an understatement to say that this most recent batch is awful and borderline undrinkable. The yeast flavor is overwhelming. The only way I can properly describe the taste is by equating it to waffle or pancake batter. Absolutely awful. I made this account just so I can post this review and voice my disappointment with what is becoming more hype than consistency.
L: dark golden color with a finger of off white head. 
A: Poured into a nonic pint to a light golden orange topped by a dense two finger white head that retains well and leaves decent lacing
Got this in a trade along with Haze. Hoping it lives up to the hype!
Let be this beer! Along with Haze and Doppelgänger it is in my top 3 of TreeHouse regulars. 
"Nose is nowhere near Julius, which is surprising because it is supposedly dry hopped with more varieties than Julius. Still an excellent beer, but the nose was underwhelming."
"Hands down worth all the hype, preferred to Julius as I believe the hop addition brings increased complexity. One of the best IPA's I have ever tried."
"Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can, one of 120 that he sent my way recently. Cool, Escheresque blue artwork dated 5/5/17. Dig. "
A: deep orange haze. So deep almost amber. Thick creamy white bubbles. Zero clarity. 
It's Damn Good.
A - real hazy golden amber color with a white head that sticks for a while. 
Can dated 4/6/17. Poured into a nonic pint glass.
"Pours a murky orange, little head."
Dry hopped Julius. Awesome.
"Can poured into glass. TH standard- hazy orange color; modest carbonation. While this is a decent beer this is not on the level of a Julius, or Juice Machine. The fruits are there as well as the hops; nice finish on palate"
Tree House can do no wrong... very citrusy despite it not being as fresh as I should've had it. The Mosaic comes through perfectly and Amarillo pairs very good with it.
"Poured from cans into Tree House tulip. Extremely hazy like Green, but darker color. Blood orange taste. On draft, similar funk to Julius."
I get what they were trying to do but the end was a bit fizzy and lacked the coating and depth of a Julius. Won't be going outta my way to have it again but it's a damn good beer.
Had high expectations for this and it pretty much lived up to them. Always nice to get anything treehouse. This was simply superb.beautiful fruit notes dominated and you can clearly see where the new NYC breweries get their juice bomb inspiration from.excellent
I prefer the Julius over this but it does have it'd similarities. You can definitely taste the Amarillo and mosiac combo. Drinking out or a one week old growler so I could be missing out on some flavors that's from different from the cans. It's still an easy drinking one that's more session than a 8%. Then again TH is great at hiding the alcohol.
"A: the New England standard here, hazy and orange juicy looking "
A great balance of juicy sweetness and floral hop bitterness.
750ml poured into Tulip 
great great beer.
16oz can poured into a tulip
"Pours A golden hazy orange. Thick, medium, white head that lasts a while. "
Fresh 16 oz can brewed 1-17-17 into a snifter glass.
Perfection
My first Tree House beer and it lived up to the hype!
"Orange almost, fluffy head. Smell is peachy, hint of booziness, candy lemon. Bitter rind, super fruity and citrus... pineapple, mango, definite mosaic hops, sweet orange. Malt is nice but not overwhelming, sweet biscuit taste and bubblegum on the back. Fizzy and pillowy and smooth. Feels like a wet finish but somehow ends dry."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a Aslin stem-less Teku Canned 
Poured into a tulip:
Canned 10-29-15. Drank 11-21-15.
Another wonderful Tree House creation. Similar to Julius but with a more harsh finish
A: cloudy; medium gold in color; 1+ finger ivory head that receded to a thin cap; very nice lacing;
"Yet another phenomenal beer from TH. Looks as dense and hazy as the rest of their offerings. I may be crazy, but I believe their beers all smell quite similar - Ripe oranges first, followed by melon/mango. This beer is more balanced than some of their other beers with the sweetness and bitterness; however, I prefer their sweeter offerings. This one leaves the mouth a bit drier, but it's got a solid medium body with good carbonation. I'd gladly drink this one again."
"tasty beer. nice mango and citrus from the mosaic. the body was garbage though. felt like a 4%abv session, minus the bubbles. doesn't stack up to the body of their other or tritium or different haze bombs."
"16 oz can, dated 11/30/16, poured into a teku"
Treehouse is king of the IPAs.
"First had 12/5/15 at home. I really enjoyed this brew, but not as much as the base beer, Julius. It was just a touch too bitter, making it slightly less drinkable for me."
"16oz can, freshly filled, poured into a Tree House Teku Glass. Enjoyed on 10.14.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
My top 3 fav ipa.... And I've had a lot
"As my journey into the Tree House and craft beer world continues I find myself at times perplexed...Sometimes the beers just taste different . Did I eat too soon before sampling? was my growler not cleaned thoroughly enough? Did my can experience too much of a temperature fluctuation? Did it need to age a week more? I don't know yet...I am no expert, but Alter Ego is a good example of what I mean. I first sampled AE in a growler, then from a can then from a growler again. i was very satisfied with my first two experiences...but along came THE growler from the last time ... i was only going to reward myself with just a 5 oz sample but like THE batch of Double Shot 500, Cosmic Forces aligned...the whole bottle was gone before I knew it and it was perfect...I pictured myself in some kind of Roman beer cistern wearing robes and happy to be alive. I appreciate the others makers and I am not a slave to convention or sheep-think but I am hooked on what TH stands for and the results they get. Pine, mango, citrus, straw dank or skank it does not matter. It was utterly delicious."
Tree House Alter Ego
Sampled the same day it was canned. Open can greets you with hops aroma. Pours cloudy. Mouth feel is soft and juicy; taste is perfect balance of malt body and citrusy hops.
my first tasting of tree house and well worth the trip to get it.
"Really? Really?? How do they do it? How is every damn beer this damn good. Not as juicy as Julius...has a little more ""bite"" to it. Just an incredible brew and well deserving of its 100 rating. I drive 5+ hrs round trip to come home with 8-12 beers depending on the day and it's so worth it."
"Not much to look at. Like the other TH cans I've had the nose is an intense bouquet of citrus that dominates everything else. I actually found the taste to be a bit subdued compared to other NE-style pale ales. A tad more hop presence than others as well, making it slightly better balanced overall. If you want a direct comparison, I'd say the nose is more subdued than Juilus but the taste is slightly more complex, with a similar mouthfeel and finish."
"Beautiful golden peach haze. Some orange peel, citrus, and slight mango in the aroma but overall very subdued. These notes are much stronger in the flavor which is very nice. Would like a little more bitterness. Nice soft pillowy mouthfeel. Great beer."
From a can dated 10/19/16.
"Alter Ego pours almost identical to its twin - Julius. It's an opaque orange, with a finger of white head. Head retention is modest, but not very strong. Lacing is tight, but thin. Perhaps my eyes are digging for any differences between this and Julius, but Alter Ego appears to be a shade more of a burnt orange. The aroma is much more subtle than Julius, which is to say it is almost subdued. Its riddled with notes of orange, and citrus with biscuit malts all muddled together. While nice, it doesn't scream hops, or juicy. A sip provides a very minimally dynamic flavor profile. It's citrus and orange hops and biscuit malts, with a twist of resin hop stick at the back of the throat right at the end. Alter Ego is a much more modest relative to Julius. The resin sticks in the back of the palette for a while, lingering long between sips. A hiccup gives a blast of orange and resin hops. Mouth feel certainly has some level of particulate abrasion to it. Otherwise, mouth feel is a bit strange. It's somewhere between medium and medium-thick, almost like it can't make up its mind between being a filling, one-and-done IPA, and an easy-sipping IPA made for drinking all day on the lake. Either way, it is easy to drink. It just isn't something to sip on out in the sun and heat. Overall, it's a great beer, although perhaps a bit overshadowed by its ""twin"" Julius. Its a great IPA with much more subtle qualities then its twin, which may be more approachable for some. "
one of the best beers I've ever had
Really good!
"Hazyyyy, apricot and mango with piney resin, juicy as hell. If this were a girl you met in the bar, she'd be strawberry blonde, thick and curvey, and wouldn't take your shit bit would still play the game. You might even be able to go home with her and then, in your later years, you'd remember that moment fondly, perhaps above all others."
"Very hazy, one finger off-White head."
Pours golden orange and super hazy. 1 finger head is dense and creamy with good-ish retention. Moderate lacing but short lived.
"Hands down best beer I have had. 100% opaque in glass, two finger head, bright orange / yellow color that you would swear is emitting light. Treehouse has many fantastic beers, this is no exception."
"Really good IPA, but Treehouse has other beers that are truly amazing. It's better than anything else you can get in a packie, but not worth the long ride to Treehouse if that's all they're offering that given day."
"From a 16oz can, dated 09/06/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic."
A - Pours a dark cloudy orange with a white foamy head that settles pretty quickly.
"First off, it's taken me a long time to muster up the courage to trade for these cans. The hype is real. "
Pours cloudy dark yellow orangey light amberish color. Smells of fruit and juice. Only really get notes of passion coming through individually. Taste follows the smell with a light sweetness on the front end balanced out by a tender bitterness on the back end. Feels rather luscious in your mouth with medium light carbonation. Overall an excellent ne IPA. Treehouse does it again!
"Canned on 6.14.16 and served in my TH tulip. Pours a cloudy burnt orange with a dense, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head embedded with pinpricks and craters. Great nose - citrus, pith, a trace of spice and an earthy/piney character. Taste consistent with nose; however, more pith and less citrus forward with a suggestion of a light toasted malt bill. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with an even carbonation and an almost creamy texture with just a slight prickle. Overall, really crushable and balanced; not my favorite from TH (they set the bar high), but this is extremely drinkable."
"Hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma is really dank and juicy with tropical fruits and chives. Taste starts juicy up-front, full of stone fruits, citrus fruits. Some light bitterness on the finish with lingering grapefruit flavor. Light to medium body with crisp carbonation. One of the best IPAs I ever had."
"Picked up some from the first run of the new, official can (Sexxxy as FFFFFFFFF). This beer looks amazing (orange haze) and the mouth feel is of course perfect, like most Tree House beers. The smell is definitely more dank than its counterpart, Julius, with some general tropical fruit in there too. The taste has some dank fruit with appropriate piney bitterness at the end. I've had this beer many times now and it still seems a bit muddy with flavor to me. While a very tasty beer, I like most of Tree House's other offerings more because their flavors appear more focused. This is a very, very nice IPA when compared to the rest of the world's beers, but if I'm to judge it against Tree House's selection, it is near the bottom."
"Deep hazy orange with a big head and nice chunky lacing. Big citrusy hop aroma. Notes of grapefruit pulp, underripe pineapple, orange, light dank and toasted white bread. Crisp medium body, clean, crushable with a light linger. Amazing IPA, world class for sure."
"A spin on Julius, incredible flavor, feel and finish. My favorite."
"Can dated 7/27/16 and very amusingly labelled ""Chicka Chicka Slim Shady"" around the date on the bottom. Poured into 18 oz. Belgian ale glass."
"Thanks to my dude A.B. for bringing this second Treehouse treat back from Mass! Looks again like a milkshake, like the other TH IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking. I like the look. Super cloudy, kind of cream colored. Smell: Just a vibrant blend of citrus fruit, piney, biting hops, a slight tropical mix, some melon, papaya. Taste: Fucking A, this one was amazing. It took Julius and added layers of depth and complexity. I was truly taken with this one. Deep, complex hop flavors permeate your tongue, while the perfectly balanced malt counterbalances the hops and creates the perfect combination. This one was straight up Heady-level perfection. I wish I had a fridge full of this, I could drink this every single day. Just stunning. I could have never imagined so much flavor in a beer like this. Feel: spot on, medium-rich, effervescent, creamy. Overall: A stunner. Go git you some."
TREE HOUSE ALTER EGO 7/31/16
"Hands down, one of my 4 favorites from this brewery. It looks like it should, smells like it should (fruity, piney), tastes like a symphony, nice and thick, the flavors linger and become more complex after you swallow... a fantastic beer."
"June 14 canning, poured into tulip glass. Looks like orange juice and has a mild juice smell. The taste is similar to Julius, but less sweet. Can taste the Mosaic, but it is subtle. Excellent beer, wish I had more."
"Poured from a growler into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, deep, orange gold coloring with a foamy, clingy, off-white head. Aromas of grapefruit sweet and tart, very juicy, with pine resin and pitch bitterness. Amazing nose. Flavors are juice sweet and tart forward, on a grassy and bread backbone, with dried grass and dank piney notes. Smooth and big, with a juicy grapefruit and sticky pine resin aftertaste. Smooth, dry, bitter lingering finish. Amazing beer."
Day old 750mL growler.
UPDATED: Canned 7/15/16. Consumed 7/22/16.
Can pick up citrus in the nose. I was literally able to pick up mosaic hops in the nose alone! Very balanced IPA. Not too bitter the citrus comes in the forefront and a honey sweetness in the back end. Definitely worth seeking out
"Amazing beer. This seems like Julius but with a drier, and more bitter aftertaste. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with one inch creamy head. Taste is mango, orange, tangerine, and light piney aftertaste. Medium bodied and more bitter than Julius. I prefer Julius more, but this is soooooo good. Tree House, why did it take me so long to discover you. Great beer but my least favorite of Tree House's core four ipas."
"Alter ego. Since treehouse is so hyped and close to where I live, I try to check out their brews. So far Julius and green have been overhyped letdowns and doppelgänger and alter ego have been the ones I've enjoyed. Alter ago sniffs like a generic IPA. When I taste it, I cant pick out any fruits or flavors.... but its SOOOOOOOOOOO smooth!!!!! Creamy smooth mouthfeel saves this ordinary IPA and transforms it into something really enjoyable. Cool brew- I'd get it again."
Yes
Look : very hazy goldenish bright orange with fomay white head. - 5/5
"Here comes yet another Tree House IPA kids, The pour is hazy and golden in color with a good amount of foam collecting on top. The smell punches you IN THE FACE with hops. The taste is much like the nose, Overall this beer is outstanding, nothing shocking here really it's just what Tree House does on the Reg."
Golden orange color. White head with lace. 
"My favorite IPA from Tree House to date. This is a balanced masterpiece. The bright yet color gives way to a wonderful citrus explosion on the nose. My favorite and actually surprised impression is the taste. There is an extra added element of sweet that adds another dimension to this beer. Not a ton mind you, but it really keeps the bitterness at bay, bringing the taste really close to an orange/pineapple juice."
"Had this at the Worthy Brewfest in Springfield. Information taken from notes I took. The beer had a murky orange appearance with a very thick, attractive orangepeel and hop aroma coming from the beer. In terms of taste, the beer had a great mixture of citrus and grapefruit flavors that allowed for a mostly sweet, but a slight sour taste to the beer. The mouthfeel adds a dimension of great carbonation and crispness to this beer. Overall, I found this beer to be quite good across all rating dimensions, especially in smell and taste."
"This beer is a stunner. Canned on 6/14 and poured on 6/16. When I think of awesome NE IPAs, this is what I envision. An absolute beauty in the glass and the nose is amazing. I can't wait until they become more available so my 2 hour ride each way can gain me more than 5 cans! And believe me that that's not a knock in any way. I wish I could get a case to share with my fellow hop heads is all."
Stupidly good example of the hops... outstanding overall
Yet another stellar offering from the mighty TreeHouse
"At this point, its hardly worth reviewing their beers. I find them overall one dimensional and very similar, however alter ego stuns again with its bouquet of floral notes; an incredible body and great flavor carry it to the finish line. Maybe if anything a tad sweet"
"This one is overrated! good mouth feel, good look but after that...meh. It has a floral thing to it and aftertaste, I just don't like. How is is a 100 is beyond me."
L: Darker orange haze and glass lacing.
Really great IPA as one would expect from Tree House. The aromas just exploded out of the can and the glass. Excellent light mouth feel with a very clean finish. Enjoyed every drop
"Great beer, drank it a few times along with Julius at the same time. Noticeable difference but tasted damn good. I still prefer Julius over this but never mind getting this."
Very much my style of IPA. Well balanced blend of pine and citrus. Loved it.
So dank and citrusy. Pillowy soft mouth feel. Hazy goodness.
This one deserves a proper review. 
"Similar to Julius, but less bitter - which is a plus. Very citrusy - orange juice flavor lingers long after the swallow."
"As per usual, waited in a line of 300 or more on can-only day to get this (along with Green) for me and my Dad, visiting from far away. He was pretty dazzled and rightly so. Tree House is the best brewery in Massachusetts, by a fairly large margin, I'd say."
A hazy golden orange as you would expect from Treehouse. A citrusy mango nose and a mouth filling heavy dose of the same flavors with a pleasant balanced bitterness from the start through the long visit. Not a viscous as Julius (my favorite) but darn close. A magnificent beer!
"Such a fantastic beer! Poured from can into Tree House tulip and looks like a fruit cocktail in a glass. The tropical fruit smells and taste are amazing, but there is a little bit of bitterness on the backend to balance out the sweetness. And the mouth feel is exactly what you expect from a TH beer. I don't want this glass to end, but it's just so hard to slow down and savor this beer!"
"Days only canned on, Pours a murky cloudy sunset yellow color , citrus notes with some tangerine , and mandarin, Taste again and again is superb , super juicy tropical hops of mango papaya and citrus mix well together with just minimal caramel malts, mouth fell is smooth with a high hop assault and little bitterness, highlt drinkable and oh so tasty."
bug hanks for the impromptu share. canned 5/11 (yesterday) says life is short drink now!
"A beer using two of my favorite hops, Mosaic and Amarillo. Yes! Canned on 4/5/16. Pours very hazy dirty orange with a massive dirty white 3 finger head. Aroma is loads of juicy citrus, grapefruit, lime, and tangerine. Flavor is bursting with juicy citrus notes of sweet tangerine, clementine, and tart grapefruit, lime. The hops don't leave much for the malt, but it is there in the background. Feel is very nice, smooth and oily, excellent carbonation. This is the real deal for juicy IPAs."
"Tree House loves to toots the flavors and aromas of their beers, which sometimes i find annoying, but it this case it is spot on. Alter Ego is the dank cousin of Julius and as I have had several of both, i think I prefer the devil."
"This beer in my opinion is way overrated. Take Julius, which is a very good yet one-dimensional IPA (in other words, it lacks complexity). Dry hop it with 2-3 varieties of hops and you've made a murky tasting Julius, not a complex Julius. There is no defined hops flavor, just a bitter mediocre flavor that isn't that enjoyable to drink. Still, all in all, an above average IPA, just nothing to get hyped up about."
16oz can. Served in a stemmed glass.
"Alter Ego has got to be one of the juiciest, fruitiest IPAs I have ever tasted. Emblematic of Treehouse's other hazy, juicy, fruity IPAs, Alter Ego pushes farther, with big hop aromatics and a sweet, fluffy fruit cereal punch. Really I don't think I can overstate how juicy this one is. Huge flavor."
A - pours a hazy orange with glowing golden high lights and a bubbly off white head with good retention. 
"Consumed within two weeks of canning. Pours turbid orange with about a finger of white head. Nose is full of tart fruit.....melon, mango, pineapple, with a hint of citrus. Taste has the same fruit notes.....moderate bitterness.....not as juicy as the nose. Pick up an earthy taste on the back end. Feel is full for the style with moderate to low carbonation. Amazing.....but the earthy aftertaste puts it a slight notch below Julius."
"Pours a hazy muddled orange that is reminiscent of a dark pineapple or orange juice. The nose is mouth wateringly floral, fruity and juicy. The body has a juicy, fruity blend with a little bit of bready sweetness. The mouthfeel is just soft as per the Tree House MO and drinks extremely easily especially on a warm day."
Canned 4/19/2016. 
"This beer pours an opaque cloudy golden orange with a two finger fluffy bright white head that fades fairly quickly to a 1/4 inch ring around the edge of the glass. Sticky webs of lacing everywhere. Smell is amazing. Dank citrus, most notably grapefruit and orange intertwine wonderfully with mango and pineapple notes of Julius. Taste is the same. The dankness makes this a bit less of a juice bomb than Julius, but still amazing. Feel is pillowy soft and juicy with a little tickle of the tongue on the finish. Overall another world class beer by Tree House. I actually like this slightly more than Julius. Also of all the Treehouse beers I've had, this is the best one to drink straight from the can."
"Curious beer - mouthfeel makes it. Super hopped for sure, but not quite the wack over the head as expected. Surprisingly piney and resiny. Nose is somewhat subdued. The malt warms up real nice - love some of the yeasty dryness too."
"I am team Julius all the way, so this is right in my wheelhouse. Crisp and juicy at the same time, with a refreshing finish. This is one of my favs from TH, and I will take this over Green any day."
"Pours a glowing cloudy golden orange color. Aroma is big and juicy citrus. Flavor citrusy and really nice, has a bit of an unripe pineapple note on the back end and I expected this to be a bit juicier. Still really good though. Overall this is a really good beer and I enjoyed it s lot."
The. Perfect. Beer.
"Second tree house offering for me, Green absolutely blew me away (my first). So I might make some references to green while drinking this. Let's see how this holds up."
"This is just an amazing beer. Most of the reviews regarding look, feel, smell and taste are accurate, so I won't take the time to repeat. Just know that if you have the chance to get this beer, do it."
"Pours a hazy dark orange in color with a a large, pillowy white head that exhibits good retention and leaves moderate amounts of sticky lacing."
"Perfection in a can. Canned and tasted today 4/6, purchased along with Green. Alter Ego is my favorite offering from Treehouse to date, but admittedly I have not tried any of their stouts or non-IPA offerings. Every aspect of this beer is outrageously good. Just go get some you knuckleheads!"
"I think that this is my favorite offering that I've tried from Tree House or it could be a tie with Very Hazy (tough to call). This beer looks amazing, a dark yellow almost orange hazy beer with a nice head. The smell is very citrus fruity and juicy. The taste is more of the same, citrus fruity and juicy with some melon added in for good measure. Very hoppy and super smooth at the same time. Mouthfeel is great, very complex. Amazing beer overall."
First offering from Tree House. Pours a thick head. Wonderful sweet aroma. Look is thick and golden. Taste is fruity/juicy and super smooth. I mean this has to be one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. This is as close to a perfect beer as I can remember having.
I've been wanting to try this for a long time. We'll worth the wait and the hype. Canned in March and poured into a snifter.
An underrated offering as I had this side by side with Green. It holds up. Alter Ego is super soft with floral and some piney notes. Very juicy middle but a clean finish. This APA is much simpler than others but the tangerines and mangoes really come through for me. Another masterpiece.
64 oz. growler shared by Matthew. Served alongside Julius. Many thanks!
"First off, if i could rate the mouth feel on this a ten i would."
This is easily one of my favorite brews. I was glad to have the opportunity to wait in line at Tree House to get it. Super easy drinking with a huge explosion in my mouth of all of what's good about awesome IPA's. I would recommend this great tasting beer to anyone. If you ever get a chance to visit Massachusetts stop at Tree House. You will not be disappointed.
"Sample size, maybe 3 to 4 oz. At the end of a tasting, but it was fantastic as expected."
"Can shared by Curran this weekend, thanks man. Not all that different from regular Julius, but I think it's a bit better."
"Second only to the Haze from Treehouse. This beats the Julius by far. This was an amazing batch, even shared it with my whole family from a growler. Citrus, Fruit, Pine. All good things you want in a beer."
"Ok, so I'm pretty new to the NE-style IPA craze. The haziness distinguishes this beer and the others like it at first glance, but it's just bs hipster facial hair. The juiciness is there in a big, beautiful way, but there's a graininess in my throat when I drink it that makes me hate the mid-fermentation hopping concept. If they would have let the yeast floc a little more before throwing the mosaic in, this would be a perfect IPA."
"Canned 3/02. Pours an awesome orange, hazy color with a finger head. Smell is tangerine, mango, blueberries, orange, tropical fruits. Taste is very similar with a very nice herbaceous note and grapefruit bitterness in the back. Mouthfeel is typical TH creaminess but Green still is #1 in this aspect."
"Hazy orange body with a thick, foamy off-white head. Aroma is big, juicy, citrusy hops, hints of tropical fruit and a hint of dank grass. Flavor is big and juicy as well, lots of tropical fruit and citrus flavors. Feel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, sticky lingering taste. A really nice IPA that has huge hop flavor."
Hazy orange juice with a delicate bright head.
Really deserving of all the hype. Hazy appearance. Mosaic and amarillo hops work perfectly together. Plenty of tropical fruit notes on the nose. Taste is so juicy. It's got a little dryness to it initially when taking a sip but super smooth and juicy ending. I could crush 10 of these without thinking twice about it. 
"Without a doubt the best IPA (and beer) I've ever tasted. I was lucky enough to try this before Tree House's flagship, Julius. My boss had brought me back a can and told me it was the best beer he's ever had. I obviously had my reservations, but after drinking it, I'm a believer. "
"Poured from a can into a teku. A little more bitter and less juicy than other TH offerings but retains the same typical TH (great) mouthfeel. Perhaps my second favorite 'regular' TH offering, with only Green exceeding the overall experience."
So much fruity citrusy awesomeness... just fantastic.
A fantastic citrusy IPA from Tree House. It might be my favorite of all of theirs.
appearance- Light yellow/orange color and hazy/turbid. No visibility whatsoever. Pours a thick/foamy two finger head.
Canned and reviewed 3/2/16
Thought this was definitely better than Julius.
Poured into a Duvel Tulip. 
"I go back and forth on whether I prefer this or Julius. That same amazing, creamy mouth feel that only comes from a Tree House IPA and so juicy. Each batch seems to somehow get better than the last."
Probably my favorite Treehouse beer.
"Poured from the 16 oz can dated 2/17/16 into a snifter glass. Comes out quite honey colored, lighter side of amber, very hazy with a decent head."
Pours a fairly dark orange color. Can smell it as soon as I pop the can. Has a super bright citrus nose. Pure hop candy. Mouthfeel is trademark Tree House...very creamy and coats the mouth. Leaves gorgeous lacing. I slighty prefer Julius but this is fantastic as well. I may shed a tear when I finish my last can.
"Received this beer as an extra in a trade. A ton of tropical fruit flavor up front, the malt is small but noticeable enough to balance out the hops. Very smooth and enjoyable. Pour is a light orange, sticky lacing, and totally opaque. Really enjoyable."
"Tasting notes primarily: Juicy fruit gum. Tons of tropical flavored backed by mild citrus. Pineapple, tangerine, grass, bubblegum, pine. This is really awesome. Great mouthfeel, as always from TH. One of my favorite Tree House beers."
typical treehouse brew. loads of dank tropical notes on nose followed by a soft mouthfeel and explosion of aforementioned flavors. very drinkable. true beauty
"L: Brilliant burnt orange color. Hazy, with a frothy white head that leaves beautiful lacing on the glass"
L - Like orange juice... With pulp. A beautiful thick golden haze.
"Julius with a Mosaic dry hop that softens the sweetness. A more complex, mature, ""grown-up"" Julius!"
"I tried this after trying a Green for the first time. I slightly preferred the Green (by the way, the best beer I've had in my life and I'm getting up there in years), but this is an outstanding IPA. The Mosaic hops shine through. The owners of Treehouse are artists."
"Canned and enjoyed the same day. Unreal fresh! Unlike many of its Tree House brethren, this baby pours a hazy liquid gold closer in look to apple juice than orange juice. I'm just coming out and saying it - the differences between Alter Ego, Juilius and Green are so slight and the beers far enough between sessions (for me at least) that it's tough for me to point out the differentiators. They're all fantastic beers so I really don't care which I have in hand, save for the ABV (lower the better since they all taste so big but feel so soft). World class, all of them. And they all seem to peak after a couple weeks in the fridge."
On par with every other hoppy brew i have had from Treehouse. keep the great coming
"My favorite Tree House beer! Soft mouth feel, nose is full of citrus, mango, and guava. Flavor is also full of tropical fruits. Had it out of the can so had a thin white lacy head. Keep it up guys, great stuff!"
Can poured into a tree house snifter
Drank this one after Julius. Very solid IPA. well made. very refined in my opinion. Drank it out of a glass. good citrusy smell. Tree House has the IPA thing figured out
reviewing side by side w doppleganger. darker in color w more head on the pour. nose is amazing tropical fruit and orange. taste is little thin up fRont w papaya mango and citrus juice following. I love this beer. I think better than julius.
"Hazed apricot colored with a half inch of orangey off-white foam that settles out to a quarter inch cap that lingers long. Inviting aroma of citrus and florals, ripe stone fruit and bubble gum. Well-balanced flavors of chewy malt and a hop flourish. Lots of flavors in the hops - citrus, pine, tangerine, mint, a bit of chive/onion. Moderate to assertive bitterness, but a good balance. Full and rich mouthfeel, a bit chewy. Great beer."
Look: Beautiful orange glow
"A - Alter Ego pours a very opaque and orange. The head is head is medium and white, with significant lasting time. The appearance is very cloudy, and easily resembles a hazy and ghostly orange juice. "
"Differs by batch. Golden orange completion with balance of citrus hops. Very smooth, very drinkable IPA"
"This is a great beer, but as a regular TH drinker, it is honestly one of my least favorites. Don't get me wrong, I would take this over nearly 99 percent of the remaining options out there, but I would much rather spend my money on Julius or Green out the ""regular"" releases. If you have had TH, you know what to expect: hops, juice, and haze. Cheers."
My first Tree House brew and I really liked it. Nice hop character with a bitternes that is not too pervasive but rather sets off the fruity characteristics nicely.
"16 oz can, canned on 10/29/2015."
"Just an outstanding example of the quality treehouse is pumping out of the northeast right now! Hazy,hoppy,dense and dank, need I say more?"
A- Pours a very hazy and very orange as it hits the glass. A huge head forms and retains a very long time with tremendous lacing. The pour is so orange and hazy that it could be mistaken for a glass of very pulpy orange juice.
"this is definitive proof for me that the east coast ipa has overtaken the west coast, at least for my palate and what i like. these hazy, rich feeling, juicy, seemingly wheat based hoppy beers that lack any real bitterness, its just a totally different take, and i love it. this is only my second beer from these guys, but its easily the better of the two. a very pale washed out looking straw colored brew with an inch of white head that slowly relaxes but is easily brought back with a gentle twirl of the glass. the nose, oh baby the nose. tons of hops on it, juicy and tropical, pineapple and lemon, amarillo for sure, the mosaic a little less obvious i think, but both there working together beautifully. dry cereal malt base, light in aroma and flavor but with a lot of structure for the feel. its creamy and bigger feeling, expansive but pillow soft, well carbonated but not explosive. its about as well refined as any ipa out there, and certainly deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as beers like heady topper and abner and the trillium stuff. its just fantastic, the best use of these two hops i have known, and i am absolutely frothing for more tree house beers. this is nothing short of stunning. nearly perfect ipa really, i could drink 100 of these."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange amber color with fairly good head retention and decent lacing. The nose is fairly typical for TH IPA's and DIPA's, which is wonderful if you love this style of IPA/DIPA (and I do). There is considerable grapefruit and orange citrus, with some underlying dank earth, tropical fruit and light pine. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with some nice light bitterness on the finish, but with some noticeable heat from alcohol as well. Given the relatively low abv., I was surprised by the noticeable heat I got on the finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with a fairly full, citrus infused finish. As is typical with TH IPA's and DIPA, the beer was soft and almost creamy on the palate (which is not something I typically expect to find in an IPA, and is not something I'm sure I'm entirely in love with)."
12/10/15 date into tulip glass. Oge retla 
"Like all other Tree House hops, this one is phenomenal. It pours a little more clear than the others and does not quite have the same hop bite, but is still super juicy and dank."
dont like the deep haze in the pour but a nice aroma and delightful citrus flavor. the grapefruit is light and fluffy. this is a really nice IPA. not sure how it's rated above Sip of Sunshine etc... but it's very good.
"Look - hazy orange, with a foamy white head. This one seems to foam a bit more than the other TH's beers I've had."
"I drank this without knowing all the background on it. It certainly makes sense because I liked it even more than Julius personally. Pineapple, melon, and tangerine are the highlights of the hop profile. Nice and oily on the tongue with a west coast style body."
"After having several people tell me that Alter Ego was superior to Julius, I made a point to seek it out and was helped by fellow BA carps4. Enjoyed on 12/17/15 out of a tallboy with a canning date of 12/11/15--can't really beat an IPA that hasn't even reached it's one-week birthday. Poured into an IPA-specific Speigelau glass."
"Beautiful, hazy, burnt orange color with two finger fluffy white head. Smell is huge burst of pineapple with citrus and some herbal notes. Taste follows with pineapple, grapefruit, mango, some herbal and grassy notes. Mouth feel is pillowy and full up front. Carb is low. Overall, it's a great IPA worth trading for."
"Enjoyed side-by-side with Julius, from equally fresh growlers. Thanks CJ!"
"Man this really is devil Julius!!! Another home run for Treehouse and their Julius ""variants"". The thing I love about these all are the hazy cloudy orange-ness that come w these- so citrus-y and dangerously crushable! Seek w confidence. Worth mentioning: my friends describe it as tit juice. Idk, just saying..."
Poured at 47°F from a can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"Can really smell the mosaic hops on this one, batch from 12/10, drank 12/19. Prefer this to Julius, is up there with Green, so tasty!"
"Looks, smells, and tastes like a Treehouse beer. Really can't go wrong here and they are the most consistent brewery out there. I'm not sure I'd give it quite the rating of Julius/Green, but this one was excellent."
"It's not the eye-opener that Julius was for me, but Alter Ego still stands on its own as a very drinkable IPA. If it were readily available, this could easily become a go-to."
750ml growler poured into snifter. Fresh. About 12 oz. pour.
Delicious
"Look: Light orange, very cloudy, quick fading head, some lacing"
A: Hazy peach. Orange mist. Smooth but fizzy off-white head. 
"Pours a hazey Orange with a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. As sooon as you crack the can your hit with a powerful hop aroma, similar to the aroma that hits you when you walk into Tree House. Lot of tropical fruit and hop dankness. Such an amazing beer."
"Extremely cloudy, peachy-orange brew, topped by a flat white head of good size, with fantastic retention. The brew is completely opaque, with only shadows visible behind the glass."
Canned 11-19-15
"Another excellent brew from Tree House! I seriously need to take a trip to visit them because their beers are simply amazing and delicious! A great beer that is well balanced, I need to do another trade to get me some more of these!"
"Julius' ""Alter Ego"". Basically Julius with a different dry hop, giving it a much more dank taste profile."
"This is my first Treehouse offering and oh man does it live up the hype. Saw another reviewer below indicate they didn't think it was as hoppy as an east coast IPA, but I have to disagree. This one is a pallet cleanser. But it's also very easy to drink and just tastes amazing. This makes me want to try Julius even more"
"My first taste of a Tree House brew. This came with considerable hype of course. It did not disappoint. Very smooth - tasty brew. Extremely easy to drink, go's down nice. Nice flavor throughout. Not quite the hop smack I'm used to in east coast IPA's but a very good beer. Making the trip to Treehouse soon and hope to score some."
Lots of hops! Gloriousness in a metal can! Loved this one! Been wanting to try it forever so I am glad I was able to and will be looking for more for sure!!
"Shared a couple of Tree House beers with my brother. Pours a translucent orange, great citrus/fruity aroma. Taste reminds me of Heady, but a notch below Julius."
Very good.
"I really hoped this would eclipse Julius, but it hasn't. It's really good, tasty as hell, but lacking the citrusy punch. Sweet mango, guava and orange make there way through your palate, some grapefruit as well, none of the citrus is in your face or overwhelming. Has the same fluffy mouthfeel as Julius. Very good, but there are lots of better ipas"
"Thanks Kegatron for sharing this pounder can with us. Poured into a snifter, the brew appears a hazy copper color with a yellowish strained head that persists."
"Surprised to say this may have knocked Julius down from my favorite TH beer. Huge citrus up front, crisp slightly sweet finish. Can't get enough of this beer"
By far my favorite Tree House has to offer. 
"Poured 11/29/15 from a 750ml growler that was filled at the brewery on 11/27/15, into an imperial pint glass."
"Pours a hazy orange with a nice white head. Not quite Trillium level haze, but hazier than most ipas by a fair margin. Hazier than the 1 day younger Julius opened just prior."
Appearance: Light copperish gold. Hazy with a super creamy moderate off-white head. Leaves sheets of lacing with big sticky notches. Moderate carbonation on the pour. Solid retention leaves a small clumpy cap that covers the top for the duration.
"Can from psweendogg. Thanks, Patrick!"
Consumed 11/27/15
"Citrus fruits, tangerine, orange pith and rind up front. Dank, pine bitterness on the back end. Medium, lingering finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Nice amount of sweetness. This is good."
Out of this world! Everything about this beer is phenomenal!
Service: Can
Poured from a growler filled the same day.
Obvious citrus aroma when opening the can.
"Nov 10 2015 bottle, opened Nov 21 2015"
"I actually like this more than Julius, but its splitting hairs."
750ml growler into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Look:
"Wow! Phenomenal beer! Just like with Julius, a very smooth and citrusy IPA that makes you want more! Only downside, they run out of this quickly when it's available."
"Canned 9/23/15, so just shy of two months old. Might taste better if fresh, but I felt like it was one of the worst beers thru do. Still solid and better than most IPA's"
A: Pours an insanely hazy burnt orange color with a two finger off-white head. Tons of lace spackled down the glass with each sip. Looks pretty amazing.
"Enjoyed from a growler filled 11-6. Has that distinct treehouse taste and smell. Misses the mark just slightly when compared to Julius, but adds its own dank qualities that mark it unique. An incredible beer."
"This 16oz can poured into my TH Teku glass looks like a hazy no pulp orange juice, so beautiful. Smell of citrus and juicy fruit. Taste like a dank juicy hop goodness, light piney finish thats smooth and compliments the fruit. Feels like a creamy TH beer should top notch. Overall this is one great beer so happy I got this sent to WI fresh."
Everything I had from treehouse is excellent so far.
L: dark hazy orange with half a finger of white foam
Poured from a 750mL can into a treehouse tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery 5 days ago. 
Poured from a week old can into a tulip:
"looks like a hazy orange color, smells delightfully citrusy. Tastes just like a Julius by Treehouse with a little tiny bit of a bite at the end. This beer is fantastically awesome as are all of the Treehouse brews."
Had a fresh can last night. Drank on a few occasions before. Typical Tree House turbid bright orange look and a citrus aroma. Great hop forward citrus flavor. Toned down juiciness from Julius with the different dry hop. Another winner. So happy this is in the regular rotation.
Served into a Teku from 16 oz can. Compared side by side with Julius
Enjoyed about one month ago. Tastes like what I'd imagine a mix of 1/2 Julius and 1/2 Haze to taste like. Very juicy!
"Look - Completely hazed, murky, gorgeous honey color. Beautiful beer per TH usual "
Pours that same opaque orange juice like look as Julius. Aroma has the same oranges and ripe mango/peaches as Julius but with even more awesome earthy dankness. I also get a hint of onion and herbs which isn't a bad thing at all here. Flavor spot on and similar to Julius again (obviously) but with more citrus and grapefruit pith.
"Growler. Pours hazy like Tree House does. Aroma is mashed up, squished tropical fruits. Alter Ego is Julius with different hops. It's smells and tastes very different. Julius is incredibly fruity but it's more aggressive than this beer. Alter Ego is softer and sweeter but still very tropical tasting. The Mosaic hops surprisingly aren't very oniony, or herby. Super fruity. Each sip begs for more. Surprised by the alcohol content. It could easily sneak up on you. A great example of a hop bomb that tastes rather soft and doesn't blast away with bitterness."
If you've ever had Julius this is similar but with spicy and stone fruit flavors. Delicious fresh cut tangerine and peach with spice flavors is what I got out of this. Very little bitterness. Almost like fruit juice on roids.
"Pours a dark gold, but dull and hazy. It's not bright. Off-white head. The is some tropical fruit aroma. I get a lot of the underlying papaya and unripe mango. There is the intermittent bursts of creamy pineapple from the mosaic hops. The mouth feel is soft. Overall, I liked this better than Julius, but it's not my favorite IPA."
Pours hazy in a pint glass. That smell is amazing. Wonderful notes of hoppy citrus goodness. Taste is juicy up front with mango and pineapple. Finishes dry on the pallet. A really good beer from Tee House.
16oz can poured into a globe.
L: Hazy orange that almost glows. Creamy white head with nice spotty lacing.
I have yet to have the Julius but this beer reminds me of The Heady Topper but with less punch to it.. This here is a great beer
This beer is very similar to Julius and where they used almost the exact same recipe bit altered the dry hop process and you can taste the difference. The look and smell is very similar but the taste seems to be much more crisp. It's worthy of high praise and a true joy to drink. Cheers.
"Poured from can into a tulip. Smell of orange hit me right away. Very beautiful orange haze in the glass. Citrus wasn't too overpowering but definitely solid. Worth the hype, can't believe this brewery was in my backyard and I waited so long to try."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA"
"16 oz can. Hazy orange color with two finger white head, fades into some clumps leaving tons of lace. Aroma is citrus pulp with some tropical fruit, jumps out the glass. Outstanding balance of sweet and bitterness in the taste. Deep dank hops with citrus peel, pine, fruit and some earthiness in the finish. The pine lingers well past the swallow. Mouthfeel is full, semi-soft. This brew is up there with the best."
Really good beer. Love the citrus kick!
"Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a nice one-finger frothy white head that lasts nicely throughout. Delicious aromatics of mango, tangerine, floral, and sweet malts. The Mosaic and Amarillo hops really come through on the palate. I definitely could pick up that that Julius dry hop, which I understand the base beer is exactly the same, but the dry hop is altered tremendously with an added citrusy complexity. Impeccable beer!"
pours a hazy golden brown with a two finger head. leaves plenty of lacing in the glass and good flavor on the palate. the hop taste is very pleasant without being overly bitter. the beer has a clean well balanced finish that leaves the drinker wanting more. defiantly worthy of the ratings.
This truly is a 5 star beer. This looks and smells like Julius but it tastes even better. Alter ego is less juicy but crisper and sweeter than Julius. It tastes lighter and has a clean well balanced finish that leaves the drinker begging for more. Favorite beer.
"Can into a brandy sniffer. Pours a orange with a slight shade of brown to it. Slightly burnt orange. Full finger of fluffy white head that lingered leaving nice lacing. 4.5. Smells of oranges, mangos, grapefruit or passion fruit and hops. 4.25. Tastes citrus forward. Lots of mosaic and Amarillo hops but it is also blended with the Julius hops. Great because it toned down the back end bitterness of Julius. Really smooth and drinkable. Not sweet but not bitter. Smooth. 4.5. Mouth feel is thick and full for an American IPA. Really nice. 4.5. Excellent beer."
"For my personal tastes, one of the better IPAs Ive had. Drinks way too damn easy. Love the Mosaic dry hop, gives it an intense citrus punch in the face and a nice sharp finish. Really, really great beer"
"This is an incredible brew. I think it takes the cake over Julius, taste and aroma are both far more intense, in my opinion."
"Hours old 16oz can. Poured hazy and golden with tropical fruit and citrus on the nose; not much of a head at all. Definitely could taste the Mosaic in this batch, nice piney little bite at the end. Prefer Julius but loved it. Tree House can't do wrong, I swear."
"16 oz can straight from the brewery in Monson, MA. Poured into a snifter with a hazy orange color and two finger head. It smells somewhat similar to Julius but obviously has added Amarillo and Mosaic hops. The taste is quite amazing! If you are a fan of Julius, Amarillo hops or Mosaic hops, this one is for you! But beware as this one is extremely drinkable. Overall this one landed high on my all-time favorite list. Just straight deliciousness!"
I've drank a lot of treehouse beers. Their pale ales and IPAs are all starting to taste the same. Their beers are starting to taste like Dean mowed the field and threw grass clipping in each batch. I like mowing lawns and I rather enjoy grass clippings.
"Another nice beer from tree house. Smell the hops pops , really liking the mix of hops although I'm not a Hugh mosaic fan. Really nice drinker over the heavy ipas"
"Had this and Julius side by side. This is a nice beer, but nowhere close to the original. Not nearly as over the top juicy as Julius. It's difficult to stack up next to the original and this suffers a bit in comparison."
Very well done. Nice malt background. Good hop choices. But not breathtaking.
Dark golden orange with a thick foamy head. Laces like nobody's business. The smell emerges from the crack of the can. Light speed to the nose before you even see the beer. Vibrant mosaic citrus with some dank pine from the Amarillo. Aggressively hopped orange and grapefruit juice mix. Slightly high carbonation. Acidity really hits along with the hop oil.
"Had this out of a growler not too long ago, now able to sit down with a can and review thanks to cbutova. Canned on date is 8-19-15."
"It was hard to say which one I liked better; Julius or Alter Ego. Had them both side by side and I believe they were relatively similar aged. Overall, the Alter Ego version won out for me. Both great IPA's, but this one was even smoother and more enjoyable."
"Not as chewy and orange juicy as a Trillium ipa, but wonderfully sweet and bitter; hoppy and malty. Big flavor, lots of citrus juice."
"Wow. Pours a gorgeous hazy orange with a thick white head that lingers throughout, some lacing on the glass. Smell is exploding with hops, the mosaic comes through strong. Mosaic also shines through on the taste, nice orange/tropical flavors as well. Smooth as most of their other beers, great mouthfeel. Absolutely excellent."
"This is just a delicious beer. A lot of the hype for this brewery goes to Julius, but I think that this one just edges it out. Obviously it is a variation, and the Mosaic and Amarillo are present and exactly what I like. Dank, citrusy and easy to drink!"
16oz Can.
"Can from the brewery, a few days old."
Pours a murky deep orange color with a two finger off-white head. Typical New England IPA appearance.
Dank with a mosaic character that seems to come through most in the taste. Like Julius its nice and juicy but adds almost a fruit pitch character that I really like.
"Love this, nudges out Julius."
"This beer is better than Julius. A few IPAs are better than Julius. Not many IPAs are better than this. Fantastic blend of pine, citrus and malt. Nice resinous nose with plenty of citrus hops. Flavor is much of the same. Sweetness is 'fruit-like' instead of 'malt-like'. "
"My first thought on this beer is boring, followed by perfectly done. It's reminiscent of the simpler IPAs of a few years ago, less so the more complex/exciting IPAs being put out now by Tree House and others. Color is a hzay orange, but not cloudy. Smell is smooth with a hop presence, but not overwhelming. Taste is refreshing and slightly hoppy, but very simple. Finish has a standard (but not overpowering) hop finish. I prefer the sweeter/funner IPAs more, but this was very well done."
I love treehouse . The hops always have a super smoothness that I have come to expect from them . thanks
"My god. Julius' Alter Ego is the man/woman!! the aroma of this isn't over powering, but it not going to kick you in the vag/nuts like some super hop aroma beers, but it's still something I would love in candle scent for my flat. This isn't a tea bag you in the mouth IPA, this isn't super malty like some regular IPAs can be, but it's just a very well balanced IPA. I'm not a big IPA fan but this hit the spot for me. Being in Tampa, I'm used to the maltier IPAs, so this was a refreshing change. I love the look of this. Nice and hazy. It felt great as Julius danced on my tongue and slid down my throat with little burn."
From 08/28/15 notes. Canned on 08/19/15. 16 oz. can into a tulip.
Alter Ego...
An awesome opportunity to get some of these beers. Let's see how this one compares to Julius. 16 oz. can into a tulip.
Julius with a mosaic twist. This beer has all of the same orange citrus flavors going on as julius but with an emphasis on some tropical fruit flavors. Still turbid glowing orange with a medium and soft mouthfeel. Treehouse is killing it lately
"Julius's dry hopped better brother IMO. Clean, full mouth feel. Juicy as can be. Delicious!"
Pours an lmost fluorescent orange with a fluffy head the dissipates fairly quickly.
"I mean, does Nate ever have a bad day when creating a new brew? I wish I could buy stock in this guy. Anyhow, this is the type of beer that you would expect from Tree House - incredible aroma, lots of fruit taste, a soft finish. This stepbrother of Julius is a winner, hands down!"
L: A dark hazy orange with bright white head
"I constantly find myself splitting hairs when reviewing any offering from Tree House. With each having their own unique qualities, I have yet to consume a TH beer without enjoying every sip. With that being said ""Alter Ego"" is one of my personal favorites. A Julius clone - this beer packs a juicy punch similar to it's older brother with a well-balanced finish. Do yourself a favor and visit Tree House."
"Look- almost identical to Julius, just slightly hazier"
Look - Hazy golden beer with a slight orange color. A good finger of fluffy head that left some sticky lacing.
"This is certainly Julius with a kick. A nice earthy Mosaic slap in the nostrils. Does the base beer justice. This is as drinkable as Julius, a touch fruitier, and more pungently aromatic. A great drinking experience!"
Pours a dark orange with a bright white head that falls away to a ring quickly. 
Look - Hazy golden beer with a slight orangish glow from the bottom of the glass. A good finger of fluffy head that left some sticky lacing.
The Evil Twin of Julius.. Can't put my finger on it .. Something about it is better than Julius on the finish.
"Julius Topper. I had this from a can in a glass. The look and the head are pretty much Julius, i.e opaque orange, nice thick white head, lacing on the glass, etc... The smell is packed with fruit and citrus. You get all of the juiciness of Julius to start, but then the flavor gives way to waves of bitter hops which in turn give way to more citrus, grapefruit aftertaste - very nice. Nice silky mouthfeel."
"Julius' evil twin. I like it a lot, but definitely prefer Dr J."
"Seriously? This is like the next level of where a single IPA can go. Citrus is bursting with this. Upon opening the can, the room fills with the most delicious hop aromas. Way too easy to drink. Could pair perfectly with your morning cereal, a total OJ substitute. Have not yet had Julius. Not sure how it could be better."
poured from growler purchased on 8/20/15 at Tree House
"This is the real deal right here. Very similar to Julius, but it lacks a tad in mouthfeel."
Canned on 8/19/15; drank on 8/20/15 in a Tree House teku glass
From a 16 oz. can purchased at the brewery.
"excellent beer for my taste is better than julius, sorry julius. i love u too"
my favorite Tree House beer to date....easy to drink citrus juice bomb.....perfection at its best
These guys don't make bad beer...
"Looks cloudy orange and pours with a one finger head. Smells chock-full of citrus and piney hops. Taste is intensely citrus with an incredibly smooth bitter finish. Certainly citrus-filled, blast of mosaic, peppery. Mouth feel has a slight tingle and refreshingly clear-finish that leaves a little bit of bitterness on the back of the tongue. Overall, fantastic. This is almost like a bite from a bouquet of tropical fruits and it leaves you feeling rejuvenated and still possesses that classic IPA dry hoppy bite. Highly recommended."
Couple weeks old and still phenomenal. Reminds me of some of the curiosity beers that they have come out with in the past. Lots of fruits on the nose and taste. Hopes this becomes a regular.
"I must be crazy but I think I liked this better than Julius. Alter Ego is a little sweeter and fruitier/citrusy than Julius and not as subtle of a beer. Julius is almost like orange peel/zest while Alter Ego is a mix of that and the actual fruit flesh. To me, it's just as drinkable. The mouthfeel is crisper... honestly, the only place Julius has a clear heads up on Alter Ego is in the nose, which a little more muted in this beer."
Second favorite beer  to green by a small margin
750ml filled July 11th.
Poured from a 16 oz can straight from the brewery. 
Beautiful murky orange color
Love the amarillo you get in this dry hopping.. they need to do that again to Julius.. Mosaic always brings amazingness but I really am digging the amarillo. Fantastic brew... of course- upgraded to 4.75 in this last batch.. top 20 beer ever for me
"Side by side, I preferred Julius."
"Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Festival., notes redone from can."
A very good IPA. Hoppy with a wonderful bitter after taste. This beer is truely the alter ego of Juluis. It has a wonderful citrus flavor not as smooth and sweet as Juluis but very good.
"L - a dark, brooding orange. Turbid and angry-looking. I can see the beginnings of Devil Julius!"
Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Reviewed from notes. 
The beer comes in a dark orange color.
"Had a 750 growler of this last night. It was a great beer, very similar to Julius just slightly less drinkable! Overall definitely worth a higher rating then portrayed on here!"
Devil Julius--dank and dry. Wonderful.
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. This is apparently Julius with Amarillo and Mosaic hops added somewhere.
Thanks for the can Kevin!
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold. Aroma of orange, pineapple and tropical fruits. Taste is well balanced with tons of tropical and citrus fruit. Orange, melon, mango, pineapple. Delicious"
"Pours a gleaming, turbid pale orange. Creamsicle like. Thick bright white head on heavy pour. Nose is packed with bright fresh citrus. Orange, grapefruit and lemon. Juice like if you will. Taste loses me a bit for one reason only, it’s hot. Really boozy is this one! There is tasty notes of citrus and hints of stone fruits along with sweet dough buried under all that boozyness tho. So I can’t too much. I just think it’s pretty green and it’s definitely a can you could sit on for a month in hops the heat is tamed. Thick creamy body with a hoppy hot finish. It’s hot!!! That’s all I got."
Got the last glass from the last keg. Soo bomb!
Best Triple IPA that I've ever had.
"Could not tell this was a 10% TIPA. Absolute juice bomb!! Damn good brew. Top 3 triple for me, easily. Full of citrus aromatics and flavor. The hop saturation in this really hides the abv well."
"16oz can, snifter glass. Pours a bright pulpy yellow body, slight settling orange hue; one finger thick white head, good retention and rings of lacing despite the high ABV. As soon as I pull the tab back, it seems like the aroma was being barely held in by the aluminum, and bursts out in wafts of massive grapefruit, citrus and miscellaneous tropical fruits. Maaaasive fruit bomb that ultimately settles a little bit when the caramel and dextrin malt kicks in a fair dose of sweetness. This is probably the best, if not one of the best, hop aromas I've had the fortune to smell. Flavour is more of a balance of a big sugary dextrin, and relatively light (though not insubstantial) caramel sweetness added to the big tropical fruit and citrus bite. Excellent. Even adds a warming feeling to the back of my throat and stomach from the relatively high ABV. Mouthfeel is medium bodied although it remains not too thin or watery, with a big balance of sugary and hoppy depth backing things up on the backend, mild-moderately bitter with a decent warming heat on the backend. Overall, a massive citra bomb with a warming finish. It's everything you expect from a triple IPA, although you expect a little more body to it, I'm really not going to complain."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a small white head that recedes immediately. It has low carbonation. The beer smells peaches, apricots, lemon, and orange. It tastes of peaches, apricots, kumquats, lemon, and orange. The feel is medium light. A good IPA from trillium."
"If strong hoppy cloudy IPAs are your thing, look no further. This is it."
5oz pour at the brewery. 
Served into a tulip at Trillium canton tasting room.
Everything’s fine in the big time. Amazing tropical aromas and flavors. Full mouthfeel. No alcohol burn at all. Drank in a teku on 9/1. It is a little green. I’m going to try to let the rest sit for a few days.
"Poured from a can in a teku. Label is cool with some metallic highlights. Pours a milky pale orange with a finger finger of short lived frothy white head. Aroma is full of orange, pineapple, and mango. Taste is also heavy on the citrus and tropical fruits and adds some melon. A bit juicy upfront, very smooth throughout. Some sweetness but not overwhelming or cloying. As the beer warms I get a bit of alcohol in the nose and some in the finish but still well hidden for 10% ABV. Medium-full bodied but not as heavy as a Triple IPA could be. Very tasty and drinkable, great beer. My wife LOVES this."
16 oz. canned on 08/28/18
Just a straight up amazing TIPA. It’s an orange and mango bomb. Maybe the smoothest 10%+ IPA I’ve had. Booze is nearly undetectable. There’s a hint of greenness but it’s not ruining the beer. Was going to trade away a 4-pack but I think I may hold it all.
"Didn’t have the West Coast version, but there is definitely no east coast west coast beef here! So good!"
"Pours an opaque orange that turns into a murky burnt-orange when the final ounces are poured from the can into the glass. Head formation is pretty good, netting a finger and a half of white foam. Head has good retention. Aroma is orange peel, tangerine, papaya, lemongrass, and melon-dew. There is a light biscuit malt note, but faint compared with the onslaught of hops. Flavor profile is dripping with hops, without being very soupy or confused. Hops hit notes of orange peel, tangerine, mango, papaya, and lemon zest. Biscuit and bread malts form a firm foundation and actually show throw the dense curtain of hops, making for a well balanced DIPA. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a lightly grainy texture. Overall, a great double-dry hopped NE IPA, showing good balance despite having an absolute onslaught of hop notes from the get-go. Mouth feel is not chalky, which makes it much better than other well-known NE IPA producers' double-dry hopped offerings."
"01/2017 - One of the better Other Half IPAs I've had to date; combines the big ethanol quality of that I've come to expect from OH with the fruity, zesty, yet still hoppy qualities reminiscent of NEIPAs."
On tap at OH. Really enjoyed this one.
"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn. "
"No canned on date! Bummer, but It’s from the 8/11 release."
"Probably the best all round hops I’ve had. So so drinkable with the signature other half mouth feel. Tropical fruit on the nose and mouth, can’t say enough how soft this is. A masterpiece"
Can received in trade
DDH Mylar Bags - Other Half
Shelton Bros Festival
"Look: super hazy, yellowish orange in color with a thick creamy 1 inch head "
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) bag into a conical pint glass; production date 11/18/18.
Tasting from a 10 day old freshly opening growler filled at the brewery.
"Tall can, date is miss stamped on the bottom....from the brewery today."
12 Jul 17 backlog from untappd. mylar bags was my number one from other half until this baby came along. this is the beer i think of when frank gallagher is brewing the milk of the gods in the basement on shameless. great beer.
Thick and creamy citrus. Almost like an orange sherbet. Hazy and frothy appearance. Strong zesty notes in the aroma. Drinks so smooth and flavorful. Dreamsicle in a glass without the sweetness!
One of the best NEIPA out there
"This one pours a hazy murky yellow-ish color, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Poured from a can into.12oz snifter, dated 3/21/2018"
"drinking this at over a month old as I received in a trade past optimal freshness. pours out a hazed golden color with a dense and creamy bright white head that leaves excellent lacing. nose is somewhat subdued, some dank and citric notes playing with a sweetish malt quality. on palate it pops a little more, and brings ripe mango, soft peach, grapefruit, orange, herbaceous grassy note, sweet bready malts, danky earth, and a mellow hit of slightly resinous pine on the finish. super well balanced and rounded, perhaps due in part to the age. would love to try this fresh but hot dayummm this one held up nicely, cheers!"
"This beer pours a completely opaque, super murky, golden orange color with a two finger, creamy, frothy white head. Retention is above average and there are tons of chunky rings and patches of lacing left all over the glass."
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
Nearly Perfect IPA
L - Hazy darker orange and a finger of white head
"A 1 pint can, canned on 2nd August 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass."
"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma has milky yeast and a combination of juicy and grassy hops. Taste is juicy, hoppy, dank and grassy, really well balanced overall."
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Thanks Big Julius for the hookup.
"Damn! This is one solid beer! A solid /yellow orange color. Not hazy. Just solid color. Aroma was super complex with all the hops that they used. Dank papaya, pineapple, oatiness, bready, melon, mandarin, grapefruit. Fun to smell! Taste was pretty complex also, but a bit lesser than nose. Still, citrus, earthy, pineapple, melon. And mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Danky citrus dry finish. Definitely world class and deserving to be among the top IPAs out there."
"Tasted from can. Pours a super murky yellow orange. Looks like fruit juice. Huge fruity aroma. Lots of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, melon. Excellently balanced. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit flavor similar to nose with some pine and resin. Complex and great tasting IPA."
"Pineapple, orange/tangerine, grapefruit aroma. Huge juicy tropical hop taste w a nice medium hop bite/bitterness. Incredible tropical juicy feel. My first OH beer...I need more!"
"From fresh can into IPA glass, Cloudy as expected, has nice retention with killer lacing. Smells ok slight earth and grainy with some lemon zest. Tastes is incredible! Not too bitter, not too citrusy, just right. Nice semi sweet aftertaste. Great thick juicy feel. Best I've had yet of this NE DIPA style. Had this side by side with Trilium's version and though DDH Congress Street smelled much better this is way better tasting and feels much better. Perfectly executed 4.80"
Would have been perfect if not for the yeast cake on the bottom. Still fantastic.
This hits on all cylinders. With multiple tropical fruit flavors combining sharp hop powder tongue combing mouthfeel with an intense aroma of papaya and mango. Shit be on point.
"Other Half's best yet. Typical hazy appearance and decent semi-lasting foamy head, with a burst of tropical fruity goodness on the nose and palate. Slightly sweeter than some of the other less notable OH IPAs."
Canned two weeks ago.
"Had a can dropped off from Justin he got on trade and shared it with John G. It pours a bright yellow hazy color, and smells of tropical island paradise. It tastes like an alcoholic tropical hoppy beer slushy, and the body isn't far off from that. Will definitely seek out again!"
"Juicy as all get out in smell, tatse, and feel. The look is murky OJ! All their DDH stuff is usually killer and worth seeking out!"
"Look: Yellow, hazy, turbid, with 1 inch head."
"Opaque light orange pour, thumbs worth of head, strong lacing. Mango, pineapple, leaves, grass in the aroma and taste. Slightly catty, fairly resinous. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel."
While I will admit I think OH is slightly over hyped this is a really good beer. Pours golden and hazy. Nice aroma and very smooth. I might not rate it as high as others but maybe that's because being in NNJ I get cans almost every week and a lot of them taste extremely similar. That's not a horrible thing.
"The nose is incredible, so full of fruit. It pours extremely hazy. This is straight up orange juice with some mango notes possibly. It's delicious and super drinkable."
From Untappd
Pours hazey opaque golden orange with large fluffy head.
"32oz growler. Pours an opaque bright pale yellow with over an inch of frothy head. Good amount of lacing. The nose is loads of juicy fruits. Pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lime, guava, papaya and peach. The taste is more of the fruit flavors. Peach, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and lime. Sweet and juicy. Maybe a hint of dank hops. Sugary, peachy finish along with some bread. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. A bit oily mouthfeel. Fair amount of alcohol heat. Another amazing Double Dry Hopped beer by a great brewery. I like DDH Mosaic Dream just a tiny bit better than this one, but this brew is outstanding in its own right."
Super juice and haze bomb. Excellent representation of a DDH New England IPA. So juicy and hazy. Full and thick mouthfeel. Excellent beer by other Half.
5/5/2017 can drank on 5/18/2017
"This bad boy is why I love Other Half so much! Not all of their DDH stuff is ridiculous but this one absolutely is! Juicy, hazy and dank! Great back end bite! Amazing!"
Another kick ass other1/2
Canned 5/5/17; drnak 5/12/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"hot dog!!! without a doubt a top 3 or top 5 from other half's vast catalog of IPAs. I've had some other batches but this can is from this past weekends release and it is as good if not better than my memory tells me previous batches were. really a quintessential NE IPA. hits all the marks...hazy appearance, smell and taste that rival minute maid, and a fresHess dripping gooey hop. really marvellous. this is one to keep an eye out for and snag when it comes out. winner winner chicken dinner."
"Absurdly perfect NE IPA. Unfiltered hazy orange coloration, check! Dank fruit bomb on the nose, check! Candied peaches on the tongue, check! Lingering soft mouthfeel, check! Basically, go drink this thing."
The best beer out of Other Half. The balance between hops and grain is perfect. This is beer goes toe to toe with anything from Alchemist and is better then almost all from Tree House.
"My can says 8.5% abv. Other Half's best offering imho. Total juice bomb! Orange rind, pineapples, looks like mango juice, tastes like it too!"
Pours a darker orangish color with a nice lacing head of about 1 inch. Smells of pineapple and tropical fruit. Has a nice pineapple up front taste followed by a nice bitter finish. Smooth thick mouthfeel. Excellent.
"Can't get much orange brown murkier than this. Like what a swamp would look like in a Beatles song. Head wasn't especially special, as the two fingers of white foam died off to a slippery but lazy lacing curtain. Nose has two main things at work, candied dried pineapple and candied dried pineapple. There's just a bit of grassy around the edges, along with a splash of that hop spice thing. Taste is a huge sweet, sharp, hot, easy drinking bundle of happy. Initially, what was pineapple in the nose takes on more of melon taste. Still candied, but just mustier in a way than pineapple. Get a bit further in and there's that bit of grassy just milliseconds before the heat flows in. Finish is sweet but from the hot, and has a bit of silkiness upon exit. Terrific beer!"
"3/9 canning... It's like candied pineapple-grapefruit juice beer - bitter and tangy, sweet and juicy - fruity and smoothie - and every time I've had a double-dry hopped beer, I get something of a pixie dust/sweetarts candy powder impression, and then I'm plunged back into the beer. Some really great shit going on over at Other Half - all their New England-style beer, double dry hopping and lupulin powder dusting. Regular Mylar Bags was incredible, but this somehow ups the ante... Hopped with Amarillo, Galaxy, Citra, Mosaic and El Dorado hops, then Citra and Mosaic lupulin powders, and then even more Galaxy hops. Ridiculously good."
"This is the jammiest beer that has passed my gullet. This belongs in the Trillium offering but it has its own profile. The nose is heavy of orange and mango. I expected a bite, but that bite is replaced by sweet orange rinds. This is the juice bomb everyone is after. Phenomenal. That batch was from growler. Trying again from can. Getting more pineapple, peach and white pepper. Still outstanding."
Amazing. No I mean it. I really enjoy this beer!
"This is the best beer that OH makes (that I've had to date). pours the murkiest golden yellow, beautiful head that retains and laces very well. smell is literally sticking your nose into a bag of new age hops: lots of citrus, lots of tropical fruit, lots of fresh cut grass, absolutely no malt scents on the nose. taste is the smell and then some: you don't truly understand how juicy this beer is until you have your first sip. big unsweetened orange juice notes with some tropical sweet fruits mixed in, the fresh cut grass note is a lot less apparent but still there, and it all finishes up with a big candied pineapple taste that lingers for minutes after a sip. feel was damn near perfect for a DDH beer: slick hop milk with plenty of carbonation to cut the thickness and advance the flavors. killer beer from OH, I wish I picked up more but my fridge is already capped."
"L - Hazy, opaque yellow, medium white head"
"Canned 3/9/17, it pours cloudy gold sandy color with a 2 finger foamy off white head that faded very slowly and left excellent lacing. Typical great looking DIPA from Other Half."
Canned 3/9/2017
Canned 12/29/16 (HOP). Enjoyed 2/15/17. Acquired in a trade.
"Grabbed this at the 12/31/16 release. Orange juice look. Great lacing and nose and the taste is delicious with the classic OH slight bite that I find fantastic. I've had regular Mylar and it is one of my favorites but this is just that much better. Let's put it this way...I have really good beers from Trillium, Treehouse, Hoof Hearted and The Veil in my fridge right now and this, along with DDH DMD are the ones I reach for!"
"Full can to myself. Super hazy and awesome. No bitterness at all, just straight juice. This is my favorite offering from Other Half, just slightly edging out DDH DMD."
"Consumed two weeks after release, poured into a Trillium tulip. Has a hazed orange color with one finger head and intense lacing. Soft, delicate tropical fruits hop out of the glass. Some hashish and potpourri underneath the copious fruit. Having had BUTS/Like Whoa/original Mylar Bags/etc, I can say this appears to be the juiciest DIPA I've come across from Other Half. Taste is full of hop oils, clementine, grapefruit, under-ripe pear, musky pine, dry as can be. Medium carb and mouthfeel. Look and nose are a bit deceiving but not in an unwelcome way. Overall a dope DDH offering from OH that is a solid improvement on the original. Shout out to my plug, thanks again Tony!"
"L: Hazy and cloudy OJ, apricot, and honey hues with a dense white head"
"I fell in love with the first batch of the non DDH version of this beer. While I thought this one had the same flavor with just a little more bitterness, the aroma of this beer is absolutely incredible. I didn't even want to drink it. Tastes like grapefruit+creamsicle and looks the same."
"L - Very light orange, bordering on a yellowish haze"
"This is a lot more interesting than regular Mylar Bags. A little on the sweet side, but thoroughly enjoyable. Pineapple juice galore, haziness and a nice dry finish. Super crushable."
"Juice bombs. Who doesn't love them? Hopheads would probably agree that they go down so easily while somehow satisfying the cravings for something full, boozy, and bitter at the same time. When the regular Mylar Bags came out a few months back, I got a growler of it from Other Half so I could enjoy it at home, not too long before the cans were released. Of course, neither lasted long and from the first whiff of this can, it was apparent that this would go pretty damn quick as well!"
"L - opaque, more yellow than orange, not much head"
"A - Iridescent bone-white foam leaps out of the glass. The body is a deep and juicy opaque pear, true to the New England style."
On sight the beer is straw colored . The nose is BIG LEAGUE mosaic. The mosaic just keeps coming and the taste is more of the same. This beer tastes like an earthy pineapple juice in the best way possible. There is much more flavor than regular Mylar Bags.
"Recently canned, and it feels even better than the one I had in the brewery on tap a couple of weeks ago. And it was the same batch. For some reason, I think individual cans are generally better than keg."
"DDH Double Mosaic Daydream has been on my wishlist for some time now - I was quite happy to try it when a fellow BA reached out to set up a trade. The cans were quite fresh - less than two weeks old - and the beer is tasting fantastic. Poured in to a teku, the color is a lovely golden orange with a thick white head. Carb is light and the mouth feel is very pleasant - just a bit creamy, quite rich, and the finish is decently clean. It's quite definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum, and once it warms up, and trace of bitterness virtually disappears."
"Pours a turbid orange creamsicle like with a thick white head on heavy pour. Nose is of a fresh cut fruit bouquet. Citrus and tropical fruits mingle in harmony with stone fruit ;) The taste of this thing is amazing! Papaya, mango, melon, peaches, guava, grapefruit and lemon. Did I miss any fruit? Almost has a orange creamsicle like quality to it minus the lactos or vanilla of course. Light breads malts balance this one out superbly. Medium to full body with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and smooth finish."
"Pours a murky orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, juicy hop notes, hitting orange, tangerine, papaya, mango, and pineapple. Biscuit and pale malts give it a little base, but overall the aroma is hops, hops, and hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, mango, pineapple, and tangerine. Big tropical fruit notes with solid pale and bread malts. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, lightly grainy texture that really makes this beer drink big. Overall, a heavy experience from this double dry hopped IPA. Tropical fruit notes are heavy and abundant, and yet well refined. "
"Fun to try another DDH offering from these guys; dig how the oat - per usual - imparts that superb mouthfeel on an already smooth, creamy, and flavorful beverage. A touch of grassy bitterness in back, too."
"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn. "
"16 oz can dated 8/8, about 2 weeks old"
Not as amazed as I’d hoped I’d be. The mosaic character in this is less noticeable than one might imagine for the DDH Etc. As always the OH mouthfeel being awesome but wanted some more punchy mango and pine in there
"Overall, just a great mosaic hopped beer. Loads of overripe mango and papaya from both the nose and taste. A touch of sweetness makes me think I’m drinking an alcoholic oranges/mango juice. These dream beers are super smooth and a joy to drink, although this one feels a tad thinner than the others I’ve had."
L - dense 2-finger head atop an opaque orange body.
"Naturally another beer fruit smoothie in that NEIPA style from Other Half, this one featuring Mosaic hops and lupulin powder, oats, and lactose - they call it an ""imperial oat cream IPA"" - Pale gold and totally opaque, looks like some kind of organic orange juice but with a frothy head... Lots of tropical and citrus notes on the nose are followed by creamy orange creamsicle pop meets marmalade meets a pineapple-mango smoothie... Soft and smooth, medium-light feel, plush-feeling goodness... No surprises here... 4/24/18 canning..."
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
Canned 4 days ago.
"This beer pours a completely opaque, super cloudy deep golden orange color with a two finger, creamy, soapy white head. Retention is excellent and there are lots of sudsy chunks of lacing left on the glass."
Canned a week ago.
"Pours a hazy, light orange coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smells intensely of tropical and citrus fruits: passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit. Smells just like fruit juice, really. Taste follows the nose, with and intensely hoppy taste of citrus and tropical fruit, with almost no malt coming through at all. Slightly dank and very juicy, the tropical and citrus fruit notes of passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine and grapefruit intermingle very harmoniously and are greatly balanced. There is a very slight, zesty tartness to this that turns into and equally light bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is absolutely sublime like I've never experienced: smooth, thick and effervesscent, almost fluffy. The mouthfeel is outstanding here, but otherwise this didn't blow away as much as I thought it would. It's great, of course, but really not that much better than NEIPAs I've had from Cloudwater, Lervig or Mikkeller. Looks like Other Half is just putting their pants on one leg at a time as well."
"L - holy crap, I'm starting to lose track of all these doubles, dreams, and mosaics. I was gifted this beer and thought, ""Damn already had this one."" Apparently not! Same exact thought process when I had DDH Double Mosaic Dream. Pours a soft, creamy orange that's easy on the eyes. The oats always give it that slightly pale banana cream yellowy look, which I'm a fan of."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass. 
"Given to me by a friend who got in a trade. Poured into a tulip, didn’t have a great head or smell but looks great. Tastes great. Feels great. Absolute hop bomb."
"On tap at Haymaker, NYC, pours cloudy beach water yellow gold color with a foamy 1 finger foamy white head that faded slowly and left rings and really nice spotty lacing."
"Drank from a 1 pt. (16 fl.oz.) can purchased at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
tall can
A: Beer pours a hazy off yellowish body with a creamy white head. The beer maintains a nice amount of head and lacing during the glass. 
Delivers on all cylinders.
"definitely getting the creamy aspect, there pithy grapefruit, creamy peaches, orange, a hint of blueberry and some green danky notes, hit of mellow bitterness on the finish. mango, mellow peppery and green herbaceous note. mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied and soft."
L - Dark yellow color with murky body and two fingers of white head.
Appearance: Pours cloudy and honey colored with a one finger head of foam; a few strands of lace with each sip
"My first Other Half does not dissapoint. Looks like apricot juice, good head, and a little lacing. Smell is immediately tropical fruit and citrus. Taste follows with big mango, pineapple, and candied citrus; finishes w just enough malt. Very smooth and absolutely delicious."
"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma is dank and hoppy with some chives and diesel notes. Taste starts on the sweet side, hoppy and dank, finishes with a medium to light bitterness."
"OH sweetness really takes over, big pineapple sugars and a frothy-cream mouthfeel. Lingering in the back of the swallow is a bit of heat but overall a good pour. It's a bit heavy and much but still a nice offering, would be happy to revisit this one again."
"This was yet another beer that I picked up at Other Half and took a while to having here at the house. After having 120 brews from them over the last few years, there was no doubt that this was in the upper echelon of what I've been able to sit down with, sip, and review on here. The look was typical of their other offerings but there was no doubt that the smooth taste and wondrous mouthfeel elevated this to another level; much to my delight!"
"This is easily my favorite Other Half beer, it has such a creamy mouthfeel and so much pineapple in the taste that it feels like you're drinking a lightly carbonated pineapple smoothie. This is absolutely delicious."
Pours orange juice orange with a small creamy head. Smells of tropical fruit. Taste is unbelievable. Nice dank tropical fruit taste. One of the best mouthfeels of any IPA out there. Dang this was a wonderful treat!!
This is a beast that I wasn't necessarily expecting to ever get a hold of.. but I'm so glad I did.
16 oz. can dated 08/10/17
"A: Burnt orange. Tennis court brown clay. Little more golden in the light, but this one's a bit darker than some other OH offerings. Full haze. Minimal head formation/retention."
"Beautiful mango juice color. Enticing mosaic aroma. Love mosaic hops! And this one nails all the characteristic aromas. Taste was a nice balance of the danky tropical, citrus of the mosaic and the bready sweetness due to the oats and lactose sugar. Mouthfeel was super creamy/pillowy. Along with DDH DMDream, this is a TOP-notch mosaic beer. They are my two favorite mosaics. Will search this out again!"
Shelton Brothers 8/18/17
The smell is a little funky but everything else is on point. I noticed these cans actually developed some improving flavor after 1 mo. Great beer!
My favorite other half. This beer is complex yet so drinkable. great IPa. has a citrus and creamy balance that makes it so unique. way better than six point sweet action
"L - beautiful hazy, almost opaque, straw color, but head dissipates quickly"
Such an amazing beer! Mouth drool!
L: Crisp golden and apricot hues with a generous white fluffy head
So here she is...the double dry hopped version of what I feel is other half's finest beverage to date. massive thanks to paulie for hooking it up!!!!
"Pours golden and hazy. Immediate fruity aroma fills the room. The beer starts as nice as it smells, but then ends a little empty and bitter. This is my favorite of the Hill Farmstead beers I've tried, but not my favorite beer. Still worth buying when it's available."
Thin feeling beer with very nice flavor. For me I get a lot of pine high is quite nice. Flavor is great for the thinness this beer has. Quality
"One of the prettiest beers I have seen in a while, this pours a hazy orange juice color with a nice two fingers of head. Head lasts a while before breaking leaving generous lacing. "
"drank from 12 oz can poured into tulip glass, a little over 4 weeks old--- no sign of weedy old hops, still very fresh tasting....delicious brew---nice balance of upfront fruitiness, pineapple mostly w a little grapefruit, followed by balancing mellow bitterness...Nice!"
"12/2013 - Big pineapple and orange nose, with some grapefruit lingering; large hop body with resinous notes dominating, and fruity grapefruit in the back; tangy bitterness on finish."
Serving: Can
"Almost fully opaque yellow-orange with a thick, convex white steamed milk-like froth settling in lumps with some spotty leopard lace."
A: Poured into a tulip glass to a hazy bright yellow topped by a finger of dense white head which retains well and leaves excellent lacing as it recedes
"Nice mild aroma, not overpowering. Slightly lemony, slightly stone fruit on the taste. Good offering from HF."
A: Pours a light orange-yellow with about 2 fingers of white head
Canned 3/12/18; drank 3/25/18 /2 the Yarchives. 
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a nice grapefruit citrus with a hind of hops. Taste is a very pleasant grapefruit citrus with hops that has a slight bitterness
"really smooth and juicy! great nose with just enough dank and plenty of orange/citrus.. a little pop of grapefruit on the tail end of the taste ... again everything is really balanced and nothing is overdone. not too heavy, but not thin on the mouthfeel either. this one is so damn drinkable"
"Got it fresh at Hill , excellent beer..... great taste very smooth ... sweet finish, touch of honey... cirrus overall slight bitter ...... will be having again"
"Pours an opaque pale orange in color with a finger+ of pillowy white head. Aroma is a bit on the muted side but I get pineapple, grapefruit, orange, and mango. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma; lots of smooth tropical fruits with a touch of citrus and pineapple sharpness, finish leans lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is perfectly pillowy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This is an excellent beer, it's near perfectly balanced and super drinkable. I wish I had grabbed more than one growler."
Tap at The Farmhouse Burlington.
"Tasted from draft. Pours a super cloudy pale orange with thick white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is big time tropical fruit. Notes of mango, passion fruit, pineapple and orange. Taste is incredibly well balanced. Mild to moderate bitterness with malt backbone. Really no bitter bite at all. I really think non IPA drinkers would love it. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with no hint of alcohol. Flavors of oranges, grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, pine, biscuit sweetness. Incredible IPA."
"On-draught @ Pony Bar, New York, NY. Currently #92 in the Top 250 beers list. Brief impressions below:"
"On tap at The Reservoir, Waterbury, VT. The appearance was a moderately hazy burnt orange color with a bar pour’s kind of slim looking film of a white head. Barely any lacing. The smell had a sweet pulpy grapefruit bursting over some bitter pine and subtle lemon rind. The taste takes the previously mentioned flavors and adds a nice drying effect on into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation seemed good with enough harsh bitterness on my tongue to definitely show some great DIPA effects. Overall, this was a very nice DIPA that I would have again."
I don't know what you could change to make this any better
"Not a total juice bomb like some other New England DIPAs, but a perfectly well balanced beer."
Outstanding.
"Look: Yellow, hazy with a fluffy head that sticks around for a while."

Lacks on the finish but otherwise a gem
"Again, from over the weekend..."
Tap pour into Tulip glass. Nice hazy honey look. Decent head with minimal retention but nice sticky foamy lacing all the way down. I had this after a #4 and it was a bit underwhelming after that. Nice dank tropical fruit aroma and nice understated flavor. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol was very well hidden. Delicious beer
Another solid brew from HF. No surprise
Hated straw golden with a dense bright white head - good retention and lacing. 
"Hill Farmstead has done it again. No bitterness, nice hoppiness. Amazing smooth fluffy cloud feel. The hops and fruitiness just go so well on the taste. So perfect."
"Pours an orange, hazed color with a decent, bubbly white head."
On tap at hill farmstead.
Nothing from HF will ever go below a 4.5. Bet that. Fantastic brewery
Poured from a growler into a tulip. Dank hops with somewhat off-putting hints of garlic/onion. Perfect carb and well-hidden alcohol presence. A solid offering.
Pours goldish orange. White head. Smells of grapefruit. Tastes like grapefruit. I was worried about some soapiness on the finish but the soapiness isn't too overbearing. It's a nice way to cut the fruit. The mouthfeel is soft as ever with a Hill DIPA. This is an excellent DIPA.
"From the growler filled on August 20, 2016. Sampled on August 25, 2016."
"It's true to style: hoppy, not bitter; background hop fruitiness. "
"From a growler filled a week ago. Pours cloudy orange-yellow, with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Aroma of citrus, not strong. Pleasant hoppy taste, lingers well. Feels very smooth and creamy. Very enjoyable."
"Drank on draft at Armsby Abby brunch today, 8/7/16, in a wine-like tulip glass; another great hoppy brew from Hill Farmstead, completely hidden ABV and very easy to drink"
"Amazing beer. Perfect mouthfeel. Not a lot of smell but tastes great some vanilla, earthy, just great. Liked it better than the double Galaxy. Complex profile. Poured from growler one week after visit. Get this one!"
"Growler filled on Saturday, opened last night..."
"Growler filled on Friday, opened Sunday."
"Pour: On draft at the Jeffery in NYC. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Very hazy and light straw in color. Medium white head. Aroma: Tropical fruit. Good hoppy citrus notes. Taste: Complex yet balanced. Immediately thought provoking on the first sip. First there is a very earthly quality which then reveals citrus, hops and pine flavors. Aftertaste: Hoppy citrus and pine recedes and finishes with earth and grass. Overall: Very interesting and complex brew. Really enjoyed it! Excellent. 4.68 out of 5."
Quite simply...best beer I have ever tasted. From a growler picked up at the brewery.
fresh growler drank from most recent release
Fresh from the brewery. Nice citrus nose. Lots of grapefruit notes and a strong hop presence with this one. Clean and crisp finish. Wish I was able to get more
Poured from a growler into a nonic pint glass.
"This is probably my favorite beer that I have had from Hill Farmstead. Nice and 2 finger head, with a gradient turbidity from yellow to orange. S&S#5 smells of strong citrus and tropic fruits. However, the taste is rather mild with some balanced acidic bitterness with balanced sweetness and full smooth mouthfeel. The bitterness remains in the middle notes but completely drops off at the end for a clean finish.The overall notion of this imperial IPA is utter drinkability as its stability between bitter and sweet is completely in tact."
Excellent DIPA. Aroma of tangerine. Smooth mouthfeel. Easy to drink.
Favorite Hill Farmstead beer to date.
"A deep straw pour with a thin head but nice lacing. A sweet hop scent leads to a balanced citrus and grapefruit taste. Mild bitterness. The alcohol is well masked, nombooziness. Solid."
very smooth and refined offering from HF.. pours the classic HF straw yellow hazy.. smells of citrus rind fruits.. so smooth to taste.. taste follows the nose.. mouthfeel is great.. awesome stuff from HF
"Glowing yellow color with a tremendous amount of haze to it. Is this a wheat beer? Looks like it. Solid white head almost 1/3"". Tons of tropical fruit and grapefruit on the nose. Super dank and impressive."
"Poured from a month old growler that a friend picked up at the brewery. Light golden, hay colored DIPA. Great hop aroma with a little more bitterness than expected. This may have sat a little too long, but was still very good"
"I love everything about this beer. Cloudy and hazy, beautifully unfiltered, with a super tropical nose. The taste is fantastic. Juicy tangerine, mango, slight passionfruit and grapefruit, and pine on the back really showcase the variety of hops in here. Nice creamy like mouthfeel as well. Perfect balance between American and NZ hops."
"On draft into tulip. Bright peach tangerine orange, hazy, phenomenal lacing. This beer is excellent. Their house yeast makes their beers so special, and it comes out strong here. You get some nice bitterness from the hops, along with tropical fruits, kiwi, some grapefruit. Mouthfeel is great too, slight tartness on the finish."
"2L growler filled 10/29/15. I'm settling in to drink it all by myself so if I don't post again, send someone over to check on me. Poured into a 12oz tulip, a gloriously murky pear colored brew with a big sloppy head that fades down to leave great gobs of lacing on the glass. The smell is of a load of tropical fruits spread out on a slab of white bread. Sharp and clean. Taste: 'Think grapefruit' nails it. Beautifully bitter from first impact right through to the lingering aftertaste. Dank, with citrus notes dominating, vanilla bread-iness and mineral astringency. Feel: Medium body, clean and smooth, slight fizzy carbonation ideally complements the sharpness. O: Not a super-complicated brew but who needs complicated? And who could be happier than me? I could have gotten a 750 but I got the 2L instead - absolutely-freaking-outstandingly-good beer coupled with good decision making on my part."
Growler poured into a snifter.
"Had poured from a 750ml growler, 7 days old, into a small tulip glass. Nice citrus smell and taste and a pale yellow color with off white and golden accents. Excellent beer that I would go back for again and again."
Another amazing offering by Hill Farmstead! Have heard great things about S&S #5 and this one didnt let me down!!! Enjoyed with friends from a 750ml growler. Nice citrus notes and smooth finish but tons of hops character!
"So I'm at the only brew house in my area that gets Hill Farmstead. They always have something from HF on tap. I walk in and just ask for HF without even looking at what it was because I haven't had anything that wasn't excellent from HF. I hear some moaning going on at the other end of the bar and I find out I got the last pour. The keg kicked. First thing I think is damn - this is a great brew but I'm only gonna get one. But then the manager says "" no worries - we always have another ready to go "" well now were talking. They wipe the board and write in "" Society & Solitude #5. I had #4 while in VT so I was pumped and it didn't let me down in the least. Another home run from HF. Wonderful flavor that was deep and went on forever. Great mouth feel. Light for a DIPA and very fruity. Just wonderful. I wish more spots would get brews from HF as the one is 40 minutes from me but hell - its worth the ride."
"Poured from 750ml growler into teku glass. Pours a lovely, hazy orange color. Nose is pure tropical fruit and the taste follows suit. One finger head that laces well. Very smooth despite the relatively high potency here. A delicious beer for sure."
While head. Golden orange color.
Reminded me of Sip of Sunshine and Tribute. Pure excellence.
"Drank from a 750 ml (25.36 fl.oz.) growler purchased at Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro Bend, VT"
"Instead if breaking it down piece by piece...I'll simply say this is Hill Farmstead all the way. Fresh, clean and bit too boozy got a DIPA. One of their best"
On tap @ Monk's Café in Philly
L- golden and hazy
L: Hazy color that has a lingering hop dust look
I prefer s and s #4 but this is world class as well. Beer and brewery speak for themselves. Best
L: One of the most perfect looking DIPA I've ever seen. The body is a glowing and hazy orange. The head is fluffy and white with nice lacing as the beer recedes.
"Pours a lighter hazy orange, good inch tall thick white head. "
"Pours pale hazy golden straw, On the light side for double IPA."
"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. As a confessed un-fan of IPA's it's with great trepidation that those who know me suggest anything in the genre. "
Poured fom tap at TJs in Paoli into a snifter glass in August 2015.
"8-25-2015 - On tap at TRIA in Philadelphia. Poured into a stemmed tulip glass. Nice bite and hop forward. Not too boozy, so I had a second. Good to have HF on tap in Philly."
Another 750 ml growler into a tulip. Should be special.
"Pours a partially hazy orange that borders on burnt but isn't all too dark. Nose is composed of mostly light malts with little citrus to back it up. Taste is again centered around the malt profile which is bordering on pale ale and saison without the yeast character. Again not as big as a hop presence as I was expecting particularly with some new zealand varietals that often weigh down the dank. Blindfolded I would've never guessed DIPA, this thing is dangerously crushable and the alcohol is catching up to me pretty quick. Decent, not a great representation of the style nor the hype that surrounds what these guys are capable of producing."
Poured from three day old growler
"Pours a dull, hazy orange with a half inch, bright white head embedded with tiny ringlets. Nose is fairly subdued - notes of citrus fruit and rind. Taste expresses candied citrus and a light medicinal bitterness towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a light acidity and a mild carbonation. Overall, a decent brew but there are better examples of the style."

Very nice look and smell. The feel was especially impressive here. My only gripe is that this seems boozy as hell. It's unfortunate as it is otherwise wonderful.
Thank you Knapp85 for this growler.
"Think grapefruit, it says. So I did, and they're correct. Very much a fruity punch of grapefruit in the face. An enjoyable DIPA, with an above-average mouthfeel: smooth and creamy. Hill Farmstead just does it right. That's what they do."
I wasn't a fan of this beer. I taste a lot of caramel and grapefruit but to me this was far too sweet- almost cloyingly sweet. To me this doesn't have the usual hill farmstead feel to it.
"Poured from a growler into a pilsner glass, the beer is a hazy, yellow-gold coloring with a foamy, clingy, bright white head. Aromas of lemon, subtle pepper spice, cut grass, subtle piney notes, and a bready backbone. Highlights of tangerine and basil. Very balanced aromas. The flavors are an amazingly balanced blend of lemon, candi sugar, cut grass, pine tassels, and a bready backbone. Highlights of tangerine, basil, and hints of pepper. Extremely balanced on a smooth, robust body. Amazingly balanced, even into the peppery and citrus sweet aftertaste. The finish is smooth, soft, and quickly dry at the end. Very well balanced, amazingly crafted beer!"
"Rich, tasty, enjoyable. Grapefruit flavor is very light - not overpowering like others. Nice brew!"
Poured on tap at Three Penny Tap Room into a tulip glass.

"i havent had a ton of the wild or dark stuff from hill farmstead, and i know its all been really well received, but for me, its the hoppy stuff that makes them stand apart, and this series, and this beer in particular, are what thats all about. the more i drink these beers this week, the more i think they all kind of look the same, very hazy yellow, pale straw colored without visible sediment and tall frothy white heads that leave all kinds of intricate lacing on the edges of the glass. as many as ten of their hoppy beers look like this, and this iteration does as well. its the nose and taste that make this one stand out from the others, you really get the new zealand hops there, but unlike some of the others they do with these hops, this one actually brings the bitterness in the finish. i suppose it is a grapefruit peel sort of bitterness, not a generic hop intensity, but its much more bitter than a lot of their other ones. the oily resiny part comes way sooner, really early actually compared to the field, about the middle of the beer. its juicy and ripe and very much alive, but it doesnt taste like other ipa. there must be some wheat and even oats in here fluffing up the body and rounding the edges, there is nothing harsh about this, including its abv, which should really come through a lot more than it does. i am just so impressed with the composition of this beer on the whole, awesomely fresh from the tap, and frankly one i should have slowed down and savored a little more, its just so easy to drink beer this good. i would really love to try the other beers in this series, but this one sure is a winner. not to be passed up if you are lucky enough to come across it."
"On tap. I have had one Society & Socitude before, the fourth iteration. Loved it. This one has New Zealand hops; love those, too. Poured a cloudy orange color. Aroma is a blast of fruity hops. A damn blast. Tangerine and grapefruit and other puréed fruits. Hops just flexing about with no regard for human souls. Doesn't necessarily remind me of New Zealand hops but I don't mind, it smells delectable. Flavor is very proud and strong. Pure hop immulsion. Hops are of orange, tangerine, lemon, pineapple and guava. So strong but still so smooth. Bitter but not an enamel stripper. I always love heading to VT in the Summer and gorging myself on their delicious liquid gifts. I had Society & Solitude 4 several years prior to this but I remember loving it and I feel the same about this one as well."
Best beer I've ever had period. All Hill Farmstead beers are near perfect but this one elevates itself above their other offerings. If I could rate higher than 5 for all 5 categories I would.
"It has that east coast look to it. Very cloudy, pale orange color with a bright white puffy head. The cap is not as big on mine as some of the other descriptions I have read, and disappears very quickly. I did open it a day past their best by date though. "
Sha-Bam!! Much better than Susan which I am nuts about. The depth of hops in the middle has me mesmerized. Growler fills 6/13/15
"Growler from the brewery. Pours cloudy yellow with a big creamy white head that just sticks all over the glass. Aroma of grapefruits, pineapples, mangoes, some pine and grass, really nice. Flavor is off the hook. Lots of bitterness here, but it gets your palate ready for the sweet pineapple and mango, along with lots of citrus fruits, and then a final kick of bitter dry pine. Finishes clean as can be (no surprise there for HF). Body is relatively light for a DIPA, but creamy with nice sweet malt backing. Goes down way too easy. This is fantastic."
"L: hazy tangerine with a bone head. S: bitter orange, tropical fruit, a fleeting hint of anise seed. F: bitter orange, tropical fruit, a bit of pine and minerals. Juicy but with a clean finish."
Thanks to TheSevenDuffs for sending a growler out my way
"Thanks to @Evilash for muling this for me from HF. Poured from a HF 750ml growler into a HF stem glass. My wife shared a small glass of it with me. Like the other HF pale ales/IPAs I've been lucky enough to try, what sets this apart is the incredibly clean finish. It's hoppy and juicy, but the finish is so amazingly clean. It's a marvel how they are able to do that with their pales. Bitterness and fruit from the hops come forward in the flavor. An outstanding offering, one that is right up there with the best IPAs I've had."
"Growler, pour is golden with medium head. Aroma is big tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. Taste is fruity and bitter with a smooth finish, a touch of alcohol"
Poured from a fresh growler.
"Tag says best consumed before April 15, 2015."
I think grapefruit when tasting this.
"One smell, one sip, one taste...you know your playing with the big boys now. Only a select few can touch this on the East Coast."
Scary easy to drink. Grapefruit all the way. Great balance between sweetness and bitterness.
Had this beer fresh and was amazing
Poured from a 750ml HF growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Purchased at the brewery. 
"Pours a cloudy golden straw color with a hazy body and a thin white head. Smell is highly citric. Grapefruit and mango seem to lead the way. Taste is grapefruit up front that turns to bready malt mid-palette. The finish is a little resinous with a medium bitterness. Fairly light bodied for a DIPA. Soft mouthfeel, almost creamy. "
"A-hazy golden color with hints of orange, nice white head with good lacing"
"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled about 9 hours ago"
Poured from a fresh growler into a modified tulip glass.
My name and devotion say it all; catching up on previous tasting.
"Growler, thanks to Colin. Cloudy orangish/yellow pour. White head. Pleasant grapefruit hop aromas. Great mouthfeel. Smooth grapefruit and citrus/orange peel hops blend seamlessly with the caramel malt notes. Really solid with a good body and great balance."
Growler into a tasting glass.
750ml growler filled about 2 weeks ago. Tulip glass.
Juicy and amazing. One of the best.
From a bottle had at the brewery last week.
"Just drank some moments ago and love it, amazing IIPA... Highly recommended!"
"Heavy orange peel and orange juice in the aroma. Fresh hop sensation throughout the taste, heavy grapefruit bitterness, ending with pine that lingers. I cant say enough about the taste of this beer, it is the most perfect example of an IPA I have come across."
"Peach juice, splash of mango. A little pineapple on the nose. Delicious."
The beer comes in a hazy bright golden color.
Growler filled 8/8/14 and poured next day into Belgian ale glass.
"Poured from a 22. Extremely bright yellow (2-3 SRM), hazy. Well but not overly carbonated. Reeks of tropical fruits and pungent hops. Tastes like a funky hop/pineapple creamsicle. Mouthfeel is unbelievably dense and chewy despite it's extreme drinkability. Hops linger on the tongue for what seems like forever. Wow! This might be the best DIPA I've ever had. Highly recommended."
"Thank you Slatetank for sharing the spoils of your recent VT trip with me. Poured into a snifter, the brew appears a clouded pale yellow color with a firm white topping that persists. The brew plays the part well visually as expected."
Enjoyed at HF 4th Anniversary Party
Good stuff. 
"Growler shared with stillmatic2232, thanks man!"
This poured with a cloudy and dull yellow appearance but settled into a golden hue. The head had immense foam that was thick with great retention.
"I had this from the 750ml growler courtesy of tenderbranson69, enjoyed chilled in a willybecker."
Poured from a 750 mL growler into a snifter. This was filled at the brewery 6 days before drinking.
750ml growler. Thanks Anthony. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass on 5/20/2014.
"Poured from a 750mL growler into a Spencer goblet. Filled 5/16, consumed 5/18."
"Thanks to tderoeck! Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a tight white cap. The smell is grapefruit and tropical fruit. The taste is red on grapefruit initially with some softer tropical fruit notes coming in later with a touch of honey sweetness, ending dry and somewhat bitter. On the light side of medium with the typical Hill Farmstead wonderfully fine, elegant carbonation. Great stuff!"
"Pours a hazy bright yellow/gold. Small bubbly head. Great looking ipa. The aroma on this is just great. Super tropical and juicy. Couldn't ask for much more in the aroma. The taste is slightly sweet upfront. Really fruity with only a bit of bitterness on the end. Pineapple, mango, orange, lemon, pine. Really great Balance of flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on, too. Medium with a nice amount of carbonation. Coats the tongue with hoppy goodness and is slightly sticky. Maybe even better than what I remember having back around thanksgiving. So drinkable with a ton of flavor."
"Pours hazy and like grapefruit juice. Yellow and with a thin white head of foam that fell pretty fast. Leaves some lace. Nose is citrus! Orange, grapefruit and a little sweet grass. The malt peeks it's head out with a touch of sweetness on the nose. It drinks lovely. Not a hint of alcohol on the palate. Just beautiful citrus. sweet orange, sweet earth, a touch fo grapefruit and some grass. Finishes with a perfect bitter that does not reside too long and that reminds you to take one last notice of all that fruit. Malt is a bit of weight on the palate but has a sweetness that seems to come out of no where and so delicately. Drinks clear and fruity and finishes dry but with a bit of tartness to keep your mouth watering long into the finish."
Just picked up yesterday at the brewery.
"Pour is hazed golden yellow with an off white head. Nose is juicy, tropical fruit and citrus, a hint resiny and oily in back. Light grain profile up front and some malt sweetness to balance. Taste has more bitterness than I thought it would, lighter body and softer carbonation. The grain is soft up front, hop driven. Citrus, pine fades to a more leafy herbal note, a strong grapefruit bitterness lingers with a fairly dry finish."
"Served on-tap at the Prohibition Pig on 12/27/13, served in a tulip. Reviewed from notes. "
From Notes:
Tasted on 1/4/14
A-Hazy and cloudy bright orange that leaves nice lacing.
Poured into a Dogfish Head Spiegelau IPA glass.
"My first venture into HIll Farmstead IPA's. Was very excited to get a shot at this, received in a grunt, tagged as best by today's date the 19th. "
"One of the ones I missed out on before, now get another chance at trying it thanks to rudzud for splitting again."
"A-cloudy orange yellow that pours a thin white head, that dissipates to a ring with some lacing"
Split with JLindros.
750ml growler reviewed a week ago or so live. Split with friends Kathy and Chris.
"750ml growler split between me and Kevin, filled at the brewery earlier that day."
"Pours vibrant, cloudy orange, white head rests like a creamy pillow on the surface, sticky lacing left behind. Aroma is juicy grapefruit and pineapple, mango, orange essence, with earthy, lightly spiced pine, dusty pale malts behind. Taste is more grapefruit-centric with hefty citrus, still a bit of pineapple flesh, caramel sweetness blended in and offset by rich piney bitterness. Medium body, very easy to drink with bright well-balanced flavors and no sticky resin character."
750ml Growler
Poured from a 750ml Hill Farmstead growler into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.
"Poured out as a nice golden color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is bright with citrusy hops. The taste of the beer has a nice citrus fruitiness to it. The feel of the beer is smooth, light bodied, very nice. Overall it's a very good IPA."
Big thanks to Bilco for the growler.
"Look is a dark and cloudy honey orange color that just radiates in the sunlight- fantastic. Smell is distinctly citrussy tropical with grapefruit, tangerine and mango coming to mind. I can pick up on a minimal amount of malty sweetness with few piney notes. Juicy citrus and tropical grapefruit, tangerine and mango explode on the pallet and remind me of what I think an ideal juicy citrus hop profile should taste like. Bitter pine is not up front for me, but does come through in the finish. I don't pick up on much malt here, but its just enough in the background to complement the hops yet not overwhelm or take anything away. I would say the finish holds a very mild bitterness to it that is somewhat toned by a creamy malt. Great creamy mouth feel that I have come to expect from HF- very drinkable. Overall its hard to beat this brew and I can personally think of very few that come close to the hop flavor profile! No question in my top 5 DIPA"
750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
"A - Golden Brown, Hazy, head straight to the top of glass, thick lasting lacing, lots of carbonation rising"
"Served from a 750ml Growler into my HF Tulip, #properglassware bitches."
"750mL flip-top growler thanks to jbeatty. 2-Day air mailed to me. Poured full haze glowing orange with rich, bright white foam. Good lacing. Nose is whipped cream, butterscotch, jackfruit, mango, and typical Nelson squashiness. Taste is richer than expected with whipped cream and heavy biscuit. Flashes of sugar and alcohol. Thick, dessert like finish. Saltwater, buoyant palate with a finale of grapefruit rind. Awesome, but not as bright and refreshing as the passionfruit forward S&S#6."
"Bottled into 750ml swing-top growler on July 26, 2013. Poured into a large tulip and paired with salmon."
Happy IPA day! I just got this in the mail today so I figured it would be a great time to drink up.
"Can't ask for anything better in this beer. Perfect balance of hops, malt backbone and a grapefruity twang"
750mL growler split into tulip. 
Served in a straight sided glass at the Mad Taco.
Big thanks to cfrancess33 for getting the growler to our tasting. 750 ml growler served in a HF wine glass.

"Swing top 750 ml growler filled yesterday, poured into a port glass. Classic cloudy yellow orange, unfiltered beauty,2 finger dense bone white head,carbonation difficult to see but spot on, tons of sticky lacing left behind."
On-tap at 2012 Hill Farmstead Harvest Fest.
"Reviewing the Society & Solitude #5 from the Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro Bend, Vermont."
"Revisiting, last time I remember having thisnis at 3rd Anniversary and I do not remember the beer's depth of flavor. This is a fizzy like peppery flavor to the hop profile. So nice and different. Really enjoying it, more than the 4.5 from years back."
"Looked like an extremely cloudy, vibrant color yellow, not dissimilar to many American wheats or hefeweizens. White head, looked distinct and respectable. Aroma was out of this world, heavenly luscious tropical fruit aromas, this is the creme de la creme of new proprietary hop aromas coming out, this ain't your daddies C hop bomb (nothing wrong with that though)."
"On-tap at the Blackback Pub in Waterbury, served in a HF goblet. One of many. :)"
This is my favorite beer of all time.
"Thanks to Moll for grabbing the growler for me. Served in Hill Farmstead stemware. Nose has loads of grapefruit and accompanying peel. Very dry. Fairly bitter, but not super over the top. Pretty light body. Another huge winner from Hill Farmstead. I am not surprised."
"Thank's so much to the awesome franklinn for this, along with many other VT treats. I should note that sadly, this growler is almost 4 weeks old. I just couldn't pick it up until now. It's almost completely filled to the top and has been kept very cold until now, when I poured it into my Bruery tulip."
Growler to worthy sniffer
Poured from a growler into a stone snifter. It poured a hazy light golden color with a thick foamy white head. Great lacing as I drank it. 
Notes taken from 9/29 from the craziest bottle share that i have ever been a part of. Thanks so much to the NYC and Hoboken crew for letting me participate in this incredible day of drinking long time wants and insanity.
A: Poured a cloudy golden orange color with good carbonation leaving a small fluffy white cap which resedes after a few sips revealing layers of white rings clinging to the edge of the glass.
Thanks to baconsausage for the Hill Farmstead box. My first HF beer! 750mL swingtop growler poured into my new HF stemware.
Presentation: 2L growler filled at the brewery and sampled a little later. Kept chilled since it was filled and poured into a pint glass.

10/13/2012
"On tap. Very hazy gold pour, almost white, white head. Aroma is really quite fruity and pungent, lots of grapefruit, the hops are wet and sticky. Taste is fruity, not particularly bitter, very grapefruity - bitter and citrusy tart at once. Alcohol is not perceptible. Palate is lightly-med carbed with med body. Not my favourite from HF but definitly very good"
First had: on tap at Hill Farmstead
2L growler from Jim (jale). Thanks a ton dude! Served in a Kuhnhenn tulip.
"Growler to HF Stemmed tulip. Growler filled on Sept 22, consumed on October 5th. "
"Growler sent kindly by millerbuffoon, thanks a lot!"

Thanks to Mac & Justin for sharing!
64oz growler (Harvest Fest)
Tasted from a growler 24 hours after the 2012 Hill Farmstead Harvestfest.
Decided to crack open a 2 liter growler of society of solitude 5 that I picked from hill farmstead at the 2012 harvest fest. I really enjoyed trying this brew at the festival so my mouth is watering to tap into this growler
"The beer is hazy golden yellow with a white head. Citrus and hops, grapefruit, orange, rind. Smells fabulous. Smooth and delicious. Lingering hops with a delectable bitterness. Little malt profile. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Another winner from Shaun and the folks at Hill Farmstead."
A - Light golden yellow with a finger of a white head. Leaves decent lacing. Nice and hazy.
"Growler thanks to juliusseizure. Filled 9/22/12, enjoyed 9/26/12. Poured into a Hill Farmstead tulip."
Poured into Jack's Abby pint
On-tap at Parker Pie and HF Harvest Fest 2012 into HF wine glass and pint glass (at Parker Pie).
"Poured from tap at the 2012 Harvest Festival - twice. Pours a beautiful hazy straw color with nice head. Aromas are just amazing. Big citrus/grapefruit hops! Taste is deff full of the grapefruit, but sweet hops and malts really balance the bitterness. Its just so drinkable and bursting with flavors. One of the best Double IPA's out there. Have this brew if you can get your hands on it!"
"Served on-tap, reviewed from notes."
"Sampled on draft a few times during the Harvest Festival weekend, and a few glasses from a growler watching football on Sunday."
Picked this up at the Hill Farmstead Autumn Harvest Festival in a 750ml bottle. I honestly had not sampled the previous four in this series so I was not sure what to expect.
"Opaque orange juice yellow-orange with a tall, slow to recede off white foam settling to a root beer float island leaving tons of lacing. "
L - pours a glowing early sunset yellow. Mild haze with a floofy head. 
"Canned 10/15, so one week ago. "
"Definitely the most unique presentation of Nelson I’ve had... comes through more citrus than white wine, with exceptional balance and perfect mouthfeel."
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a strong grapefruit and hops. Taste is also a strong combination of grapefruit and hops that is slightly bitter.
"07/2017 - I've never experienced a beer so full of Nelson and enjoyed it so much! In fact, it's a tour de force of Nelson; creamy, juicy, tiny amount of vanilla; flavorful as all hell!"
This New Zealand hop is perfect. Love HF
"The cleanest beer out of Hill Farmstead's ""Double"" offerings. While I prefer the juiciness of Double Galaxy more, the Nelson hops make this a bit smoother while still maintaining the fruitiness. It gets straight 4.5 across the board: the haziness shows off this traditional NE (D)IPA, and the beer has that traditional HF farmhouse smell. As aforementioned, the juiciness is great here, with notes of grapefruit and the it goes down very smooth for a DIPA. For me, smoother than Galaxy, but not as much as Citra and juicier than Citra, but not as much as Galaxy."
A: Hazy orange bodied beer. Looks similar to orange juice. Lots of lacing left behind. Poured a solid 2 finger head out of the can. 
Pours a solid murky straw color with a tinge of green. Strong white head. Strong smell of grapefruit and sweet pineapple. I'm immediately impressed. Taste is very tropical. There is a forward sweetness of juicy mango and pineapple that settles down to bitter grapefruit. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation and slickness. This one is amazing and I see why nelson hops are popular.
Can from Eric
"Pours a super hazy pale straw-light orange in color with nearly two fingers of dense white head. Aroma is white grape, a touch of candied pineapple, and some grapefruit. Taste is very tropical and smooth; pineapple, mango, some grapefruit, and only a touch of white grape. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. I found this to. E greater than the sum of its parts and it became more enjoyable Over the course of the growler."
"Got this last week in a trade. I knew it would be great but it is definitely a ""wow"" beer. Hill Farmstead is absolutely the best at what they do and this proves it further!"
12 oz can poured into a tulip. Grapefruit forward balanced nicely with some hop bitterness on the backend. A touch below Double Galaxy and Double Citra but worth searching out.
6-pack of cans from the brewery. Kinda like Tree House Green. Very smooth for 8%.
Poured from a 750mL growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed wine. Thanks Ryan for the share. 
Pours a pale orange with thin head and great lacing. 
"Best Nelson beer I have had, by far! Solid-looking orange juice color. Very weird and interesting on the aroma for a nelson beer. Smelled danky pineapple right off the bat, and a few minutes after that the usual gooseberry, kiwi, white wine stuff. Nice oaty breadiness as well. Flavor followed the nose with the oatiness and gooseberry being the frontrunners. And of course the usual HF smoothness on the mouthfeel. Took a while to nab this one, but it was worth it and I will be looking to grab some more!"
"Pours hazy yellow/orange with off white fluffy head. Aroma is subtle white wine notes, some earthiness too. Flavor is amazing...white wine, juicy, earthiness and lingering bitterness. Feel is spot on. Not heavy...very approachable and easy to drink. Finishes very dry. Overall this is another HF winner. Everything they make is world class!"
"750ml growler, freshly filled, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 3.21.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
I think Nelson might be my new favorite hop due to the fact that the majority of IPA's I've enjoyed most have nelson or are all nelson hops!
"Great refreshing beer, good flavors, but nothing explosive, it's a nice easy drinker from HF. That said, there was almost no aroma to it, my sniffer may be off, but I got almost nothing. Loved the taste and feel of this beer, supper glad that I got to try it!"
Nelson hops are one of my favorite varieties! Drank Double Nelson out of a 750 growler filled by a friend and it was magnificent! Absolutely will track down again!
750ml flip top growler filled at the brewery. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. 
"The appearance was hazy burnt yellow color with a lasting finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Some light stringy lace. The aroma had a majestic blend of lemon pulp sweet to bitterness, some pine, zesty to resinous behavior from the hops, sweet grass and a little bit of sweet wood. The flavor blended everything so fully bittersweet to guide fully on into the aftertaste and finish wonderfully. The palate was medium bodied and had a fantastic sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt spot on and the ABV felt just as projected by the brewer. Overall, always a real treat to have some Hill Farmstead in my life."
Growler poured into a Teku at the Nebraska Whale Slayer Ball ii.
For my taste this offering is next in line to Abner. A nice knock of citrus on the nose and palate but with a little more bite than Abner. Simply spectacular and I'm sad this is my last 750 ml.
fresh growler drank on 4/14/2017
"From a growler filled at the brewery on April 1. Nelson isn't my favorite hop, but I do like it and this is probably the best Nelson beer I have had. It has all of the typical HF double IPA characteristics - hazy golden color, fluffy white head, an almost creamy texture, and a perfect showcase of the hop varietal. Wow."
"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 750 ml swing top growler into signature tulip glass, best before 3/25/2017. Pours very hazy golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit, mango, melon, guava, peach, apricot, berries, white grape, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus/earthy hops and moderate bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit, mango, melon, guava, peach, apricot, berries, white grape, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, cracker, bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine/herbal/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit, mango, melon, guava, peach, apricot, berries, white grape, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Slight dryness from lingering bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and lightly silky/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is an insane DIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, thanks to the smooth/mellow bitterness. Super dank, juicy, and vibrant on hop flavors; great malt balance without feeling sweet or heavy for the ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering."
"Pineapple, kind of has that sticky Hill Farmstead frothy thing going on which I dig. Tropical smell and fluffy and sweet on the palate."
L: Light honeycomb and apricot hues with a healthy white head
"On-tap at Blackback, Waterbury, VT."
"Pours a hazy (opaque, even) pulpy orange, topped by a sizeable snow-white head. Great retention, and fantastic lacing."
Pours an orangish yellow color with a nice foamy 1 inch head. Smells like mango and peach and grapes. Nice alcohol taste with the citrus flavor of the hops bursting thru and great bitterness. Wonderful mouthfeel.
"Not as good as Nelson Single Hop by Hill Farmstead. Similar characteristics in appearance and aroma. Flavor is a bit sweeter but a punch too strong on the heat from the alcohol. Overall, a nice offering, but not the best from the HF lineup."
"Melons on melons. Hint of alcohol on the finish. Superb. Crisp finish. Light body. Some green grape, kiwi, honeydew, and loads of cantaloupe/muskmelon. Top notch DIPA"
"750 mL growler. Very hazy orange. Big white head. Intense Nelson aroma. Orange, grape, melon, and some resin. Tastes equally intense. Pithy orange with a strong grape flavor. Herbal like it’s going to be grassy, but never quite gets there. Hefty bitterness. I barely notice how sweet it is until I think about it. Tropical fruit sweetness peaks in the very back end. Medium heavy. This is stunningly good."
Good golly Miss Molly!
Poured from a recent growler into a large tulip glass.
"Bright golden yellow pour with a sticky dense foamy head that leaves pock holey sheets of lace on the glass. Citrus aroma blasts from the pour through the last sip ... never dies out. The flavor is big grapefruit and mango, and the mouthfeel is coolwhip smooth."
Growler shared by yourefragile. Thanks Michael. 
"Growler purchased from Hill Farmstead in Greensboro Bend, VT."
750ml growler poured into a Kane snifter.
"great looking beer - hazy golden yellow with a super dense and creamy white head that leaves sick lacing. somewhat mild aromas are matched nicely on palate. notes of white grape, orange peel, grapefruit, herbaceous mintyness, green tea, grass, hint of peach, earthy pine, dankness. has that signature HF texture, medium-full bodied, extremely soft, mega fluff. overall a wonderful IIPA."
"On tap. Vibrant yellow haze with a small to medium white head. Beautiful. Grapefruit, bit of orange, nice grape skin aroma. Flavor follows with vibrant nelson sauvin hop notes. Finished soft and leaves your palate quickly. Awesome beer."
One of the best beers I have ever had!
"Pours a straw like yellow color with a slight white head that dissipated quickly. On the nose, smells of white wine, grapefruit, and a slight hint of oranges. Tastes great! It has that raw hop taste I have come to enjoy from super fresh IPA's. Sweet fruits, white wine and grapefruit come through beautifully. A soft mouthfeel with a nice amount of carbonation. Overall a great beer. "
On tap on Big Fatty's BBQ in white river junction. Served in a fluted snifter.
Excellent IPA full of hop juiciness. Citra stand out enhanced with a very slight dryness/tartness likely from the drier Nelson. Subtle malt notes adding some biscuit and thread of caramel. Poured a beautiful merangue like head; stiff with soft peaks with great lacing. Pale soft slightly hazy orange. So remarkably smooth going down. Gentle and foamy on the tongue. A rather unique interesting IPA with its many subtle integrated complexities in an otherwise big Hop juicy brew. Would love try this one again...and again. Outstanding.
"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned 9/11/18, code WHEN YOU SMILE THE SUN IT PEAKS THROUGH THE CLOUDS."
"Can dated 9/11 from Sean (thanks!), so just over 3 weeks old. "
"Poured into a snifter. A bright yellow haze with a thick and resilient white head. Great lacing in the glass. White grape and tropical fruit aroma with a touch of resin. The taste followed with Nelson leading the charge. White wine flavor, dank resin, and tangerine on the finish. Pillowy soft feel. Outstanding."
"08/2015 - This is hella dope; so much orange, peach, and citrus hops on the nose; plus, sweet, juicy, cream flavors on the palate; just incredible. Yum!"
Straight from the can via purchase at TH 9/20/2018
"A: hazy matte orange color with some yellow and light amber notes. Super hazy. Frothy, 2-3 finger off-white head"
Canned 10 days ago.
"16oz can, dated 9.11.18, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. "
16 oz. can dated 9/11/18
"Picked-up twelve cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton yesterday for four dollars and five cents per can. This is my 16th brew from these guys. This is a big miss for me, very bland."
This beer is good but I was disappointed. I really want to like treehouse and they are good but not a 4.5 beer
"I think this is as good, if not better than the more celebrated IPAs from Tree House. More like beer than the typical ""lemonade"" character of the other TH IPAs."
TREE HOUSE IN PERPETUITY DIPA 8/23/18
"Not quite the haze bomb I've come to expect of Tree House beers - In Perpetuity is a slightly thinner beer, featuring an outstanding juicy, clean, light nose. The taste and feel are just a bit thinner than I'd hoped, but matches expectation based on appearance. The taste is still outstanding, with only light bitterness. It's a very fresh, sessionable beer (at least in taste and mouthfeel - perhaps not in ABV)."
"Pours an opaque hazy yellow as to be expected. Good head with significant legs. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops with a slight graininess. Taste follows suit, mango notes with a somewhat dank hoppiness, very soft mouthfeel. I liked the beer but it's nothing I would seek out - this one was given to me by my generous neighbor. Doesn't satisfy my desire for a good IPA, too soft and too citrusy."
"This is probably the best IPA I've ever had. To me it checks all the boxes as far as a New England IPA goes. The nose is beautiful,fragrant citrus swirl. The taste and mouthfeel that Tree House produce in this style of beer is both unique and unequaled by any other brewery. To top it all off, Jerry Garcia's lyrics on the bottom of the can on the June 19th canning. I should have bought a case."
"This is the hidden gem in the well-regarded lineup of Tree House beers. I've had this from 3 different canning runs in Charlton, and this is among their very best."
"Appearance: Pours a hazy, dull orangish-yellow with a thick, ivory colored head that retains some wispy lacing."
"Canned back in February, curious as to how it held up."
Solid offering - like the hop bitterness and dry finish. Keeps the loosey juiciness reigned in and allow more subtle flavors to come out. Very zesty and nice almost cornmeal malt are the unique flavors here.
Pine and pineapple.
"Hazy orange, one finger head with lots of spotty lacing. Smells of citrus and sweet pineapple with just a hint of pine. Flavors of lemon, grapefruit, bitter rind, and a bit of sweet vanilla and spice. Nice creamy texture and light carbonation."
16 oz. can dated 4/5/18 purchased at brewery and poured into Aslin anniversary glass.
Very close if not at the gates of perfection. Sumptuous mouthfeel and delicate hops flavors. On a scale of 1 to 10 I say fuck scales this broke the scale.
Don’t get the hype but most TH beers I feel the same about
"Had on tap. Pours hazy orange yellow in color with one inch head. Taste is sour orange and light peach. Medium bodied and carbonation, slightly bitter and juicy. Solid but I prefer other tree house ipas."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow wit big fluffy white head. It has medium low carbonation. It smells of kiwi, white grapes, starburst, bubblegum, and strawberry. The beer tastes of kiwi, white grape, Apricot, starburst, and bubblegum. The mouthfeel is very light and smooth. Overall, this is a standout from the Tree House line up."
"Pours a opaque tangerine color with a thick, lingering white head. I did pour aggressively. Smell is of soft mango. Taste is fruity with again the mango and grapefruit standing out. Nice full beer, but still very easy to drink."
Look- Dark Hazy Orange
"Pours a semi dirty hazy golden. Grapefruit, mango, and white grape on the nose. A little bit of banana, mango, and grapefruit, some drying, peppery bitterness. A touch of white grape too. This is a super drinkable IPA that greatly reminds me of Fort Point Pale Ale, one of my all time favorites."
"Good look and nose. Pours a light orange. Smells of orange and papaya standout. Taste is earthy and fruity which shows the hop profile of the beer. Has a lasting citrus/piney taste, and in a very good way. Feel was medium and good. Felt like a good proper beer and not thin as some of their other beers (eg, Hurricane). A very good IPA."
So this is my first Treehouse brew. And while this is good. I'm a little let down. The beer itself is beautiful looking. 5/5 for sure. 
"Fully opaque dark orange to tan with very large off white foam settling like a root beer float with a large mound in the middle, leaving some fuzzy lace at the very top edge of the glass."
Pours light orange. Very light lacing. Aroma of orange peels and mango. Taste follows the nose with grape and orange juice. Great ipa as are all from treehouse.
L: Light glowing orange.
delicious just absolutely delicious.
Cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a combined citrus and hops. Taste is a nice citrus hoppy that is a nice blend.
"SAmpling a cold 16 oz can poured into a snifter. The beer pours a hazy golden rod color with creamy dense bleached white head of 3 cm foaming up even with a gentle pour. The foam fades slowly to a wispy island in the center of my glass and very tight clingy lattice on my glass. This lattice sticks for a LONG time during my sampling, actually to the end of the glass. "
Canned two weeks ago.
"The look is what we have become to expect of a Treehouse IPA, and is on par with making you drool for your first sip. The smell is subtly sweet and bitter as you could imagine, but very faint and not over-powerful at all. When you taste this it all comes together as one of the better IPA's out of Treehouse. A strong hop bite to your tongue that fades quickly leaving the desperation for another sip. The Feel and aftertaste are very enjoyable, very nicely blended and watery in the best way. Overall, I'm very impressed that we have been given another amazing selection that is quite different than that of any other Beer from Treehouse. Reminds me of OH DDH Space Diamands as a single IPA. Keep em' coming Nate. Please?"
A- hazy golden color with a whitehead that sticks for days
Canned 6 days ago.
"pours out a nice hazy golden straw color, bright white head with excellent retention and lacing. on aromas and palate are pithy citric and danky herbaceous notes, well complimented by some grapefruit, soft tropical and nectarine character, musty earthy qualities and a hint of bready malts.... nice bite of pine on the finish. mouthfeel is pretty soft, some decent texture. overall an excellent IPA - very well balanced and brings a lot of flavor for a < 7% IPA, nice stuff!"
"Very nice beer...clean and bright tasting with a bit more of a ""west coast"" feel and a slight bitter but nice taste....I would drink this regularly!!"
"Had it a while back and didn't report on it, was lucky enough to get in on 12 cans today. It is better than I remember, really damn good beer. I love all the TH offerings but I think that this one, while more rare than most, is maybe the best I've had here. REALLY...GOOD....BEER"
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with white head. Aroma is citrus and some tropical fruits. Not as robust of an aroma as some tree house beers. Flavors of orange, papaya, mango, melon. Well balanced very well done IPA"
"Can dated 4/14/17. Pours like the rest and taste like the best! Seriously though the NE hazy beers from tree house are fruity, smooth, crushable, enjoyable and addictive. Wish i lived closer. This beer is incredible and 2 months old! Cheers."
"Pours a hazy yellow orange with a two inch head that quickly dissipates and leaves behind a small white ring and not much lacing at all. It smells of tropical fruit, citrus, and just a slight hint of bubble gum; a touch of pine at the very tip of the nose as well. No specific fruit really jumps out at you. Taste is light and just a touch sweet in the middle with a dry finish. A touch too bitter for my own taste on the back end. Leaves a pleasant candyish aftertaste along the lines of green but not nearly as sweet or pronounced. The biggest knock on this beer is that it is too thin. It feels downright watery; but that is really the only knock on an otherwise great beer. It has elements of the big three: the nose of julius, aftertaste of green, look and taste of a lighter haze. This beer is great and is a surprising ambassador for the treehouse line up."
Pours a glowing hazy honey color. Aroma is big citrus up front with some mango and papaya. Flavor is tropical fruit and a refreshing juicy citrus with a really smooth feel. The body is pretty great on this and overall an absolutely delicious beer.
"had this in a can. terrific hazy look. smell was light, but fruity with hints of grapefruit. mouth feel was terrific. dense and full flavor. love what treehouse is doing."
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 4-14-2017) into a Veil Brewing House glass 
"At this point, I'm more shocked when I'm disappointed by any Tree House. This is packed full of tropical smell and very citrusy flavor. No bitterness at all. Loved it."
"First had 4/19/17 at home on trade from Andy K. Nice and cloudy, orangish in color. I could go on and on about flavors, but the short version is a mixture of Julius and Green. Always happy to try Tree House."
Just another wonderful beer from Treehouse. Everything you'd expect in a TH IPA - full of juicy citrus goodness while also being very well balanced. What else can be said - Treehouse kills it.
"wow just another simple smooth amazing IPA from Treehouse. Pungent citrus aroma with a super fluffy pillowy mouthfeel, Interesting finish that I couldn't point out but probably due to palate fatigue. Would like to revisit but really awesome IPA from TH yet again."
Canned 4/14/17; drank 4/22/17 @ the Yarchives. 
A 12 oz. can dated 4-14-17 poured into a Tree House Teku
"A really top notch offering from Tree House! This beer stands out from other Tree House IPAs in that it's more subtle on the fruit flavors and lighter on the palate. It's less juicy than Julius, less piney than Green, but more resiny than Tree House pale ales (i.e. Lights On), and is delicately bitter with hints of grapefruit and vinous characteristics at the end from the Nelson hops. This is a beer that's about balance-- it shows off the features that make Tree House IPAs great without any particular feature being overwhelming (fruitiness, bitterness, resin, etc.)-- the result is an amazingly drinkable IPA that is eminently enjoyable on a warm spring day!"
"Bonus points to this beer for having an adorable backstory. That aside, this beer pours beautifully and rocks the classic treehouse appearance. Full, almost milky yellow-orange look. Taste and smell are a bit subtler relative to some of the treehouse staples, but it is still amazingly delicious. Slighty citrusy and tropical, it leaves an addictive aftertaste that sits on the palate."

ISO till 12/22
glad I got to try this again. this beer pours nice marmalade and thick as hell just like all treehouse beers. nice pillowy head with nose busting with nelson hops. getting white grapes with pine and some perfume like scents. nice thick mouthfeel holds this beer togeather. let's get to the taste. ... up front bitterness with tropical mango and passion fruit . some orange giving way to some dryness and typical but subdued nelson hops nuances. finishes with nice hoppy dryness. I remember having this last year and I was really big into nelson hop stuff. I loved this beer then but now not as much. that's not too say anything bad about this beer cause it is very good. I feel like I enjoy some of their other offerings more. overall another top notch ipa from treehouse. all their beers get better as they get warmer and this is no exception. only once a year makes this beer ectra special.
"I bought these upon release, traded a bunch and just now decided to have one of the two I had left. I'm glad I did..."
"Maybe I am a little biased, but almost everything that Tree House puts their hands on turns to gold. I got ahold of a can of this rare release and it tastes almost as good as Julius. Great orange juice color and haze. Lots of lacing. Smells like oranges and maybe a little guava. Tastes more of guava with orange and a bitter grapefruit backend. Very creamy mouthfeel that makes you drink it a little faster than you would have liked. This beer is worth savoring but hard to not just pound away."
Just Perfect. Only the fifth beer out of 100 I rated a 5.0

Tree House In Perpetuity
From a can dated 9/22/16.
"This tastes a lot like a cuvee of Julius and Green. Typically high Tree House quality, but I would place it a bit behind the usual suspects of Julius, Green, Haze and their variations. For almost any other brewery, this would be a flagship."
"Cloudy yellow orange, foamy white juicy head, some lacing and hop oils cling and run down the glass. Big citrus pineapple nose, pineapple passion fruit and grapefruit flavor. Mild sweetness upfront nicely compliments the bitter finish. Really smooth and drinkable!"
"just so easy to drink . . . . my gosh this stuff is so good.... nothing spectacular on this one. not like the others who have some claim to fame. and the traditional treehouse label. this one is just ordinary,,,, but incredibly ordinary. bland, yet incredibly bland..... can they do any wrong????"
"16 oz can. Pours hazy dull orange color with two finger white head that fades very slowly, leaves gobs of bubbly lacing. Big tropical aroma, pineapple, mild melon. Tastes like it smells, tropical fruit, orange and pineapple, melon, grapefruit. Light malt sweetness is taken over by a solid back end grapefruit peel bitterness, touch of dank weediness. Finishes dry, medium soft feel. Delicious IPA as expected."
L - cloudy orange with white head and minimal lacing
"vintage growler from 9/23...thanks robbie. huge pineapple nose. tasty brew, like almost every tree house pale, India pale, hell most tree house brews are insane. this isn't my favorite but really nice."
"L: Slightly darker burnt orange hues than the typical Tree House IPA, but with the same ample fluffy white head"
9/22/16 can drank on 10/1/16
Drank from a 1 pint can
Consumed one week from canning. Apparent Citra throughout with a bit of dank Nelson hops. One of the softer mouthfeels on a TH IPA I have experienced. Solid but unspectacular.
Canned 9/22/16. Consumed 9/28/16.
"Eh. Not one of my favorites from TH but still a very good beer. Beer snob spoiled at this point to be rating this beer as low as I am but ... I am. Good looks, taste, smell, and mouth feel but FOR ME this isn't even in the top 10 from TH."
Growler shared by jc1762. Many thanks!
"On par with the Big 4 IPAs of Tree House and to me, better than Green and in line with the rest. Reminded me of a split between Julius and Alter Ego, with a bit more smoothness up front but also a little more bland at the end. We compared to a Dopple and Juice Machine and looked amazingly similar to both, a great sign. Hope they brew this more going forward!"
0 days old from can. Opened it cold when received from Tree House
Obtained today at brewery. 
"I remember this one having great hops back when it was fresh. I imagine now it's a pure malt bomb, but hopefully they'll brew it again someday. They used Citra and Nelson, so what bad could come from those two amazing hops???"
"Had this a while back when it was past it's prime. Drank it against Julius and King Julius. Wasn't as good but the age made is a bit malty, but it was still good. Solid beer."
A simply beautiful beer in all regards
"While I was drinking this for the first time it reminded me of a autumn night, with an endless sky. The taste is a bit complex but satisfying. It is going to be one of my favorites."
White head. Hazy orange color. Kind of burnt color.
"Excellent IPA. Great use of Nelson hops not overpowering in a white wine kind of way , but there, noticeable and a nice pairing w the ever delicious Citra. Well done Treehouse"
"Received a 16 oz can in a trade when fresh and poured into a snifter. This beer is all-around amazing. If you didn't know by now, Treehouse has some awesome beers and this might be one of their best offerings! It pours with a decent amount of white-fluffy head, very hazy and peach in color. The smell / aroma is big on this one... you can smell the hops the second you crack open the can. Taste is tropical / citrus-like (same as the Julius). The feel is somewhat thin, but soft on the taste buds. Overall, this is one of the best beers they've offered to date and hope they can it again sometime soon! Cheers!"
"From Notes, Haven't entered in a while. "
Nice and fresh from last canning!! I was able to share this bottle with my friend on his 30th birthday recently and it was amazing! Everything you would expect of a Treehouse IPA! Nelson hops shines through here I don't get as much Citra as I thought...tried this side-by-side with TH Eureka with Mosaic and I actually like that one a little bit better
"Really enjoyed this beer, simple easy drinking ipa, smell doesn't pop like haze or Julius but taste is easy, light pine notes.tropical but refreshingly light"
Delicious
"As a Tree House regular, this one didn't disappoint. Like many of its counterparts, it possessed a floral and citrusy flavor with the pillow-like mouthfeel. An amazing beer that I hope becomes a part of the regular rotation."
One of the best IPAs ever. Period !
"Another great offering from Tree House. Wonderful cloudy color with great tropical nose on the smell. Very Juicy IPA with notes of mango, pineapple and papaya throughout. Nice sweet aftertaste with this beer. Nice smooth mouthfeel."
"Orange murky color with minimal head but good lacing. The nose is beautiful full of sweet/citrus hops. The taste is more sweet then bitter with a good balance of hops and malt, just missing that extra punch other tree house beers like julius has. After taste is more bitter but fades quick. A very good beer."
"This is one of the least interesting IPA out of TrH. Loved the color, which is more of an orange hue, nice head on the pour. Nose is uninteresing subdued ""tropical and citrus"", so was the taste, very uneventful. Nothing that jumped out and said, hey, I'm awesome like Alter Ego or Julius or Green. Still, a good IPA overall."
"All I can say is that I've had an IPA or two and this one blows them all away, including Julius."
Another killer beer from treehouse . They have that perfect hop texture that leaves you licking your lips . The can logo is just great with the colors. Delicious hop taste and the strong and a nose you can smell once you open the can .
16oz bottle into a pint glass
well another winner here
16oz Can.
"A remarkable beer, and one of the best hoppy offering from Tree House this year. Elegant and subtle, but with enough hoppy backbone to hold its own. Loved it."
"Pour is hazed deep orange with lots of tight white head and a fair bit of lacing. Nose is heavily hopped, tons of citrus, gets a bit dense and resinous, moderate melon rind. Flavor is smooth, clean, less dense and resinous, bright juicy hop bill, notes of grain, citrusy, light melon rind, faintly herbal. Well carbonated, fairly light, a touch thin in the finish with moderate to strong carb and a light bitterness."
I had this at Siptemberfest the only beer I stood in the 20plus line for twice!
"Growler from Tree House. Citra + Nelson is amazing! Solid citrus up front with nelson on the back end. Great balance, one of my favorite beers this year!"
"Another great offering from Tree House. Light orange and opaque. Smells like tropical fruit, citrus, and hops. Taste is similar to smell with a slight bitterness and maltiness to balance. Very well rounded flavors. Feel is what you'd expect, soft, smooth, with light carbonation to keep it interesting. Awesome!"
Pours golden hazy orange with a two finger head. Smells of tropical fruit with some dank pine. Taste is a citrus river with mango and oranges that finishes dry and bitter. Really well-rounded and delicious through and through.
16oz can poured into a pint glass.
Sweeet Jeeeesus treehouse has done it again. Nose is a mix of bright orange citrus and tropical fruit. Body is surprisingly light but as the beer warms up a beautiful resiny finish coats the mouth. Amazing beer.
"Missed this release since I was in China, but so glad rudzud grabbed a can for me as I was dying to try this. Great symbolic beer and looks to be a phenomenal beer itself."
A:Pours hazy orange with a good white head and lacing down the glass
Stands with Julius!
"A few of my friends that have had most of the Treehouse cans said that this is their favorite one to date so I went in with super high expectations, which I do with all TH beers. For me, this is definitely one of my favorite, but not my numero uno. I did have a slight cold when I had it so my sense and taste buds may have been off a little. I look forward to trying this one again if it returns!"
"Poured from a 32oz growler on 9/23/15, which was filled on 9/17/15 and delivered in an absolute porch bomb courtesy of SDRedDevil, an amazing BA and great guy! Looks like many other TH beers that I've had, which is to say great. Very non-aggressive pour still led to about 3+ fingers of very fluffy white head (may very well be due to being sent in mail). Very hazy orange in appearance, reminiscent of Alter Ego. "
"The beer comes in a hazy deep orange, almost like peach juice, with a soft fluffy white head."
"thanks Steve for another tree house share. had a small pour, but very impressed. solid ipa, fairly light...almost watery."
Great IPA.
A: Pours a nice cloudy orange with a good white head and good lacing down the glass.
"A: a nice golden, straw color. S: lemon peel, a little mango, some pineapple. T: wow, a fruit forward beer for sure. The hops sing on your tongue...M: the little, crisp mouthfeel of the hop forward IPAs...O: this beer is a delight, just an all around great beer. The hops are super present with a little bitterness...what all IPAs should taste like"
L: Pours a golden orange with about 2 fingers of white head. There's some nice lacing left in the glass as I quickly consume this.
Poured from a 750mL growler into a pint glass. Filled at the brewery 12Sep15 8 days ago.
"Look: Like a mix of pineapple and orange juice, with a nice frothy head"
"Can, pours a cloudy peach orange color, with a thick white foamy head. There is a bit of foamy lacing. The odor for me is tropical fruit, orange, grapefruit, apricot, lemon, slightly spicy, slightly grassy, slight onion, slightly pine. The taste for me is orange, grapefruit, melon, apricot, juicy citrus, passion fruit, guava, pineapple, slightly spicy, slight grassy, not much bitterness."
A- Flip-top poured to four glasses with a highly cloudy golden-apricot body. A thick and creamy white head rises up quickly sticking around for quite some time. Large belt drops sheets and drizzled webs all around the glass.
"Can shared by Dave M, thanks again!"
Very nice IPA. Has the signature Tree House malt finish. This is almost their trademark. All of the ales have the same maltiness. This has a sweet fruity upfront flavor. Very nice pale ale.
Anniversary beer for N&L 
"A: Bright orange, looks to be almost glowing in the light. Hazy with a thick, foamy white head that dissipates very slowly and sticks to the glass."
Growler fill.
"Golden glowing orange, beautifully cloudy, tall khaki head with two creamy fingers of foam, dotted lacing all down the Tire Hands Teku. This is a beautiful beer!"
"This was a great beer, amongst great beer. Tree house is really just absolutely pumping out amazing brews one after another. With that considered sometimes its tough to give a lot of these great beers of there's enough credit. This was one of those beers that is a awesome brew but is only getting 2/3 of the credit bc of how often they put out amazingly top notch brews and so consistently."
16 oz. can poured into a snifter tasting glass day of can release.
"Subtle bitterness, Smooth easy drinking juicy IPA. The hop character is peachy and orange like. So very drinkable. Like no other IPA. I wish I had more of these."
"Simply an amazing offering. Fruity, sour, deep, and juicy. Flavors that can't be described with mere words only emotions. Yah, that good."
"Served from a growler. Pours a hazy golden-orange with a loose white head that dissipates into a soapy skim. Nose expresses sweet citrus upfront followed by grapefruit rind. Taste follows nose; however, rind quality also comes off a bit medicinal in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with an even carbonation. Overall, a very nice American IPA - refreshing and drinkable."
"Poured from the 16oz can dated 09-09-15 into a snifter glass yesterday. Pours an opaque amber color with a great head that leaves lacing. Smells like pure hops, leafy, sweet, juicy, very inviting. First sip reveals a completely different IPA than what I'm used to. It starts off sweet and then goes right into these very unique hops. Very bitter but lots of vegetal fruits like guava, melon, and papaya. Chewy and smooth mouthfeel, really easy to drink the 16oz of this unique IPA. "
Another masterpiece by the best brewery in the world.
Can dated 9/9/15; drank in a Tree House teku on 9/12/15
16 oz can poured into Teku
"I love ALL Treehouse beers. Soft, delicate and bold flavors."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a stout glass (a gorgeous 16 oz can I might add).
"Nice golden color with thick head. Citrusy aroma. Taste is not bitter, nice and citrusy hop aroma and flavor. But a little too sweet for my preference."
"Picked up some cans of this at the brewery. Just a phenomenal story behind this beer and the label. Really, really heart warming. "
"I've never used the word ""soft"" to describe a beer before, but it fits here. The mouthfeel is just incredible. So smooth and perfect amount of bitterness makes it real easy to drink. I felt the flavor leaned more towards the Nelson (Melon/Stonefruit) type flavors, but the citrus was definitely detectable as well. So happy I have 7 more to drink!"
"Poured from the very attractive can into an IPA glass. Similar body and head to Julius: orange, orange, and more orange, with a frothy white head of two fingers. Nose and taste of peach, mango, citrus: again, reminiscent of Julius. I do feel as if I like this beer a bit more. Maybe it drinks a little cleaner, goes down a little smoother. If only I could've enjoyed them side by side! The mouthfeel on this beer is heavenly soft. Quite the wedding anniversary gift if you ask me! A beautiful beer, and an instant winner as far as I'm concerned. I hope this one makes it into the regular rotation at Tree House!!!"
"Just an incredible beer, and I was lucky enough to catch it on the tap line today. This is exactly what you would come to expect from any TH offering. Tons of fruit taste (mango, peach, papaya, melon), a velvety finish, and an overall crushable experience have become de rigueur from the folks in Monson, MA. I'm hoping that the title speaks for itself, and that this beer will brewed again in the near future."
My new favorite Tree House brew. Outstanding.
"Your prototypical treehouse hazy golden orange that fills the room the second the crack the can. This is somewhere between Julius and Curiosity 21 in the best way possible. Bright, juicy and soft orange and a bouquet of ripe citrus that finishes with a dank pine with the perfect amount of depth. People are offering up VR for this stuff for good reason, a beautifully momentous beer for a beautifully momentous occasion."
"Just sensational. Possibly my favorite T House brew. If this beer doesn't make it into their regular rotation, there should be a federal investigation. Tastes like a cross between Green and Julius. Outstanding and incredibly drinkable."
"This a beautiful beer. It pours with a super fluffy off-white head, hazy (but not as hazy as other treehouse beers) dark peach color. Huge aroma from nelson hops. I can smell this beer from 3 feet away. Tropical sweet taste with a very slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and fluffy, but a little thinner than I expected. Getting tons of nelson but not much citra. I enjoyed this so much i am contemplating taking the 3 hour round trip a second time this week before this beer is gone, great follow up to beneficiaries of chance, I just hope it isn't another year before we see this again!"
"L - Dark hazy orange. Glows a murky copper brown in the middle with golden lacing around the edges. Beautiful on its own, but I've seen better from Tree House!"
"L - Hazy, unfiltered dark orange with two fingers of off-white head"
"L: a nice orange and straw mix, almost a creamy look to it"
"Absolute delight! A melange of papaya and peach/mango. Amazing mouth feel that just coats and lingers, with a super balanced bitterness. Aroma smacks you in the face when you open the can, ripe stone fruits! "
"Huge peach nose opening the can. Beautiful apricot/peach color. Incredibly soft mouthfeel, big peach & stone fruit juiciness throughout. Leaves you wanting more. I've been enjoying TH brews since their early days on St. Clair Road and Nate & crew continue to raise the bar! Get your max allotment if you can this week! IMHO one of my fave from them. Hoping they brew this again!"
A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color and poured with a short white head that left lots of wisps of lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
L - massive head atop a glowing orange body.
"I unfortunately can't get down with 100% Citra IPAs much anymore (with the exception of Double Citra from HF - drool) - the overpowering qualities of cat pee dominate here; good to try though, and a great body for what it is."
From the tap: 
Thanks to Mr. Beer_Economicus for this Charlotte beauty.
"On tap at the brewery. Get there EARLY to get a park. My favorite draft IPA to date, smooth and power-flavors with excellent finish. Great staff at Heist let me sample others without asking. Highest recommendation! Also got some 16 oz cans for my homeboys as I live 259 miles away"
Citra hops shine through. Bitter finish that lingers for a bit. Juicy mouthfeel.
"Canned 07/06/18, so 10 days ago."
"Strong citra aroma and low bitterness. Super fruity and extremely cloudy. Great beer, love heist. Definitely one of the best breweries in Charlotte"
"Overall, a really good beer from a really cool brewery in Charlotte"
"Crowler, shared with friends on 5/26 - Citraquench'l pours a light, attractive yellow-orange. It looks a bit like Tang, actually, plus carb! It smells fantastic - sweet and full of citrus."
Poured from a three hour old crowler. 
On tap at Southern Grist. Bright yellow haze with a fluffy white head. Huge Citra aroma. All citrus and berries with no catty notes. The taste stood up to the nose. Great and bright citrus Notes with a faint underlying dankness. Bready malt. Just outstanding.
"A pale, murky, juicy looking beer with a nice light and sticky head. The nose is full of grapefruit, papaya, a tiny bit of green onion and pine. Sweet caramel, bitter citrus pith, grapefruit and pine. Finishes dry with a big pine aftertaste. Very good beer."
"Pours hazy orangeish yellow. Foamy, tall white head that lasts A while with good lacing."
"Pours a turbid, peach-flesh like color with two and half fingers of white foamy head. Head forms eagerly even out of an 8 day old crowler. Lovely lacing left behind as well. Splendid start to the drinking experience. Aroma is tropical fruits - specifically, papaya, mango, and pineapple with a sweet marmalade note in the back. On the hop spectrum of bitter to sugary sweet, this lands at about a 60% sweet. Not overly so, but just enough to welcome a sip. Flavor profile oozes papaya, mango, pineapple, sweet marmalade, and peaches. Yeast is present, but just barely so, with a dash of biscuit malts in the back. The soft, slightly grainy, calcium-like feeling keeps this beer drinking smooth delivering those wonderful hop notes. It has a medium thickness that fills out the palate well without drinking like a meal. Overall, a sublime NE IPA. Loads of hop notes that remain well balanced. It is a touch sweet, but isn't overly so. "
"L: cloudy, yellow orange, nice lacing, looks like a milkshake "
This could be the best NE IPA in the country. Did a taste test against several NE breweries and nothing came close.
Hazy straw color with a slighly white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and slight hops that is very pleasant. Taste is also a grapefruit and slight hops that is very appealing.
Poured from a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass.

"This is easily one of the best, most surprising IPAs I've come across in a while. Had this while I was in Charlotte and it was easily the best beer I had on my trip. Not to knock the rest of their beer, but this was by far their standout. I had it on tap and from a crowler a couple days later and it was just fantastic. Locally, it reminds me a lot of what Triple Crossing does in Richmond, but it was just better all around. Absolutely fantastic beer I hope they start making more readily available so I can trade for it. It's worth it."
Appearance - Pours bright orange hazy with thick fluffy white head that lasts forever. Lots of stringy lacing all over the glass.
Fantastic IPA. Crowler filled on 3/3. Hazy/murky orange in appearance. So tropical on the nose and flavor. Just super delicious. Really glad to have tracked this down. Excellent brew!
What a great beer. Had Treehouse Julius a few months ago and I don't think I could tell the difference. Looks like turbid oj. Just a fantastic beer.
I felt this one lived up to the hype - super hazy orange juice of an IPA. It was delicious. I've since had a couple others from Heist and these guys are the real deal...I'm pissed I hit up NaDa instead of them the last time I was in Charlotte.
"Leaping firmly on the northeast bandwagon, these North Carolina temporarily place themselves in the northeast when putting together this juicy IPA."
Wow! This beer totally blew me away!
"Pours a murky bright orange--looks like a glass of orange juice. Nose is awesome: so much tropical fruit and orange. The taste is candied orange, peach, pineapple. Very little bitterness. Feel is super smooth. Overall, what an amazing beer. Citra is one of my favorite hops and this beer showcases it extremely well."
"Thick bright sunny-D look with a full head of foam, dissipates slowly, looks incredible. Aroma is all citra goodness, mangos and papaya, light lemon zest and some mellow white cracker. Big punch of hops - all tropical fruit dessert. Clean and not quite soft but less abrasive than expected. Clean bitter hops with a quick dry-wine finish, I enjoy that, it reminds you of and old school hop bomb but ends so nicely you want to immediately dive back in for more. An awesome IPA that I would only be so lucky to try again in the future."
Can
A: Pours an almost completely opaque super murky burnt orange in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation along the edges of the glass and moderate deep golden yellow highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense foamy beige head that slowly reduces to a medium sized half finger thick cap in the center of the glass surrounded by a large patch of thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
Can thanks to Jesse
"This was an excellent IPA. The aromas exploded out of the glass and the look of the brew was hazy orange as I would expect. The flavors were not as amazing as the smell, but still great"
L - hugely juicy yeasty murky orange brown. Solid shade of color. Bone white creamy frothy head with stellar lacing. Desperately clinging to the sides of the glass as the beer decreases. 
"I rarely give a beer five stars but this is the best NE style IPA I've ever had (and I've tried everything good from up north). Big, hazy juicy beer, perfectly balanced. it has delicious citrusy flavors that linger in your mouth long after you drink it. They don't produce this on a regular basis but need to start."
Can poured into chalice
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.
"There is a new king in the Queen City and it goes by the name of Heist Brewery. These guy are making fantastic beers. Citraquential is such a juicy hazy IPA. Great looking, great smelling and great tasting beer."
16 oz can.
fresh batch (9/24/16 canning I think) drank on 10/1/16
"16 oz can. Pours opaque deep orange color, two finger head lasts awhile leaving tons of scattered lacing. Sweet tropical fruit aroma. Taste is full of tropical fruit flavor and plenty citrus, but this is balanced immediately by dank, weedy hops. Finishes dry with grapefruit peel, pine, and more weed. Med to full soft feel. Loving this style right now and this one is top notch."
Canned 9/23/16. Consumed 9/29/16.
"Pours a hazy orange with a great citrus aroma. Taste has an amazing juicy burst with a great citrus and hop balance. A bit thicker than I would expect, but perfect for the beer. Overall an amazing beer. Definitely holds up to IPAs from NE."
Test Citra IPA that I was lucky enough to to get from one of my solid trade partners! Great Citra hop burst and a nice strong but not overpowering finish!!
"Simply put, Citraquench'l can hold its own against any IPA out there. After wrecking my palate with the likes of Tree House and Trillium, I'm ecstatic to finally see a world class IPA coming out of Charlotte. This is the best IPA I've had from the South East to date, can't wait to see this canned regularly."
Pours a hazy orange color with about a 1 inch foamy head. Great head retention. Smells of grapefruit. Taste is of pineapple and grapefruit with a nice mildly dry finish with a nice mile bitterness. Best IPA I have had from NC.
"At this point I had 3 cans of this over the last 3 weeks and am blown away by just how good this lasted. Hazy straw color with a burst of citrus aroma. Taste is smooth, juicy, bright, and balanced. One of the best IPA's I have had recently."
Pour is very murky. Just like orange juice. Small head. Nice Lacing.
"An okay ipa, EXTREMELY cloudy with aggressively tart citrus aromas."
"L: Rich and cloudy honeycomb and peach hues with an ample fluffy white head and great retention/lacing - gorgeous coloring that rivals my gold standard for the style, DDH Congress St."
"Look: Pours a thick, deep orange/yellow, the color of orange juice. Great head which settled down about halfway through the glass but retained the lacing throughout. "
"Appearance: The murkiest beer I have ever seen, the color of beeswax,; the head is modest but the lacing is quite good"
Quite possibly the best IPA in the Carolina's.
"Hands down the best IPA in the Carolinas! Hazy, juicy, all Citra IPA...well done!"
"Hands down the best IPA that's come out of NC, better than any I've tasted coming out of SC or Virginia for that matter."
"Wow! Exceptional beer from these guys. Certainly one of the best IPA's I have had, EVER. Can't wait for these guys start canning some of their hops. I hope for everyone's sake that the NE style IPA lives forever because this brewery has found its calling and I have found my preference."
Blown away by this IPA. It is easily a top 5 IPA for me. Orange julius with a crap ton of hops is what it seems like to me. This beer stood out at a share that included many of the great NE and west coast hops.
"Heist has really stepped up their game. A year ago, ask a beer guy or gal in the area about Heist and the typical response would be the food and craft cocktails are great, the beer, not so much."
The best hazy IPA I've had south of the Mason-Dixon.
Wow. Had no idea going into a pour of this from a friend. No expectations at all in the midst of drinking several highly rated and acclaimed brews...
"What an amazing beer!!! Ive been fortunate to have had plenty of beers in the last couple of years from Treehouse, Trullium and the other heavy hitters coming out of the Northeast. I have fallen in love with the style and have had quite the itch that has needed to be scratched with the availability of these beers in NC. Holy shit!! Heist has given me the fix that i have so needed. All of their NE style beers have been incredible but Citraquenchal has been the best of them all!! The smell is all late, tropical hop additions that create this ""hop dust meets orange juice"" aroma that makes me want to quit drinking any other liquids in my life. The color is somewhere between orange juice and grapefruit juice. Just looking at the beer makes my mouth salivate. The taste is exactly what i want in an ipa. Pure, clean, light orange juice that was dry hopped with finely ground hop fairy dust with hardly a hint of bitterness. Is this even beer or is this what liquid viagra tastes like? Its hard to believe the ibu's in this beer still fall into an ipa classification. We did a tasting along side of Treehouse Julius and Bright and Citraquenchal was the best. They were all similar but the finish on yhe Citraquenchal was superior. I am so thankful to be able to enjoy these beers without having to give up beers that I had to wait in line for and pay twice as much per oz for. Thank you Heist for making my dreams come true!! The only reason why there arent 5's across the board is because I know Heist has yet to make their best IPA yet and I am saving those 2 fives for the ""perfect beer""."
"This is without a doubt the best IPA that I can think of in NC, if not the south. Extremely hazy, hoppy, orange juice is the best description for it. Worth seeking out."
"Pours like pure orange juice. Medium lacing on the glass. The nose is a bouquet of grapefruit, orange, and floral notes. Appearance is very hazy. Drinks like pure juice. Very easy drinking 6.7% beer."
"On tap a Salud in Charlotte. Look is murky and juicy. Smell is all citra hops. Taste is juicy, fruity, sweaty and delicious. Feel is perfect. This is the best IPA in North and South Carolina. Congrats guys."
"Really hazy orange color. Aroma has quite intense overripe fruit notes, green tea and herbs. Taste follows sweet and herbal, quite intense but pleasant."
"L - Slightly dark orange color, murky body, finger of head"
Opaque sherbet orange with a moderate off-white foam that quickly settles to a sparse bubbly film.
"Drank on tap at Five Horses Tavern, Somerville, MA"
"This is an insane juice bomb. Thick creamy mouth feel, insane fruity smoothie nose and taste is the same. Pineapple, Mango, Orange with a hint of bitterness at the finish."
It has an amazing milkshake thickness about it. I definitely tasted orange creamsickle among other fruit flavors. There is almost no bitter bite either.
This beer is so great that I registered an account just to say Trillium REALLY needs to put this one into their regular rotation. Tastes of pineapple/cantaloupe/grapefruit shine here like no other DIPA I've ever had. The mouthfeel/carbonation/ABV combo works perfectly too. Excellent stuff.
"The beer pours a murky hazy yellow with a thin layer of white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of dank resin, pineapple, melon, kumquat, and pine. It tastes of pineapple, dank resin, peach, melon, kumquat, and pine. The feel is light and crushable. This is a great IPA from trillium, I hope this becomes a regular."
Easily one of the best IPAs I’ve had. Blows away anything Galaxy focused I’ve had in the past. Pineapple and melon candy. Please get this to regular rotation
"Pours a cloudy, turbid orange color. Huge soapy bright white foam head. Nose is splendid! Notes of melon, peaches, pineapple, citrus peel and lemon. Very fruit forward. Taste of ripe pineapple, grapefruit, ripe cantaloupe, lemon zest and bottled peaches. Small bit of sticky malt in there but it is quickly overtaken by the fruit. Rich creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Very low on bitterness. Almost has a sugary sweetness to it at points (bottled peaches) but it definitely finishes hoppy and fairly dry."
16 oz. canned on 04/10/18
"Humongomuos thanks to robbie for the uber fresh tick...I mean the dude has a baby less than a week ago, but still all over that Mass beer run. Gotta love that commitment to the game!"
L - looks like liquid sunset coming out of the can. Settles dark. Real dark. Murky orange brown. 
Pineapple goodness
"Awesome! Probably my favorite Trillium beer. The hoppiest one so far. Oily, resiny, buttery hops..not bitter.. Just the cryo hop flavor I love"
"Canned 4/10/18, pored into an IPA glass"
I agree with everything that dude below me said.
16oz can dated 4/10/18.
"Pours golden straw.one finger white head. Nice lacing. Aroma pineapple and tropical fruits. Taste follows the nose with orange juice, peach and mango. Great collaboration."
"SO GOOD! I bought a couple of these 4 packs last time around! Amarillo, Motueka, Citra, Mosaic and Galaxy you cant go wrong!"
"Looked forward to this one big-time as I love both breweries that were involved in this collaboration. I was quite surprised at how high this was rated - not that this was a disappointment - but it just seemed to lack a bit of oomph to put it over to top. As it was, this beer was juicy, smooth, and easy to quaff...but in all honesty, would that really come as a surprise?"
Absolutely incredible beer. Top 5 Other half if not maybe The top.
"Smell: Tropical fresh fruit juice. Loads of fresh cut pineapple and mandarin oranges. Mango, papaya, peach. Light bready malt sweetness.Grapefruit zest and fresh cut grass as well."
"L - Hazy orange, with thick white head"
"This beer is about a hint better than the DDH Citra + Galaxy that came out in the same release, but only by a notch or two. Veering on 4.75 on taste this one packs a hoppy wallop. Lots of stone fruit and guava flavors but backed up by a resinous and leafy backbone. Very drinkable."
4.31/5 rDev +0.9%
"L -- Pours a hazy, nearly turbid yellow, very similar looking to orange juice -- not my preference, but I imagine this looks exactly as they wanted it to. Large, frothy pure-white head that reduces to a lacing around the edges. Some lacing, but not extensive. "
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
"Very solid beer. Malts are really nice, provide a clean and crisp cracker-like flavor. Hops here are a bit more cryptic, given the blend, but definitely get nice tropical fruit notes, including mango and most interestingly starfruit. Smooth and milky mouthfeel makes it an easy beer to drink, though it does have a bit of a bite from the carbonation which is nice. Overall well balanced"
Wow another home run DIPA we have ourselves here.
"This is one of those fruit smoothie beers... Medium gold, juice-like opacity, tall head of foam, webby lacing left behind... Aromas predominantly citric, followed by a juicy, citrusy, plush-bodied beer... Amarillo, Motueka, Citra, Mosaic, and Galaxy hops with both wheat and oat malts provide a super beer drinking experience... Smooth and soft, full of bright fruit notes, mildly bitter, moderately sweet, and lushly carbonated... A real winner at 8.7% abv..."
"Wow wow wow. What to say about this brew. This may be in fact the best OH beer to date. I’ve had almost all OH brews and this collab just kills it. My fav so far was Raining Threes but this might surpass it. Just an incredibly delicious juice bomb. Nice slight bitterness, slick mouthfeel, bomb nose, huge smooth tropical smooth taste that finishes so killer. Congrats guys. What an accomplishment."
"Super hazy color, almost creamy looking. The nose is strongly yet smoothly citrusy and piney. The taste is full, holy but oh so smooth like a great NE IPA can be. Feel is super thick yet drinkable. This is a fantastic beer, up their with OH 3rd anniversary and Sand City One. Amazing."
This is the perfect IPA.
"Looks thickly yellow and grey, including some color in the head."
Swung by sand city to try it on tap but it was already kicked. Thank goodness for Kevin and Robbie pouring some cans...jesus this is good. Dare I say the best beer from both breweries...by a mile and a half! Everything I love about sand city mixed w everything I love about other half
"A: Murky and golden. Vibrant in hue, but filled with enough sediment to absorb the light needed to illuminate that vibrancy. Ends up looking sorta muddy in low light, but hold it up to something bright to unleash that pineapple juice appeal. Sudsy white head with good retention."
"This is, in my opinion, the best beer to have come out of other half. A smidge better than the answer collab. Pure citrusy heaven. Get to while you can."
"Everything you'd expect this to be. Great foam retention with a deep yellow/amber haze on the aggressive pour. Well blended, this should age nicely over the coming weeks. Candied hops with a nice floral scent, plus the wet dank that we all love. The scent carries over to the palate and sours up at the end leaving the desire for another sip. This is a serious brew, get it while you can."
"Can split from today's release, it pours cloudy yellow gold color with a creamy off white head that leaves good spotty lacing. Typical NE IPA looks which I expect from both Other Half and Sand City."
Honey was not a good thing in this one
"10/2016 - Massive Mosaic presence on the nose, with earthiness popping front and center, plus some honey; body is a bit creamier, nice honey notes too; intense hop bite at the end."
"Picked this up at trillium in boston 10 days ago and drank one of them that night. It was very good but a bit bitter. Had another one tonight and it was bursting with juiciness and flavor. My mouth is watering. Might be worth leaving in the fridge for a week or two. This is one of the best trillium beers, thus the best beers ive ever had. Definitely the best double ipa ive ever had"
Lil to hoppy for me - did not get the sweetness I was expecting
"One of my favorite double IPAs. Trillium in Mass. got this one right. Brewed with raw local honey, the hop flavors in this hazy are amazing. Citrusy heavy."
"Medium gold beer with a light haze and a few fingers of ivory white foam... 3/21/18 canning... One can produced a lot of chunky sediment, while the other did not despite being from the same batch... Go figure..."
Galaxy and citra varieties crush this one
"It tastes like beer mixed with copious amounts of honey. A friend of mine drove all the way to Boston, snagged a bunch of Trillium beer, brought them back to CT, and a sampling we did do. I wish Cutting Tiles wasn't the first one I tried. It reminded me of drinking Dundee's Honey Brown Lager back in high school. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment, but there were kids underneath playing laser tag, and I was afraid of spilling it on them. Imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in Cutting Tiles. I thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties, but the 4.5 point World Class reviews for this beer are completely misleading. I think the beer is just riding the coattails of Trillium's other quality recipes. I desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site. This beer is terrible. Save yourself the drive, buy a double Mosaic IPA that somehow tastes like a pilsner, and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go, Cutting Tiles. Also, if you like tea and honey, try tea and Cutting Tiles. Oh, and I heard they're partnering with General Mills to make Cutting Tiles Nut Cheerios. Honey Boo-Boo is changing her name to Cutting Tiles Boo-Boo."
Glows a beautiful golden orange hue - check
Draft at the brewery. 
"Poured a hazy orange with nice lacing... small head .... tastes of honey, mango, light pineapple... very juicy and smells all same .... ever so slight bitter finish more sweet honey ... great overall beer and can’t wait for more .... first trillium experience and couldn’t be happier"
"A hazy lemon color with accents of tea. 1 finger of bubbly, puffy head that recedes to a line of bubbles. "
"A 1 pint can, with strangely no visible canned on date (looks like it got cut off the side of the can). Can was also quite severely deformed on the top (my fault), which made it extremely hard to open, although I somehow managed it in the end. Doesn’t appear to have affected the beer with no leaks. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass."
This beer was solid. Not sure its world class but def i great beer. something about the color made me give it a 5 not sure if its the honey or what
"Trillium is an impressive brewer and this beer is well developed but in my opinion not their best. Pipeworks has devised beers with honey far superior than Cutting Tiles/Artaic such as Sure Bet and even Spotted Puffer. Orange haze, decent head, underwhelming in flavor based on hype. Light/lacking in a zing that I was expecting. Another great beer from Trillium but my conflated expectations spoiled my experience."
"L: Hazy orange, high level of opacity. Great fluffy head"
"Tasted from bottle. Pours a cloudy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruits and floral notes. Taste is very well balanced. Flavors of melon, pineapple, mango, caramel, floral notes. Very well done imperial IPA."
Can thanks to Kevin.
16oz. can into a Heady Topper stemless pint. 
"Not much to look at once poured into the glass. No backlit props - is just like to see a little more activity and vibrancy in the glass. Nose is wonderful - fruit bomb. I get pineapple and mango along with some nice true honey notes. Taste is almost overwhelming but the body keeps all those strong, sweet malts and late hops at bay."
Wow this beer is great!
Its amazing to say this but as great as this beer is its not even in my top 5 from Trillium. That's why Trillium is one of my favorite Brewery's. So good every time and this is another winner. So tasty and smooth.
Got this on delivery from a friend. Another fantastic offering from Trillium which is the best in southern New England the more I have of it. So many unique offers and this is another. Wish I had more!
Canned two weeks ago. 
"Pours an opaque orange with two fingers of white head that foam up quickly and retain well. A few patches of lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, mango, and clementine with a residual citrus sugar. Honey, and flower hops round out a lively aroma. Flavor profile is very similar with notes of orange, mango, and tangerine. Honey sweetens the already citrusy-sweet flavor. Flowery hop notes with a slight bitterness finish out the flavor profile. Mouth feel is smooth, and velvety with a medium-thick feel. Overall, a naturally-sweet tasting DIPA that drinks smooth and tasty. Big aroma, with a flavor profile that nearly matches. "
"Golden orange hue no completely hazy as some light is coming thru. All mosaic nose upon cracking the can open. So good. Taste is very smooth, peaches and vinous flavors. Nice malt finish and hop bite. Dry on the finish. Very fluffy and creamy mouth feel. Lots of sediment in this can which is the first I have noticed in any of the Trilliums I have had. But still simply awesome."
12 oz pour on tap into tulip glass.
16oz can poured into speiglau glass. Canned on 10-MAY-17
"Poured 5/17/17 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 5/15/17, into a tulip glass."
A: Poured from the growler into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy golden with a small ecru-colored head.
Canned 3 days ago (combining ratings with a can of Mosaic drank the day of canning).
"Like grapefruit, pith and juice and alcohol too. Oh wait, I only wish there was booze in my grapefruit cause I'd spend a lot less on beer. This is the good stuff. Each sip builds on itself to a fruit explosion. I've had a few batches of cans and some on draft at the brewery and I loved it all. If there was a cost addendum to the rating, that would hurt my overall score. I do know how much these hops cost though, so I do hope they keep their contracts and push out this beer again. Great work as always, and very much worth the drinking experience!"
LOVE THIS BEER: 
The beer comes in a medium gold color with a full haze.
poured from 16 oz can
"Expected this to be sweeter on account of the honey, but it was perfect. The mosaic hops came through very well and excellently balanced the honey. Delicious"
"L: Obviously hazy, but sort of a dull haze for the style. Tiny off-white head."
A: cloudy; deep gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a very thin wispy cap; nice lacing;
"drank fresh from can dated 1/6/13. nice looking brew. typical hazed appearance, white head, little bit of lacing. "
One of the best IPA's I've had from Trillium. Much better than the citra version. YUUUUUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!
Honey IPA ? Eh.
This was one of my favorites of the Trilliams that I was able to get my hands on. Looks great. Smells great. Tastes great. What else can you ask for from a beer?
"I had the Citra hopped Cutting tiles compared to the mosaic hopped that is currently for release now. Cutting tiles is one of my favorite Trillium beers. Super juicy with a bright golden yellow haze. About an inch of fluffy white head. The typical grapefruit, apricot, peach notes up front with a mild bitter finish, but not over-powering."
"This beer is Hopslam with infinite nuance. An incredibly dank, bitter, world class west-coast IPA submerged in a vat of honey."
"After a semi-vigorous pour yields a one inch head, it reduces shortly to a ring with a little lacing. Nice nose of pine, citrus, tropical fruit and a slight sweetness from the honey. Taste follows nose, gets even better as it warms a bit. Very nice mouth feel. Nice finish aided by the honey which cuts the bitterness somewhat. I would never turn this one down!"
"Golden with a literal ton of floaties and minimal head. Nose is mosaic hops, tropical fruits, dank. Taste is juicy fruits, a little grape, pineapple juice. Mouth is super thick and chewy. Pretty good if you like mosaic."
"Pours clear, gold in color with 3/4 inch head. Taste is deep sweet honey comb with dank hops, with wildflower petal. Perhaps the most honey forward IPA that I have had. Medium-light bodied, sweet, with high carbonation. Interesting and tasty IPA. Glad I got a four pack. 3,000+ beers tried and I thought I have tasted most taste combinations, yet this one is fresh, new, and surprising."
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/11/16, served in an imperial pint/nonic."
Smell : out of this world! Hits you right away. Amazing 
Pours nicely and looks a hazy yellow golden orange in the glass. Smell is citrus with pineapple predominating. Taste is juicy up front with notes of mango and sweet in the middle with a slight and pleasant bitterness on the back end. Feel is medium light. Overall a solid beer though it is a tad heavy in what is going on.
Can dated 07/26/16.
"Had on draft at Brewer's Fork in August. Great aroma of stone fruit. Pretty light body for a DIPA and just delicious. This and DDH Scaled are my two favorites from Trillium, would love to try more."
"16oz can, poured into a 12oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 8.24.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal. "
L: Feel like i am looking at a dried mango with a regal white mushroom on top
"Golden apricot with a big white head and nice lacing. Big dank fruity nose. Notes of caramelized peaches, dank, herbal green stuff, tart white grape and honey dipped hop resin. Medium body, coating and smooth but crisp as well with light alcohol heat and a slightly dry finish. Just a really solid DIPA."
"Holy balls Batman! Can we just hook up an IV drip? Bordering on hazy, bitter perfection here. A hoppy fruit basket for your face hole that will leave you in immediate withdrawal."
"Hazy peach color with a bit of off-white foam. Aroma is tropical and juicy with pineapple and mandarin notes. Taste starts with bittersweet orange and dank, grassy flavors. Heavy body with great carbonation. Really good of example of a New England IPA with a good amount of bitterness."
A - Poured a hazy bright orange colour with a thin layer of eggshell coloured head.
By far the best brew I've had from them. The aroma and flavor is amazing
"From a can dated 7/26/16 into a tulip glass.Golden orange color with a nice opaqueness. 1F head with light lacing which quickly dissipates. Nose is bright citrus with pineapple and orange in the front. Taste is sweet with terrific fruit notes that rounds to some bitterness. Nice mouthfeel with the carbonation mentioned in other reviews. Overall, a delicious balance of sweet and bitter."
"swung out to canton today to grab some cans, had it on draft and dug it, but found the can later in the day to be much more tasty. super great beer. artaic. great batch."
"750 mL dated 2/25/16 poured 7/6/16 into a Duvel tulip. Slightly hazy deep golden with minimal head. Nose of pineapple, orange, green apple, and some must. Taste starts with a malt and honey sweetness that is wrapped in pineapple, then finishes with some bitterness. Not getting the stone fruits, so maybe age is coming onto play. Full bodies and average carbonation."
"I've had this beer several different times and I think the double dry hopped Trilliums are the best. Still great hop taste, I've never gotten a bad batch of this and will always buy this if it is for sale. Great hop taste."
"25 oz. bottle, no date, but person who gave to me (thanks Khalil!) indicates no more than 3 weeks old today. Poured into Kane tulip glass."
"Beautiful golden color....opaque, but not turbid"
"Lightly hazy amber gold--much clearer than other Trillium beers. A fizzy finger of head dies to a persistent bubble layer with a thick collar leaving spotty lace. There was a noticeable floater or two, which is surprising considering their attention to detail."
"Overdue review, Had this maybe 3 or 4 months ago and it was a total onion bomb. I had read alot of other reviews that said the same, so i am hoping (and pretty sure) they had a bad batch. Literally every other beer I've ever had from Trillium has been spectacular. Would like to try a more recent batch"
wow. so light! so fruity and sweet. can taste the wildflower and honey. slight funky organic flavor in there but overall a great twist to Dialed In and no after taste....
"Poured a nice orange color with a slight haze. Smell is citrus hops, which is not overly powerful. To taste, the honey adds a slight sweetness, but not too much. Elegant, light, citrus - so easy to drink. Smooth finish. Overall, a nicely balanced beer that I would drink over and over again."
"Appearance: Orange and gold, a bit hazy. "
"A bit different from the usual trillium offering. Poured from a bottle to a tulip. Orange color; a bit hazy. Smell is slight citrus, not strong. The wild honey balances the mosaic hops. The finish is smooth with the honey flavor. This one is better than the last batch with much less, maybe only a hint, of onion flavor. Overall great beer. I'll get this one again."
"I'm so grateful to Paul for grabbing me nearly a case of this incredible beer. Hazy, yellow body with a frothy, white head. Lovely aroma of tropical citrus awesomeness. The flavor delivers on the promise of the scent. Truly delicious. A top notch example of the wonders of the Mosaic hop varietal."
Poured into a teku pint. Label says 05/27/16.
Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter. 
Cloudy pale orange hue with light thin head and solid lacing
Tap at armsby
"Very floral on the nose. Taste follows suit with the honey sweetness (but not much, perfect amount) coming thru about 2/3 the way in. As it warms it gains complexity. You get more tropical notes at that point. Low bitterness and perhaps the slightest bit of alcohol taste. This is a very nice addition to Trillium's repertoire. Get u some!"
"Let's just start with wow! Nice pour and color, floral nose that turns to tropical as the beer warms. Absolutely knocks it out of the park with the flavor -- several subtle tastes going on that really meld well -- none of them dominant -- a little citrus, tropical fruits, hint of the honey but with a dryness that suggests certain Tripels to me. An incredible balance of all these flavors. Just enough bitterness. Really outstanding. Super soft mouthfeel. Bottom line -- definitly world class. I want more. Let me say it again -- wow!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a huge sudsy white head that sticks around forever. This is the least cloudy Trillium beer I've seen. There are thick, sticky, hanging sheets of lacing. The smell on this is unbelievable!! Citrus is the star, most notably grapefruit and tangerine, also some peach. There are strong notes of an earthy dankness as well as some sweet floral notes. The taste is the same, although slightly less amazing because the hop notes aren't as individually pronounced as in the smell, but instead an amazing cornucopia of flavors. The feel is medium and very smooth with a lightly bitter and sticky yet dry finish. Overall this beer is amazing. Up there with the best I have ever had from Trillium. Must admit I was slightly skeptical as the only other DIPA I've had brewed with honey is Hopslam, and that is a hot mess, but this beer was so elegantly and masterfully executed I am almost at a loss for words."
"Been after this one for a while now, and I have to say I am totally blown away. The mosaic hops and the raw honey are a perfect match. The nose is very similar to a lot of their other ipa's, but the taste is what really sets this one apart, especially as it warms a little. The tropical/stone fruit flavors gradually give way to more dankness and a lingering floral note that is undoubtedly from the honey. Highly complex, absolutely delicious, and a joy to drink. For me, this is just about as close to perfection as you can get."
"Pours a foggy golden orange color with a decent sized bubbly white head. Leaves some spotty lacing around the glass, but not much."
Fantastic!
750ml bottle dated 05/27/16
"Yellowish gold with a typical white head. Not as hazy as some of their other IPAs, you can see your fingers on the other side of the glass."
"L - almost syrupy looking orange, very glossy and deep. different than the usual haze trillium provides but very nice looking."
Straw to pale gold in color and clear with little head.
"A unique offering in the IIPA family. Pours out translucent, orange-juice haze. Smells like flowers and grape must. Flavor is juice juice juice with wildflower honey sweetness, citrus perk, and a bit of white-grape. Sweet, fluffy biscuit mouthfeel. Amazing."
"Artaic is fantastic. I had heard this batch was subpar, but I really think the hazy juice bombs have just made this beer less interesting to a lot of people. "
"Just an amazing IPA. Great hop flavors, mild honey. One of their best."
"Big thanks to SeannieK91 for the trade. Bottled 02/25/2016. Pours a bright golden orange with a translucent hue and a pillowy half-inch, bright white head that gradually recedes towards the edges leaving a soapy slick across the surface. Great juicy nose on this beer - apricots, mango, a kiss of honey and a trace of something herbal/vegetal towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are less prominent than suggested by the nose and there's also a crackery quality to the malt profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) albeit a bit thin, with a mild, even carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, very drinkable but not sure it lives up to a 99."
"Consumed three weeks after bottling. Golden pour with light carbonation and a moderate head. Aroma of citrus, bready malt, light floral notes and alcohol. Taste of orange rind, pineapple, grapefruit, honey and tea. Great beer that I definitely enjoyed but less so than their usual DIPAs. Hard to see why people either love or loathe this beer - opinion seems to run the entire spectrum - when it's neither incredible nor average. My guess is that it's a great beer that's judged against expectations driven by scarcity and previous releases. Surprised by the 100 rating and also how it dipped from 100 to 99 after the last release."
This was awful. Got an infected bottle I believe. Tasted like onions and garlic. I was looking forward to having the best rated Trillium beer. Turned out to be terrible. Complete drain pour. Video posted online.
Bottle poured into a snifter.
"Probably one of Trillium's very best beers. This one hits all notes that a good IPA should be. Really fruity and floral while not being overbearing with bitterness. It does bite, but it's super fresh, clean, and crisp."
"From a bottle from 2/25/16. The smell is strong and dank, not as bright or floral as I expected. The color is good, but not very hazy. The taste is rich and I taste more garlic flavor than onion. Overall it's a fantastic beer, but not as good as I was expecting."
Bottle date : 2/24/16 
"Pure onions and garlic. I don't understand what went wrong with trillium and this latest batch. Whether it was scaling it up to a new system, or ingredients this is not the beer that was rated so highly. I will seek at the next batch to hope this was a fluke"
Tastes like liquid cannabis with some sweetness. The garlic and onion come through a bit that I normally get from insanely hopped Mosaic brews. Delicious.
"This batch must be off, but still a great IPA. Really giving off some west coast vibes. Doesn't have that Trillium flare, and is lacking the creamy mouthfeel of the New England IPAs I love. Much more clear than most in the NE style. In any case, pretty delicious. I'd describe it as Enjoy By, but a bit more refined and with less sweetness. Happy to slurp this down, but will have to try again when they make a batch like the original. A bit disappointing, but overall an excellent beer."
"A pale yellow brew with a modest white head and just a touch of haziness. The aroma is incredible, the only thing I can compare it to is Pieces of 8 by Foley Brothers. It's one of the most complex aromas I've come across with dankness that's complemented by citrus and tropical notes. The taste is somewhat subdued, but is still juicy and introduces notes of white grapes, stone fruit, pineapple and just a hint of juniper or spruce. The feel is fantastic, despite being thin. So soft and well carbonated. I wish I could compare this to other Trillium beers, but I can't. That said, this is an amazing beer and I totally get the hype. I agree with some reviews that said it was thin, but that barely detracts from the excellence of this beer. I am super impressed."
"Ok so my only conclusion was that this entire batch was off, smells like garlic and onions, looks thin, thin mouthfeel, no haze at all tastes like a watered down mosaic single ipa, not what I was expecting at all. By far the worst of the 10 beers I've tried from trillium, I assume they will figure it out and the next batch will be great again, but this was a huge disappointment. Updated 6/30, new batch much better, updated rating. That last batch definitely was off, glad to taste the real thing."
"As Trillium's number one offering, I honestly found this one to be a bit underwhelming. While it certainly embodies the characteristics of a solid DIPA, I just assumed it would boast ""more."" Where is the traditional haze one can expect to find in a NE beer? Where is the creamy mouthfeel that I am accustomed to from these guys? Great aromas and above average taste; definitely worth trying. But I am perfectly content drinking the less hyped offerings from Trillium."
Damn this is a great brew! Slamming Mosaic hops. Great flavor and very drinkable.
"I was absolutely ready to be BLOWN AWAY by this beer, as the other Trillium beers I've had were righteous. I was shocked to see the beer was not the MEGA-haze juice-bomb Trillium look that I've come to admire, but more of a light haze and golden yellow color. The nose was what I expected, and the taste was floral, tropical fruit, some sweetness and a slight hop bitterness. The beer is an absolute SNIPER, as I detected ZERO alcohol and polished off the bottle with the quickness of a session, only to be reminded that it's actually 8% ABV. In summary, very nice beer, but I'll take the DDH stuff all day..."
"Based on the ratings, I was expecting this to be one of the best Trillium beers. However, I believe this is below par as far as Trillium beers go. It lacks the signature Trillium haze. Congress St., Vicinity, Fort Point and any DDH blow this out the water. Hard to believe this is over 8%, you'd never be able to guess it was that high."
"Growler poured into a tulip. From 2/26/16 first release out of Canton, MA"
Poured from the bottle into a mason jar.
Man I am going to be hated for this review but ...
Having this fresh a day after release. Super unique beer. Could be just me but I get a ton of onion and garlic off the nose. In a good way though. Honey is there on the finish for sure. Its smooth as hell - no alcohol at all. Really interesting and fantastic. Worth waiting in the line.
"my favorite offering from Trillium. Aroma of melon and tropical fruit typical of trillium but just way more intense than any of their other beers i have had. Taste followed the nose and explodes with sweet tropical fruit that stays steady throughout each sip, real light hop bitterness tries to sneak through on the back but is subdued by the fruit. really glad i grabbed this definitely a top DIPA"
From November 2015 - Just now writing about it. Another fantastic citrus delight from Trillium.
"Probably my favorite dipa I had in 2015. Trillium has got it going on when it comes to hops. Mouth feel on this is creamy and coats the mouth like no other hoppy beer I've ever had. Hazy as you would expect trillium beers to be, lots of citrus, orange, tangerine, mango, papaya, good malt backbone but not overpowering. This is just such a crisp juicy and floral IPA."
Very good one of my favorites
"Another great offering from Trillium. A pale coppery golden pour with a thin but lasting head. A big hop nose of peach and tangerine. A very original flavor including tangerine, nectarine, and mandarin orange. Thick and dank flavor, but with a smooth drinkability and mild bitter finish. The carbonation seems a bit low, and it seems flat as it warms, but it is so good it seems inconsequential."
"750 ml bottle. Pours deep apricot color with finger white head, fades to thin layer, spotty lace. Dark ripe fruit n citrus aroma. Taste follows with ripe plum, peach, orange juiciness, caramel sweetness. Some dankness lasts into the dry finish. Ultra soft medium mouthfeel. Another great DIPA by Trillium,"
"What to say. Even a 3+ week old bottle is magnificent. Clean, floral, fruity and the right amount of sweet with absolutely no alcohol. The honey is more pronounced with a few weeks on the bottle but this beer is just about perfect."
"Was lucky enough to have it head to head vs Dinner, Heady Topper, Speed Mettle, Haze, Epiphany and Freak of Nature."
"Another hyped Trillum, no big thing right? I couldn't be more wrong. This is hands down the best bottled dipa, I've had, and I've only had a couple drafts that have this beat. Its amazing how floral danky it is, while at the same time the sweetness of the honey comes through. This is about as good as it gets."
"Another world class offering by Trillium, I love the nose on this beer. Super smooth double IPA with a sweet hint of honey on the back end. Can't wait till this gets released again."
750mL bottled 11/19 poured into a tulip and enjoyed on 12/3
"32 oz growler, pale clear golden color unlike many of the more turbid Trillium offerings. Juicy tropical DIPA with a smooth honey finish. Not too sweet and not syrupy. Hides its abv very well, super drinkable and very unique. The subtle balance of the hops and honey make this a special brew...."
"I've gotta say I absolutely loved this beer when I had it in Late 2015. But when the follow up batch came out in Feb. 2016, well, it couldn't have been more of an 180 turn for me, and I couldn't be more disappointed as this release was highly anticipated for me- all I gotta say is the taste follows the nose. And the nose is all Onion. But my friends loved it"
A few weeks old so would have higher expectations on fresh
"Poured into tulip from 32 oz. growler purchased yesterday. Pours nice golden honey color with fluffy white head. Floral, grass, tangerine smells. Taste starts with tangerine, honey dew melon, white wine and finishes with honey. This beer has a nice sticky mouth feel. This beer is a pretty unique combination of bright smells and taste with more earthy, sticky tastes and feel on the back end."
Bottled Nov 19 Enjoyed on the 21st very fresh and a great beer 
Service: Bottle
Id have a hard time picking a favorite between this and Headroom when it comes to Trillium DIPAS. Just phenomenal.
Amazing IPA
"Bottled 9/3 and consumed on 11/14, so not exactly fresh. Pours a golden hue that is hazy in the glass. Great hop aroma, overly bitter finish. I think this would be a lot smoother and not as harsh if fresh."
L - Candlelit orange. Glowing and hazy. 
"A bit on the sweet side for me, courtesy of that honey; but still one very solid DIPA. It didn't quite wow me on the same level that their Galaxy Fort Point did, but that doesn't mean it didn't leave me wanting more. Can't wait to try another from these guys!"
"A: Pours a dark, almost murky honey color with a half finger cream colored head. Leaves some nice spotty lacing down the glass with each sip."
My favorite by trills so far!
"Another treat from Jason, poured into me Teku glass shows almost a orange reddish copper color with a foamy off-white head. Smells like a sweet floral, herbacious with some tangerine. Taste is similar with a little white grape, dry sweetness, very gentle resin finish. Feel is smooth and light. Overall another good beer from Trill, little sweet and more malt flavors than I have come to expect from them."
"Thank you, Kevin. Cloudy orange pour with a thick white head. Outrageous citrus aroma which heightens the anticipation of the first sip. A remarkable balance of bitter pine, juicy citrus and sweet malt. The honey is totally subdued; if I didn't see it on the label, I wouldn't have known it was in there. Good mouthfeel and a sweet bready finish. World class. Bravo, Trillium."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Treehouse tulip glass. Thank you Steve for picking this up, you da man."
"Way too sweet for me. Taste a lot of mosaic too, which isn't appealing with the honey. A lot of people love it. For me, not one of Trillium's better hoppy beers."
"Is there an option for a 6? or even a 10? I can't get enough of this beer. So juicy it's mindblowing. Perfect amount of lacy white head, cloudy and orange-y golden, the smell is faintly hoppy, but mostly an explosion of fruit, the Taste follows pretty closely with these pretty awesome sweet notes from the honey. Hands down, undisputed favorite beer of all time across all styles. Best beer I've ever had, so cool that my home state is putting out liquid gold like this. Awesome. Trillium can do no wrong."
1400th review. Growler was poured into a snifter.
"Pours a cloudy applejuice color, with a huge, froth white head."
"This was a blind taste. I didn't know what I was drinking, but I was blown away as soon as I smelled it. The taste did not disappoint. I immediately labeled this possibly the best IPA I've ever tasted. If they made a cologne that smelled like this, I would wear it everyday."
Bottle poured into snifter. Beautiful cloudy and yellow body with a small white and frothy head. I was expecting some honey taste in this and it actually had me a little worried but it was completely undetectable so fur me that was a good thing. The aroma is pure fruit juice. Is compare this one to MBC Dinner. Super citrusy and smooth as can be. Definitely in my top 5 and I hope to get more. Trillium does spectacular IPAs.
"Surprisingly clear and orange hued for a Trillium beers. Aroma is unsurprisingly explosive, the wildflower honey leading, toners of clover and a grapey sweetness. The flavor, however, lacks a bit in depth. I don't like the syrupy boozier honey ipas but this almost becomes a touch too dry and light. Great but I would say pipeworks square grouper, surprisingly, competes well."
Loved this beer . Great cloudy beer i expect for trillium . Love mosaic hops so the nose was great . Texture with the light honey sweetness made this easy to drink .
Absolutely outstanding DIPA. No hints of booze. Mouthfeel is juicy and well rounded. Honey really balances the bitter hop finish. Huge tangerine scent and flavor. Big citrusy DIPA that is as good as any I've had.
"Finally getting around to reviewing this beer after enjoying back on 6/6/15 thanks to the help of BA Shaggy9356. Luckily I have some notes to put some details to why I loved this beer so much--maybe my favorite from Trillium. Anyhoo, I enjoyed it out of a dark brown 750 ml bottle with a bottling date of 5/19, so about two and a half weeks old. Poured into a Speigelau IPA glass."
"Wow, the smell on this one is amazing. So overpowering of mosaic ops. Pours a little less hazy then rest of their beers so far. Might be because it sat a little longer before being drank as well. Also seemed a touch maltier then others i have had from them. Could be from being not being drank within 2 weeks of bottling or that its being a little higher in abv. I would love more still though!"
Absolutely fantastic! One of the best beers to ever grace my lips. Taste's as amazing as it smells. The balance of hop bite with sweetness is sublime. Doesn't get much better than this.
Poured into a Trillium tulip.
"Highlight of the night for me! And there were some pretty big bottles opened, including: Art, Arthur, Home sour home, Sticky Hands, Sosus..."
One of the best DIPAs I have had from anyone. But I think their other IPAs are better. That just shows how much they are killing it on their regular stuff
"Poured into snifter from 25 oz bottle approximately 10 days old. Slightly cloudy golden yellow with a small white head. Smell is dominated by candied peach, with a hint of lemon. Taste is sweet, peaches and tangerine, with a very light bitterness. Nice and light feel in the mouth, but a nice a lingering oilyness. Overall this is a well crafted, incredibly balanced beer."
"A: Pours a perfect golden yellow color, nice fluffy white head, and amazing lacing down the glass. Only slight complaint from me is it pours quite clear and I love my Ipa's to be nice and unfiltered cloudyness."
750 ml bottle dated 9/3/15 poured into a tulip
"This beer is extraordinary, and probably Trillium's finest, among its many great offerings. The beer is the perfect combination of fruit and hops, and puts most Vermont breweries to shame, including Lawson's and many of Hill Farmstead's offerings."
Honey comes through in the taste right away. The honey balances the biterness of the hop and the malt leaves a clean back end. Perfection in a glass.
"Lots of fruits and hops on the aroma. Big white head on the pour. Lots of floral flavors with big fruity gulps. All around, a top notch beer to try, it seems to stay fresh! Glad I've got to meet, drink and share these guys so many times!"
Candied pineapple and peach on
"Bottle not dated but bottled on 9/3/15 I know; drank in a Teku glass on 9/6/15; amazing beer, like all other hoppy Trillium beers, but a definite addition of sweetness from the honey"
Poured from a 750ml into tulip glasses:
"Pours hazy orange with fair carbonation and a two finger head. Smell is sweet like honey and syrup, with citrus rind and floral hops. Taste is hoppy mosaic with a light refreshing honey flavor that coats the mouth. Real crisp bitterness here, but balanced enough to finish so light and flavorful. This beer is incredible. This bottle is from the second release and the staff stated it ""may be the best beer they've ever made."" Hard to confirm that since every beer Trillium makes is fantastic, but this is pretty damn impressive and certainly elite."
"Another great offering from Trillium...tropical fruit with only a hint of honey/sweetness that lets the Mosaic hops shine through. Perfect mouthfeel, consistent with the majority of other Trillium offerings I have had to date."
"Damon son this is insane!!!! I'm drinking a 2 month old Artaic and I have to say.... It is still one of the best imperial ipas I have ever had! The nose is insane - tons of sweet honey, tastes as good as it smells lots of full flavors and big body - the honey really compliments the hops and malts into a smooth rich balance of perfection... An amazing beer - please seek this out, very unique"
"This is as good as it gets. WOW such an amazing IIPA. So far this is my favorite. Dank orange color, with a good amount of foam on the pour. Smell is fruity with a whiff of mosaic hops. Taste is clean and tropical, sits on the palate very nicely and finishes with a small sample of bitterness if any at all. I could drink this all day, amazing beer by Trillium, definitely one of the best IIPAs out there so far."
"Smells and looks good, but way too much honey for me"
Look: mildy hazy like most of the IPAs i love right now; more haze the better
Dank and hoppy. Very fruity. Grapefruit and peaches. Finishes with mango and papyas. Very impressed with my first Trillium offering. This one has a nice amount of bitterness that doesn't overpower the fruit flavors. #Trillville
L: beautiful straw
This is an absolute Mosaic bomb and the best IPA that I have had from Trillium so far. This is clean and crisp with a very nice mouthfeel and an incredible Mosaic hop aroma and flavor. Wow.
"I'm a big fan of Trillium. Moved within 10 min of the place and that was not an accident. But I do have my criticisms, moving here from across the country 10 months ago -- so I do judge objectively. Honestly, if it wasn't for the honey, this would taste absolutely terrible. The honey is all the flavor. Bitterness is too much for the malt. Not up to Trillium standards. Though I'm sure they'll brew it many more times, since the downtowners don't get anything better and buy it out immediately. "
"this beer is amazing, might be the best ipa ive ever had. everything complemented so well. the hops were just bitter, tropical, and juicy enough. the honey added an awesome sweetness. more and more impressed with trillium with each bootle."
Such a good beer. Can't compare it to anything. The perfect hops mixed with honey and small fruit flavors. Easily one of my favorite ipa's.
Favorite DIPA hands down! 
Mosiac Hops burst through your taste buds. After taste of a bit of honey. If I had to compare this beer to any beer it would be Jack Abby's Kiwi Rising and Maine Brewery Beer 1
"Look: Hazy, darker, or rich orange, or even imperial orange. Yes, made up colors. Sticky, fluffy, head."
"This pours like most trillium brews, hazy and murky with a large white head that settles to a small film. Flavor and taste are full of tropical fruits, pineapple and mango come to mind. The honey lends a full body and mild sweetness that is sublime."
Sweaty gym socks and onions...But in a good way
The honey adds a complex mix to this IPA.
"750ml bottle, served in a stemmed glass."
"Two bottles, same bottling date, same trade."
Awesome beer. So smooth. Highlights the hops perfectly. Seek this one out!
Another home run from Trillium.
maybe the best hoppy beer ever? perfect mouthfeel in all 4 bottles I have had- the nose is outstanding- perfect amount of honey- I wouldnt change one thing about this beer.
"This beer smells awesome, similar to some of the best from Lawson's or Tree House. Taste is signature Trillium with the nice addition of honey. Perhaps the best honey IPA I have ever had, but not quite Top 10 material in the world of great New England IPA's."
Wow. JUST WOW. Pours a cloudy yellow with hazy color. Smells of a citrus bomb and the honey. Perfect taste with a balance between the sweetness of the honey and the taste of the hops. Juicy and fruity with about every tropical fruit taste imaginable. Great mouth feel with the perfect amount of carbonation. A perfect beer to me. One of my top 5 IPAS ever.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass on 05/19/15. 
"After letting it sit the weekend, the honey absolutely comes out to play."
"Very sweet, creamy, borders on cloying...next to no bitterness to even things out. Smells great but what's here, in my opinion, is not where this beer rates. A fine beer, but not a world class DIPA. Somewhat confounded by the lovefest."
Very similar to Vicinity. What can I say that hasn't been said? This is my perfect beer.
"051915. Gorgeous beer. Color, head, haze. Massive bouquet of hops with incredible amounts of tropical fruit. A word I can't help but use is ""rich."" It's almost too intense. Floral, fruity, piney. Hop oils are out of control. You get some floral wildflower honey, too. So damn smooth, creamy, hoppy. Never cloying or overly bitter. Perfect balanced and way too drinkable. Not sure what else to say. I would rather keep drinking it. Just bummed that it's a 750ml and not 2L or more. Wow. Yes, it's this good and if there is hype in the future, it's worth it. This is everything that every Double IPA should be. Cheers, Trillium! And massive thanks go to judkinst for snagging a bottle for me!"
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
Smells like a glass of tropical punch. Nice color and great taste. The alcohol is hidden nicely. Will definately have again!
"this beer has the typical profile of a Trillium double IPA, but has an amazing honey like sweetness to it. Similar to Square Grouper, but with more citrus to it. Amazing"
Bomber poured into an antique German pilsener glass.
"This is the direction IPAs need to take. This is one of the premier hoppy beers that is just tasty with such a large inviting nose it's hard to say nose. A little too bitter on the finish, but still one of the best IPAs I've had."
"I am pretty sure it doesn't get better than this, although I am sure Trillium will make another beer that is better."
Needs to be a 5+ for the nose on this thing!
One of the best Double IPA's I've tasted - great floral aroma from the mosaic hops and wildflower honey. Who knew honey would pair that well with an IPA. 
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Honey really gives this beer some body, but I found it overwhelming. Not enough balance - I don't think I'd drink this one again."
"Hazy straw yellow with a creamy head and lots of lace. Dank tropical fruit aroma. Flavors of tangerine, grapefruit, mango. Bitter grassy finish. Delicious chewy beer."
"This beer was a true pleasure. The pantheon of ipa/iipa. The nose is outstanding and matches perfectly with the taste. Taste is juicy, hoppy, with a perfect balance of honey and dry malt to keep it balanced. The mouthfeel is fluffy and full, but very refreshing as well."
Trill setting a new bar for hop juciness. Amazing Mosaic DIPA...gorgeous hazy golden color in the VT DIPA style. Soft juicy/tropical flavor w a clean/dry finish. Just an amazing brew...seek this out
This is a wow beer. Pours a beautiful sun yellow. Smells of mango and passionfruit. Taste is amazing citrus. Pineapple mango grapefruit and then a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is substantial. I want to chew it. Absolutely outstanding.
"Bottle. Great artwork as always. Pours the signature Trillium hazy, murky but bright yellow orange. Lots of frothy, sticky lacing. Pungent, damp Mosaic hoppiness. The epitome of Mosaic hops. Grass, onion, plump citrus cornucopia, moss, guava, melon, papaya. Stemmy honeysuckle. Pastry malt sweetness. Flavor is very reminiscent of many other Trillium hop-bombs. It's like sucking on a mouthful of hop pellets. Dank and tropical Mosaic. Lots of sugary sweetness in both malt and honey. Doesn't blind you with bitterness. Honey seems to add a very full mouthfeel; or maybe it's the extra supporting malt. Finishes with a flavor of Mosaic hop extract. If you like the hop varietal you will fall in love with Artaic. It's another very Trillium-esque hop potion. They have a very distinct style of hoppy beer. Will continue to support these guys over in Fort Point."
"The nose is absolutely outstanding with citrus, fruity and floral playing back and forth at any given moment. The taste is just delicious with a very light bitterness and great honey malt. This is a fantastic beer."
One of the best hoppy beers I've had. Well done.
"This beer is very similar on the nose and tongue. In both the pine accent from the mosaic hops and the raw wildflower honey are present, but not overbearing. These flavors are blended to perfection. Great beer!"
Golden orange in color. Cloudy in appearance. This smells like no other ipa I've ever had. Huge tangerine and citrus rind. This is extremely close to Ephraim. Juicy as hell. Really good.
Huge nose and matching flavor. Honey and mosaic work perfectly. One of the best. Hands down.
"Honey is incorporated well, not overpowering at all. Doesn't drink like your usual double ipa... mosaic hops give a citrus finish. Another great choice from trillium"
"Another BIG beer by Trillium, I sound like a broken record. The honey is apparent in both the aroma and taste. In fact it's a cloudy, golden honey like color in appearance. Thick, white foamy head that seems to dissipate slowly. Pine like hops combined with a smooth, honey finish. The hops seem to burst mid sip as well. Honey O' Hops…this is another winner!! Beautiful crisp, smooth mouthfeel, hops are prickly to the tongue. Medium amount of carbonation. The honey really gives it a nice balance."
"Pot, papaya, mango, melon, candied peach from beginning to middle. Cakey finish with a bit of mild grapefruit. Perfect mouth feel."
"11/6/18 canning of this 10.5% abv imperial oat cream IPA, which, in Other Half lingo, means it is brewed with oats and lactose... This beer features Citra and Citra cryo hops - presumably triple dry-hopped... Looks like a glass of orange juice with some foam on top... Packs a huge citrus character - very sharp and tangy - impressions of orange abound, with additional edge provided courtesy of lime and grapefruit notes... The body and profile is rounded off with deeper tropical elements such as mango and its green, unripe skin... Medium-full body is relatively smooth, but any softness is offset by the sharp edge of citric acid... Moderately sweet, mildly bitter... Not necessarily a favorite of mine, but I am hard-to-please when it comes to orange and sharp citrus - in a NEIPA, I'd rather something a little more ""gentle"" lol... Still, not something fans of the style or brewer should pass up..."
"A: massive mandarin orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango. Loads of Fresh fruit. "
Can. White heads hazy dull gold. This is straight up pineapple orange juice. Tropical melon and mango. Very soft. Incredible drinkability. Does not taste anywhere near 10.5%. Wow.
"Pours hazy orange. Foamy, thick, tall white head that Fades slowly with lacing."
16 ounce can dated 9/12/18. Poured into Lexan tulip. 
Pours a murky golden yellow with a thin white cap.
Poured into a 12oz snifter glass via draft at Other Half
Welcome to act four of New @CanConPhilly Beer Sunday (Week 709)! It is like a Shakespearean tragedy & things are now at a climax. 
"Super cloudy, somewhat murky yellow with two fingers of off-white head. Soapy lacing."
Yup! Uber delicious
"All I can say is this is a great beer. Very orange-creamy, with some sweetness. It’s a lot like a milder version of Permuation 40, Trilliums creamsicle beer. It had a better balance of sweet and hope bite. Really good, another beer I can’t believe is so high in ABV."
Can thanks to swedes21
Tall can...5/30/18...
"So good. A little sweeter than the ddh ace which i prefer, but for a 10%er, this is a master class in hidden abv and smoothness. a top notch triple ipa."
"16 oz can, dated 5/30/18, poured into a teku"
"Crazy smooth at 10.5, this beer is fire"
"Acquired on release day (6/2/18), poured into snifter. Medium foam head that builds nicely; bright orange in color. Pure pineapple juice, with regular tropical notes. Very sugary and sweet, heavy but extremely enjoyable. The pineapple really hit me in the face."
Liquid orange juice
Smooth tasty. Kicks ass
"Poured a cloudy yellow body with good head and lace sheath. Aroma has grapefruit and some light tropical fruit smells with little else. Smooth, clean, light body, there is a touch of floral crispness that keeps beer from cloying as beer is mostly a sweet, fruit beer. Finishes crisp/dry with well-hidden ABV."
Perfectly balanced and delicious!!
Solid. Balanced. Crusher
Perfect smooth double IPA not too heavy but full of flavor
This beer is the SHIT!! Hell Yes!!! 100% recommend!
Light & smooth for an IPA. Easy to drink! With an added slight fruity taste! Highly recommended!
"Very smooth great tasting double ipa, can’t even tell it’s a double. Pretty color and good smell. Would recommend to another."
Simply delicious!
Does NOT taste like what double IPA would typically taste like. Very smooth and full flavored with out the bite! Great after taste also
One of the best Double IPA’s I’ve ever had. I hope The Virginia Beer Company makes this every year!!
"So, the beer pours a rich looking, apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose, there's a huge aroma of mango, papaya, apricot and pineapple. The mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was also a bit less full than I was expecting, though I appreciate the fairly light, dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer. The finish is very clean in this beer, and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. So drinkability is pretty good. This is a very good DIPA for sure, though I don't think it quite matches up with the #7 version I tried last night. However, I think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this DIPA immensely. "
Look is a hazy orange color with a small off white head that is sort of thin and leaves quickly. Decent lacing.
Subtle and refreshing.
From howler (less than 2 weeks).
A-Pours a hazy thick orange color with a nice head and lacing
12 oz. Can. Canned 5/22/18 opened on 6/1/18 ss#6
Cloudy straw color with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a prominent grapefruit aroma. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit taste with a little touch of hops. Nice blend
Excellent Double IPA in a 12 oz can.
"Pours a light grapefruit color, gentle haze throughout. Nice foamy head that lingers. Big citrus bomb. Load of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, orange, some grassiness. Taste follows nose: sweet pineapple, grapefruit pith, lemon zest, fresh squeezed Valencia orange juice. Wow. Very nice. Carbonation is on point. Overall this is a very enjoyable DIPA. Not too heavy, not very malty, NE style, VERY juicy, not dank. Outstanding."
These guys shit excellence
Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew.
This beer out-tree houses Tree House. It was like a pineapple jumped out of the can when I popped it and punched me in the nose. Abner was my first great love by this brewer but I've discovered another. THIS is why I love beer.
"Look: very hazy, bright orange/yellow appearence, white head with plenty of lacing"
Look: Yellow hazy with big fluffy white head. Has medium low carbonation.
A beer that competes well with Treehouse Brewing! Well done!
"Nearly 100% opaque dark yellow with a very large, dense off-white foam slowly settling to a lumpy uneven blanket leaving tons of fuzzy, coral-like lace."
"Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass, about two weeks old. Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with one finger thick head (decent retention). The hop aroma is very good with classic Mosaic notes: blueberry, citrus (orange and grapefruit), and onion/earthy notes. There is also a good amount of pine, resin, bubblegum, honeysuckle, and fermented sugar. "
Poured from the can a very hazy golden orange color with just under a fingers worth of white foamy head. The smell bursts from the can and intensifies as you pour hitting you with tons of tropical fruit and floral notes. The flavor starts juicy before finishing off with a decent pine bitterness. The feel is soft and finished dry. This is another stellar DIPA from Hill Farmstead. Is there anything they make that isn't great?!
Multipe cans picked up and consumed within two weeks. Cans! Still blows my mind. 
On tap at Doc Ponds.
Appearance: Arrives hazy and amber colored with a nice head that leaves some strands of lace
"Poured from a 750ml growler, 3 days old. Pours a hazy orange color. The nose id loaded with tropic flavors. Like the nose, the taste is pineapple, mango, orange. A creamy thick mouthfeel, this is a world class IPA"
750ml swing top poured into a tulip glass filled on7/29
"One of my favorite IPAs. Love the mosaic! Appearance is a cloudy-mango-juice look. Aromas of dank stone/tropical fruits like peach, mango, pineapple, papaya with a sweet bready backbone. Taste is a dank, bready, tangerine-mango. As usual, the pillow-soft mouthfeel that is characteristic of HF is here also. Great offering as is all the other ""Double"" IPAs of Hill Farmstead. Will be eager to lan this mosaic bomb again when it gets re-released!"
"had this in a growler poured 2 days ago. subtle fruity notes with the scent. beautiful haze on the pour. wish there was a little more carbonation in the mouth feel, but this is a pretty amazing brew."
Very tasty brew here. Reminds me of a Trillium DIPA which is high praise from me. So smooth and well balanced and bursting with flavor. One of my favorite brews from HF. Well done
"This one pours a slightly hazy bright orange, with a small white head, and a good amount of lacing. It was poured on tap in Albany, NY at City Beer Hall."
Great hazy golden color
"Poured into a tulip from a growler. A bit flat, as it was filled a week ago, but still with decent carb and a small head that left laces. Hazy but not turbid and an acorn squash color. Bright aromas of blueberry, pine, and herbal notes. The taste was as billed with prominent blueberry and stone fruit. Also a nice dank undercurrent with a restrained bready malt presence. The bitterness is there but slowly builds to the finish. Alcohol is well-hidden. One of the softest, fruitiest DIPAs I've had."
On tap at Armsby Abbey
had on tap at the archives in burlington and subsequently in cans.
Poured from a 2 day old growler into a stemmed goblet.
"Not a bad DIPA by any means, but compared to others from the S&S series that I have had, this one just didn't stand out as much. I'd be more than happy to give it a second chance though..."
On tap at Three Penny. 
"Great stuff, taste was a little bitingly sweet on the finish but not enough to really detract from it."
On tap at armsby abbey on 5-13.
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a pint glass. Best by 12May16, growler filled 5 days ago. "
Poured from the growler one day after fill at the brewery.
"Awesome beer. Had it on tap at Armsby Abbey. Look, Smell, Taste, Feel all on point. Lots of tropical notes balanced with a hoppy bite. Think I might grab another while I'm here."
L: Healthy guava and muted honeycomb hues with an ample white head and insane lacing
"Growler from the brewery, it pours cloudy gold color which had a 1+ finger foamy bright white head that was full of bubbles and dissipated very slowly, leaving excellent foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down."
Pours a golden hue with white head. It smells incredible. There are many ways I've described how this tastes:
Typical mosaic hops. However the single hop mosaic APA is better than this beer. Still good but not the best of the SS lineup.
"Pours hazy orange with a one finger head. Smells of oranges and tropical fruits. The taste is citrus, bitter and crisp. Hoppy with peppery notes. Awesome contribution to the S&S series. Really enjoyed this one."
"This is one of the best uses of mosaic hops I've experienced. The nose is big and bold with notes of florals, herbs, grapefruit peel and pine. Lots of citrus bursting out in the flavor. Body is so on point and its very drinkable. Overall another world-class HF beer."
Growler drank in a chalice on 3/27/2016
"Went to the brewery and had a few different beers and this one was my second favorite after the little bit of Ann that I tasted. The beer has nice head that diminishes quickly. The smell is all mosaic. Citrus/orange, a little dank and a little grassy. Taste is more citrus followed by some earthy grassy flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, easy drinking like all HF Beers. I liked this one more than S&S #5 which surprised me because as much as I like Mosaic hops, I like Citra even more. Yet, the Mosaic IPA was the clear winner for its more intense flavor."
"wow that's good. I love mosaic, it's my favorite hop and this beer...THIS beer...this is fantastic. can't believe 8.1 abv drinks much lighter. great beer. worth hunting down."
White head with lace. Hazy golden orange. 
"This is in my opinion the best of the S&S Series. So far I have been lucky enough to get growlers of 1, 3, 5, 6 & 7 and I think that 6 was the best overall with 5 a close second."
"Thanks to @walderek for this growler. You are too kind, Sir."
"On tap. Nice cloudy mix of oj and grapefruit juice. Great lacing. Retention is only downfall. Great smell. Medley of citrus. Fresh peel. Absolute mosaic bomb. This is the type of beer that made me fall in love with the hop. Super juicy. Grapefruit, touch of lime, hint of mango. Rocks the bitter. Another great creamy feel from the HF folks. Bit of stick and juice. Perfect. Great, great beer."
"Pours a golden orange color with a medium white head that dissipates. Nice lacing on the glass. Smell is hoppy and pungent with some grassy tones. Taste reflects the same, nice earthy, grassy flavor. Feel is super smooth consistent with their other IPAs. Outstanding"
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery. 
Generally not a fan of mosaic hops but this is one easy drinking SOB.
"My notes below are truncated; I'm having this beer as part of a bottle share. Reviewed live at low altitude in Austin, TX. Expectations are sky-high; this is my first Hill Farmstead beer. Best consumed by: 01/21/15. "
A-hazy golden yellow color with a nice white head and good lacing
"Split with Goblinmunkey7, growler filled about 7 hours ago"
Split with angrybabboon.
"Quite possibly the best beer I have ever had. Reminiscent of all the best elements of Double Sunshine, Focal Banger, and King Sue. The ultimate expression of proper dank and seductive citrus hops. From the nose, to the tip of the tongue, to the mid palate and aftertaste, perfect in every way. A compellingly lascivious masterpiece!!!"
Incredible. A bit more juicy and fruity than Double Citra.
"Bright yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Bursting with pineapple, orange, grapefruit and papaya. Cracker malt base helps elevate the hop flavors. Creamy feel, dry and short finish. Balanced bitterness."
Smell of graprefruit. Taste of citrus followed by a smooth and long bitterness.
Growler: Poured a hazy blonde color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of tropical fruit is quite powerful with some nice apricot notes. Taste is also dominated by some huge notes of tropical fruit with some nice apricot notes with also some nice citrus notes. Body is full enough for style with good carbonation. Dominant floral hoppy notes makes for this a great treat.
Thanks to iguenard for this
The beer comes in a beautifully hazy golden yellow.
"SS6 fill from a few days ago poured cold. Soapy white head with less lace than hill farm usual. Smells upfront if the mosaic piney, floral, hoppy. Taste is on point with upfront earthy pine needles, floral notes and a smooth coating malt profile. Mouthfeel creamy but semi bitter and dry"
"Hill Farmstead Brewery - Society & Solitude #6, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass."
SS 6
"Growler filled 3-5, consumed on 3-6. Nice bubbly one finger head sits ontop a murky orange glow. It's a great color, with wonderful lacing on the glass, as well. The aroma is so juicy and tropical. Pineapple is the major one I'm getting, with citrus and maybe some passion fruit. It's so great. The smell is a little sweet, can't detect any bitterness yet. It Tastes just like I would expect. Sweetness upfront with some pineapple juice qualities. There are other flavors in there that don't let the pineapple sweetness overwhelm. Almost no bitterness. S&S 5 was great when I had it last time, couldn't imagine this would be better. So bummed I only have one growler. The mouthfeel is creamy and the sweetness lingers for a while, it's very smooth. The alcohol is barely there. The only reason It doesn't get a 5 for mouthfeel is because it's not heady topper quality mouthfeel, which is a 5. HT is so resinous. If you like super juicy DIPA's I can't recommend this enough."
Poured from a 750 mL growler in to a HF stemmed tulip. The beer was obtained 3/01/2014 from the brewery and consumed on 3/02. 
"Pour looks like most HF IPA's, hazed bright yellow with small amount of tight white head. Nose is hop forward with faint malt balance and a hint of grain. Hops are tropical, grapefruit and mango with a touch of pine and herbal hops. Taste is more tropical fruit forward. Bright hops, mango and pear with a faint touch of herbal grassy hop through the finish. Bitterness is very light, mild carbonation with a medium to light body and juicy feel."
"This beer is simply gorgeous. Solid, one finger, pure as snow white head. Thick, cloudy, opaque liquid. Dark, pulpy orange interior, lightening to almost lemon yellow on the edges. Good head retention and beautiful lacing."
Simply one of the best IPA I've ever tasted...enjoyed this more than Abner and that's saying something
From 02/19/14 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing this one; thanks Ross! I loved S&S #'s 4 and 5 so was very excited for this one. 32 oz. growler into a Bell's tulip.
750ml growler poured into a Alchemist stemless glass.
"750ml growler filled today, 2/12/2014. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass today, 2/12/2014. So about 5 hours old..."
"Growler shared among many, poured into a taster. The brew appears a hazed yellow color with a white head that holds decent and collapses leaving a wall of lacing effect."
"On tap at HF third anniversary, Pours a hazy golden with thick fluffy head. Aroma has some classic HF dank and resin to it but is mostly tropical fruits forward. Lots of pinneaples, oranges, peaches, etc. Taste is also along those lines with a distinctive citrus acidity to balance the grassy bitterness. Full bodied and highly drinkable."
New rating and review from a 12 oz. can poured on 10-31-2017
A: Poured a hazy dark yellow with a nice white foamy head leaving behind some spotty lacing and a nice white collar. 
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with touches of gold and a nice fluffy white, two-fingers- width head that stick around and leaves a sticky fat lacing on the glass. The beer’s body is an opaque haze and appears to be free of carbonation bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells pungently of sweet and juicy tropical fruit. Mango, pineapple, touches of grapefruit, tangerine, and even touches of nectarine run across the nose and are backed up with a strong shivering pine resin and a slight caramelly bread malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then nicely bitter with a wonderful round feeling that doesn’t wrack the mouth, but does give it a proper tingle. There is also a slight pucker from acidity in this beer. The flavors begin as light and then grow, sweet tropical fruit juice flavors work from pineapple juice into orange and grapefruit flavors and then explode with bitter sticky pine in the mouth. Juicy fruit flavors also run across the palate during the sip. The finish is bitter and a touch medicinal, but thirst quenching and tasty, and the aftertaste shows the light bready malt background of the beer. In the mouth the beer feels medium light in body, and fluffy soft from the carbonation with only a touch of a prickle on the sides of the tongue. This beer also gives a proper thirst quenching snap to the mouth, which is lovely. The mouth is left dry on top and wet on the sides from the slight acidity. Overall, this is a lovely tropical fruit DIPA and a nice introduction to the mosaic hop for me. That this is a single hop beer really shows both the skill of the brewer and the wonder of this new hop variety. This beer is excellent, and you should try it."
Cheapbeerbuzz shared this one. Thanks!

On-tap at my favorite Chicago drinking hole. Served in a tulip.
"2L growler generously handed off by chuckycheese, thanks again man! Poured into HF stemware. "
Growler to hfs sniffer
64oz growler poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
750ml Growler picked up at the brewery two days ago. Pours a nice lightly hazy orange and capped by a bit of white sticky head. 
"Bottle shared thanks to raveskdr, thanks Chris!"
thanks to ILOVESTOUTS for this one
Massive thanks to cfrances33 for sending this one my way! Split with mnphish and icecoldphatty:
"Fluffy white head with a solid body on top of a cloudy, tawny-gold ale. Aroma filled with overripe pineapple, juicy yet pungent. Cracker-like dry malt aroma underneath."
"On tap many places during last week’s trip to Vermont, but the first glass was on tap at the source. Nose releases a beautiful bouquet of orange peel, faint tropical notes, and a bit of pine. Mosaic is apparently a winner. Flavor is quite fruity yet also very bitter. Mouthfeel is near perfection, as is almost always the case with HF hoppy offerings. Supremely drinkable. One of my favorite HF IPAs yet."
Growler generously shared at the Peg's tasting on 3/8/13.
Poured from a growler into a pint
750 mL growler. Thanks so much to Thorpe for getting this for me.
Served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead tulip. I've never had a beer that uses Mosaic hops (that I know of) so this is quite exciting for me. This isn't my favorite IPA but it is solid and has some great hop character.
On-tap in my kitchen. 
This is the first Society & Solitude I've had so I am unable to compare which I feel is a good thing. A lot of people's reviews get hindered by a past recipe or ingredients and it isn't fair to the current version. I had this lovely at Prohibition Pig on tap.
750ml HF swing-top growler poured into HF stemmed glass. Review copied from notes since my computer wasn't working when I drank this. First sampled at the brewery and then entire growler consumed the next day.
"This poured out as a slightly hazy yellow color with a very nice white head on top. The retention is solid and the lacing is sticky. The smell of the beer has a very nice floral fruity citrus aroma, some subtle malt on the nose also. The taste of the beer is very good, plenty of fresh hop flavors and sweet malt. Fruity citrus and melon flavors cover the taste buds. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a soft carbonation, it's a very drinkable beer. Overall it's a excellent IPA. Well worth seeking out."
"On-tap at the Blackback on 3/2/2013. Served in a Hill Farmstead Tulip. Pours a golden-orange with a loose, off-white head that dissipates into a soapy skim. Nose reveals citrus notes, rind, earthiness and juicy tropical, fruity esters as the brew warms. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also some bittering and a slightly medicinal quality to the flavor profile that peaks out towards the middle and back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and a kiss of astringency. Overall, extremely drinkable but much more delicate that your typical DIPA with a very light malt profile. Nonetheless, an excellent beer worth seeking out, but definitely allow it to warm to experience it at its best."
Presentation: 64 oz. growler filled at the brewery yesterday and poured into a pint glass. Kept chilled since being filled. Also got to sample fresh from the tap at the brewery as part of a taster.
750 mL growler kindly delivered to my door by the Thorpes on their trek back to DC. 
750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead stem.
Huge thanks to sideshowe for picking this up for me!
"THIS is a fantastic beer. It pours from the growler with soft small head that lingers and leaves a little lacing. The color is a cloudy orange/yellow and it's fantastic. The nose hits with superior citrus, strong grapefruit and orange. It has a citrus/pine taste and leaves a pleasant and slightly bitter citrus aftertaste. "
"Fresh growler filled yesterday, I sampled this while there and it was great, so here goes review time. "
After a sample earlier at the brewery I'm finally sitting down to a full glass of this stuff. From a 750ml growler filled not even ten hours ago.
"Picked up ehh, 6 hours ago from the brewery. Noticed a crack on the side of my growler so yeah....time to crush a 2L of SS6, solo. First world problems...."
Another great double ipa from Shaun.
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
"Huge frothy creamy head fades semi slowly with big soapy layered lacing, murky milk shake peach orange color"
Hazy as can be froth clinging to the side of the glass. Smells of stron fruit but not juicy like a lot of other NEIPAs. This beer is so smooth to drink!! Strong pungent fruit up front gives way to a little dank hop profile. The flavor lingers and makes me want to take another sip. Overall I highly recommend. I got this all from a 10 day old growler. I can only imagine it fresh.
Don't know where to start. I don't write reviews on beers typically but wanted to give this one a special shout out. Its a stand out beer for its style and probably the best I've had. Soft stone fruits through and through with a pillowy soft and full mouth feel. Don't really know what else is needed to be said.
"I love Pittsburgh brewery scene. So many great brews and probably the OG brewery of Pittsburgh turning out the best IPAs, is Brew Gentlemen. I have had the privilege to try a number of their brews, but have never had the chance to try any of their DIPAs. Whereas I feel General Braddock is a bit lacking, this brew is hits he hop profile perfectly. It is mango, pineapple, stone fruit bomb with a mild bitterness of a fantastic NE IPA. This is a king in a city of champions. It is on par with the top DIPAs in the style. Really love this beer and hope canning is in the future."
Smell: Huge candid tropical fruit melon papaya pineapple peach oranges nectarine some dank herbaceous notes coming through as well.
"L: Warm hazy apricot, honeycomb, and cantaloupe hues with a foamy white head and incredible lacing"
"This is much better than Foshomo, the only two BG IPAs I""ve had to date. The hops pop much more and the mouthfeel is fantastic on this one. Really enjoying it!"
Yeah. They did it. This is a delicious hop juice bomb. Wow this is good. Poured from a growler. Very hazy yellowish brown. Short white head. Fantastic lacing. Strong citrus fresh hop aroma. Orange/grapefruit flavor. A bit strong on the alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is pleasantly heavy. Keep em coming! Go Pens!
750ml swingtop poured into a Brew Gentlemen stem glass:
"Hazy juicy and delicious. This is new England style hops at their finest. I'd even say it's close to rivaling tree house. Well done BG, I will make a point to stop by every time I visit Pittsburgh."
"What a great, drinkable, fruity, juicy DIPA. Look out Tree House!"
Poured into a Libbey brand Snifter purchased at TJ Maxx from a BG 750 swing top. 
"Holy turbid, batman. Love me some haze but this looks like orange juice mixed with baby formula. Good thing that doesn't matter when it comes to the onslaught of melon, pineapple, tangelo on the aroma. Has a hint of pine, too. Same tropical and orangey flavors with a solid grapefruit bitterness adding another dimension to the flavor. A little more carb would do this well to help integrate the flavors, but it is quite smooth and hella juicy. I like galaxy hops in BG's hands."
"L: Opaque turbidity, dull yellow/gold"
Pours like orange juice with a finger of white head.
L - 1-finger offwhite head atop a glimmering orange juice body.
Canned on 10/11/18
"One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience."
Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there.
"This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level. Phenomenal. Best trilltive ever and it’s not close."
"Can, Oct 2018"
Harsh and overly dank .. lot of hop burn and way too chewy ; Galaxy is overshadowed by the honey and this is
"Creamy-looking dark OJ color with a thin finger of off-white head. Nice lacing. Huge aroma of weed, earthy smoked herbs and nuts. They carry over the taste, coupled with orange juice, lime, pithy and piney bitterness and a peppery alcohol bite. Some hop bite, too. Full bodied with a prickly feel. There’s a lot of depth and ton of alcohol in this one, but the nutty, smokey quality when fresh isn’t to my preference. I am interested to see how it changes with some age."
"08/2016 - While I enjoy the base beer, the Galaxy usage is top notch in my opinion. That said, the honey does a nice job balancing the Galaxy; tasty, refreshing, and super flavorful."
"Had on tap at the Trillium Garden on the Greenway a month or so back. Super hazy and golden color. Huge flavors of peach, citrus rind, honey, and resin attack the palate. It's very chewy and sticky in the mouth, a bit heavy in the stomach but still so very drinkable due to the flavor. This beer is incredible and the blend of wildflower honey with Galaxy was near perfect."
Can. White head. Super hazy golden sunset orange. Looks like juice.
"One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Would put this just below Perm 32 for me. I remember having Mosaic Cutting Tiles last year, and thought it was a mess. The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked. They’re knocking these beers out of the park lately."
"Pours a very hazy, cloudy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to a layer and leaves spotty lacing."
"Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, one week since brewing."
"This beer has the beautiful yellow appearance of egg whites, which might be tacky if it weren't backed up by an excellent smell of citrus and peach and a delectable taste of tangerines and brown sugar. Trillium is on one with this masterpiece, which has a texture that feels thick, bites nicely, and finishes crisp. This is one of the best, and I'm very happy to be moving to Boston next year in large part of the guys at Trillium."
"I CANsider myself very fortunate to have been the lucky winner of a buncha CANs in a recent lottery on a different social media site. I merely had to pony up the cost of shipping, which was modest, in return for a buncha CANs for The CANQuest (tm)! I had heard of & was certainly aware of Trillium B.C., but I have not been trading in a while & so I did not give them much thought. I am now interested in drinking & reviewing the entire Small Bird Series, especially Pipsqueak Penguin & Stumpy Duck since I have an affinity for the former & a rubber form of the latter who oversees my drinking & will be in an NBS pic later. "
"A 1 pint can, canned on 26th July 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass."
"Pours a golden hazy orange with a two finger head, quickly dissipating. Smells of peppery hops, stone, earthy, with citrus. Taste is a bitter bite into tropical fruit, juicy and sharp. Lingering bitterness on the end, little bit of booze burn. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy. Not getting much of the honey. This is likely my favorite of the cutting tiles hop varieties. Good beer."
"Pours a very hazy orange/gold with thick head and lacing. Smells wonderful, full flowery sweet, fruit, honey, light hops. The taste is amazing, this beer drinks so clean and is so tasty I am blown away. Flavors follow nose with bursting sweetness balanced by hops and floral notes, the combination in this beer is world class, one of my top beers to date. RESPECT....."
"Very nice, hazy look with great galaxy notes that flow from the glass. Drinks smooth with the same smooth mouthfeel that Trillium always delivers. Galaxy flavor comes through well with a little additional sweetness from the honey"
Can from Rejtable
Unfiltered DIPA with fruity hoppiness to the nose. This is a beer not to be missed! 8/8/17
Tastes like pineapple juice...straight up.
Orange juice looking with a white foam at the service that disappears quite quickly to leave only a ring.
"Tasted from can. Nice complex aroma. Floral notes with citrus and tropical fruits. Taste is very well balanced with nice moderate bitterness. Honey flavor to balance. Notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, floral, honey, caramel. Awesome complex taste. Exceptional IPA"
A - Pours a turbid orange with a one finger fizzy white head. The head leaves a decent amount of soapy lacing.
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
16 oz can couple of weeks old
On tap at Canton. Honey is a little sweet for me.
Canned one week ago. 
"Beautiful beer! Dark Orange, the Slight smell of Citrus, Taste of dank orange juice, Perfect mouthfeel and carbonation. Overall, beers don't get much better than this."
This one pours a very hazy light orange with a small head and lots of lacing.
Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass.
Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can that arrived with friends…I’m getting through them as fast as my liver can take. Canned 4/19/17.
"This is definitely one of the top three beers I've ever drank. It begins with a very complex feel of mango, peach, and melon which is followed by a slight hop bitterness, which is then washed away with honey sweetness. When I think about New England style double ipas, this is the Hallmark."
"16 oz. can. Very hazy bright orange. Smells dynamic, to say the least. Lime, something like a white wine smell, herbal, and a big mango backdrop. My wife started making fun of me as I tried to figure out what it smelled like by suggesting ""guava pastry, cherry blossom, and new tire."" Tastes equally bright, though a little less confounding, as those aromas I was trying to figure out take the form of a floral honey here. Woodsy pine, bright citrus, tropical fruits. Dries out quickly and leaves resin and some lemon. Medium heavy, but dry. This is something. Quite the showcase of the depth of flavor galaxy can provide, though I guess some of that has to be the honey."
Nice classic trillium hazey ipa.
"Opaque medium-pale gold, juice-looking beer, with a few fingers of thick white head... Aromas are citric with dank edges and a floral accent... Flavors bring more dank, funky grapefruit, some sweeter, honeyed fruit deeper down... soft, smooth, and plush with carbonation... super-satisfying - a real stunner in the New England set of IPAs from Trillium... 4/19/17 canning..."
Another solid single hop IPA from the Trillium Cutting Tiles series! Very solid dank IPA but not nearly as juicy and enjoyable as the Mosaic and Citra Cutting Tiles were.
"Loved this beer, I'm a huge fan of Galaxy hops but somehow Trillium still shocks me with the way they use it. I wish I would've bought more since I wound up trading a lot of the ones I bought."
"This beer is awesome. Poured from can into a tall tulip. Hazy dirty orange that looks like they poured orange juice and white grapefruit juice together. Two finger head and some lace. Nice aromas of pineapple and other tropical fruits, with some pine and cannabis. Taste is straight up delicious...same fruitiness as in the nose, with a slight cactus/aloe flavor, and a very soft, very slight finishing bitterness. Mouth feel is perfect for the style...medium body, creamy and fairly sweet, with just enough carbonation to keep it refreshing to the end. Overall, another great Trillium DIPA."
Not my favorite Trillium but not bad.
"Poured from the can into a taster. Consumed approximately two weeks after canning. Typical Trillium hazy yellow look, solid mouthfeel on par with their other offerings. I really enjoyed the Galaxy take on this one."
"Huge haze bomb, all golden yellow and very dense."
This beer is perfect
Possibly the best beer I've ever had. Woah
Poured from the can into a snifter.
"It's a beer that's consistent with the Trillium line, and easily one of the better galaxy hopped beers I have had occasion to try. Still, if galaxy isn't your thing, you may not enjoy this one."
"Canned 19-Apr-17 and served in my Dialed In tulip. Pours a dully orange with a fluffy, half inch, bright white head and a hazy clarity. Nose expresses citrus, pith and stone fruit (perhaps apricot). Taste consistent with nose; however, notice as juicy as suggested. There's also a bit more of an earthy/herbal presence at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light), with a pleasant, even carbonation. Overall, very good - a typical hazy Trillium DIPA. Not a bad thing by any means, but they all start to blend together for me."
"Canned April 19 2017, drinking it just past 1 week. Anndddd I've possibly found a new favorite offering from Trillium - if not my favorite, it's definitely within the top 3. "
16oz can dated 4/17/17.
Canned 8 days ago.
"Turbid bright yellow, nice head retention. smell is very big orange, mango, slightly crackery, and some fresh cut grass. taste is extremely close to orange juice. huge sweet orange, fresh squeezed lemon grass, some tropical pineapple and peach, malt is breadier than the smell is, but still a huge fresh hop bomb. feel was perfection for a DIPA, nice and fuzzy but still thick and pulpy. one of the best brews ive had from the guys at trill, they really know they galaxy hops."
"Pours a turbid somewhat dull pale straw in color with a half finger of white head; this strongly resembles grapefruit juice. Aroma has white grape, nectarine, peach, candied pineapple, and light flowery, honey notes. Taste has candied peach and pineapple upfront followed by white grape, nectarine, a touch of floral honey, and some alcohol in the dry, lightly bitter finish. Medium-light body with moderate+ carbonation. I haven't enjoyed a Cutting Tiles this much since batches 1 and 2 of Artaic. The honey plays very well with the Galaxy here. I'd highly recommended this one."
Can poured into teku glass
"From a 1/2 growler. Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with minimal head. Taste is pineapple, mango, and light orange juice. Soft, juicy, sweet, moderate carbonation, with medium-light body. Reminds me of Tree House's Very Green..Just an amazing tropical beer that showcases Galaxy hops. I get more honey in other Cutting Tiles beers, but this one is all hops..Easily my favorite Cutting Tiles and I love the El Dorado version. Get this one."
This beer is stupid good. Upon pouring this beer into a glass you immediately get the amazing citrus smells. I do not have a very refined nose but the amazing smells were very apparent to me. They were so bold and bright. The beer is thick in a good way and the taste is just phenomenal. This beer is amazing. Bravo
Just another stellar brew from Trillium. As I've come to expect from them - super smooth and full of flavor. Not a juice bomb in a Treehouse sense but just juicy enough and so well made. Great job.
"Revisit from a can dated 10/11/18 so exactly 1 month old! Pours like OJ with a white capped soapy head. Smells of ripe tropical fruits, candied oranges, and some dankness. The taste follows the nose but a little on the sweeter side (in a good way). Feel was soft, velvety,and full. Overall, its Trillium so you know it’s good!"
"Juicy, succulent and balanced, the careful use of wildflower honey gives the exotic hops a riper fruit quality than they can munster on their own. Breaming with vibrancy, the hop-centric beer retains a semi-sweet balance for complexity and smoothness."
"Hazy bright yellow color with white head. Aroma is really dank with lots of chives and green hop matter. Taste follows with intense hops, tropical fruits, vegetal notes and a slight floral note in the background. Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Another great IPA from Trillium."
"16oz can poured into a 12oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 8.24.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"As close as I've had to HF Double Galaxy. Melon, lemon, lime, tangerine, and kiwi all explode in waves of flavor. Minimal bitterness. Honey amps up the mouthfeel and the sweetness."
Serving: Can into a pint glass
"Another exceptional double that drinks like a single, with a creamy balance."
"Everything here is great, but the star of the show is the taste and feel... Wide range of tropical flavors with excellent balance. One of the easier drinking doubles I've tried; had a hard time setting this down. World class for sure!"
"From a pint canned about two weeks ago. Peach color, short head. Nose is all galaxy -- nice tropicals and peach, maybe a hint of honey."
Poured out a hazy golden orange color with a thin white head on top. The smell has heaps of tropical notes to it. The taste is also loaded with lots of fruity bitterness. The feel of the beer is medium bodied and remains very drinkable. Overall it's an outstanding DIPA.
"Pounder can that was filled...no shit, 3 friggen days prior to consumption/this review. Thank you Dan for gifting me with such a freshy. The brew appears a very chalky looking golden color with white cap."
"Orange, tangerine, citrus zest, and some grapefruit pith. Juicy. Grassy. Very dank, sticky and herbaceous. Classic Trillium creamy mouthfeel. Mouth coating bitterness. Real good. Completely different from regular Cutting Tiles/Artaic."
L: Burnt orange hazy hues with a generous white head
"Pale hazy golden straw color with minimal head, pineapple bready and smokey earthy nose, dry pineapple grapefruit on the palate, a long lingering hoppy bitter finish, with moderate mouthfeel and carbonation."
8/16/2016 can drank on 8/25/2016
Pours a hazy (surprise surprise!) yellow with orange hues. It has a small white head that dissipates to a collar that leaves minimal lacing pretty quickly.
Draft at the source. 
"Pretty badly undercarbonated, ruins what would be a pretty decent beer. Still don't think it'd be better than mosiac even if everything else alright and definitely not the treehouse green killer some people have made it out to be."
L - Hazy light orange with barely any head. What was there was pure white.
Canned 8/16/16. Consumed 8/22/16.
I snuck out of work during my lunch break and took the 30 min trek to Trillium to get my hands on this.
"Pours a milky straw color,. The aroma is deafening. The galaxy citrus nose is strong with this one. There is plenty of that tangerine citrus flavor, but the bitterness is abrasively raw. There is a touch of honey on the finish, but I am left wanting more. The first couple batches of Artaic were great because the honey softened up the barky bitterness of the mosaic. I was hoping that the same thing would be the case with the galaxy. Some of it might be due to the freshness of the beer, but I do feel more honey would tame some of the wild bitterness in this beer. It was also a little thin. This is a DIPA with, as of now, unmet potential."
16 oz. can dated 08/16/16
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"HUGE thanks to rowmark for not only the goandpickitupformebro, but the door to door delivery on his way home from the brewery - good look bud!!!"
"Canned on 8/16/16; drank on 8/19/16 in a tulip snifter; another excellent beer from Trillium per usual but as a majorly huge fan of the orginal Artaic and then the recent Cutting Tiles, this variant really changes the nature of the beer alot; I love Galaxy hops but this version seems a little heavier and with much less honey flavor coming through than the previous originals; the flavors don't quite separate themselves and pop quite as much, but still an amazing DIPA that I would have every day of the week"
"Bright peach/orange colored body with a huge haze and a fluffy pale tan head. Aroma is huge on tropical fruits; typical galaxy aromas of pineapple, mango and citrus. Flavor is just enormous; juicy and fruity hops explode with the Galaxy hops coming through in a big way. Feel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly sticky. Great showcase of galaxy and hops in general."
Excellent TIPA! Most TIPAs are heavy on the malty sweetness and aroma and flavor. This was extremely tropical. Would love to have this again.
The worst part is that I only purchased 1 four pack.
Incredible tropical aromatics. Super citrusy with some softening tropical piña character. A little pithy but not bitterness. Much better than last year.
"L - Dark yellow, hazy body"
Another huge thanks goes out to Jay for this. Cheers!

"Drank on tap at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"
Really glad I was able to take an extended lunch break to try this much talked about beer.
Poured from a growler I got about a week ago. Great head. I really don’t pick up a lot of smell at all? Sad! Tastes unbelievable though and goes down so easy you’d never guess it has a 10+ ABV
Poured from a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass. 
16oz. can into a Heady Topper stemless snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
"This beer is a masterpiece in the triple IPA category. It's 10.3% ABV, and drinks like any other of their DIPAS."
16 oz. canned on 05/03/18
"You can smell it from a foot away. Not quite a facsimile for orange juice, but pretty close. This is a Frankenstein hop amalgam. Surprised it has such complexity - a lesser malt base would turn this to a muddled mess. I get lots of different fruits - orange and lime zest give some tang while stone fruits give a nice contrasting unctiousness. It finishes as dry as it can and the body is surprisingly spry for a big beer. Well done, trillium"
"From a 10-day-old can, pours a hazy greenish gold. Fruity and dank with a decent hit of bitterness. Smooth medium feel. Drinks like a much lower ABV beer. Great stuff."
"The lactose in this really adds something positive, as apposed to so many beers. Add a ton of hops and you have a great beer. This showcases everything great about Citra and masks everything bad."
Citra everywhere. Wonderful mouthfeel and body.
On tap at Brewskival 2018.
Finishes smooth and easy. Nose is amazing . Hard to identify what I would change to make it any better.
Poured from a 32 oz growler into a teku glass.
5/9 batch so certainly not the freshest but definitely smooth and nice sweetness but missing on the nose and overall taste- didn’t meet expectations
"So I sat at a share table with friends for about three hours before I was even aware that we had a can of DDH All Citra Everything - a long time wish list item. Towards the end of the evening, we had to decide between this can, and Ethereal Haze. We eventually drank them both, of course - but DDH All Citra stands head and shoulders above every IPA I had that evening."
Can from Kevin
On tap at Other Half.
DDH All Citra Everything - Other Half
"Pours a bright hazy straw yellow with a soapy white head. Nose is vibrant. Citrus juice and lemon zest with hints of malt. Taste of citrus peel, orange, lemon and grapefruit. Nice solid malt base that shines through just enough in this beer to balance it out. Creamy silky mouthfeel. Very smooth beer. Love it as I love me some Citra!"
This beer really shows why Citra is such an amazing hop. Also Other Half did a great job leaving just a touch of bitterness on the finish after all that juicy fruit up front. This was most excellent.
"Look: Yellow, hazy with 2 inch head."
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
Canned 9 days ago. 
this beer definitely say's other half and it showcases the citra hops very well. Great DIPA.
"Poured from the can into a taster. Prominent classic citra flavors as expected, solid but unspectacular mouthfeel. A bit boozy but fairly well hidden at 8.5% ABV."
"16 oz can. Pours cloudy yellow orange with thick lasting foamy head and coating lace. Juice bomb thru the aroma and taste. Juicy n sweet up front, dry n dank in the back. Whoa! This IPA is outstanding."
"32oz growler from the brewery. Pours an opaque pale yellow with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Dank aroma with lots of citrus. Lemon, tangerine, lime, grapefruit and orange. The taste is sweet citrus with some dank and piney hops. Pink grapefruit, sweet tangerine and orange along with some lime zest. Grapefruit and orange finish with a dry mouthfeel. Low bitterness and mild alcohol warmth. Lots of juicy citrus. Another winner."
7/13/17 can drank on 7/26/17
"Dank. Orange, tangerine, Grapefruit zest and pine. Cracker malt profile. Nice amount of citrus bitterness. Drier finish. Sweetness up front but fades into dry bitterness. Creamy feel. Lower carb. Very good."
One of the best beers I've ever had.
CAN: Elegant label design. Pull-tab top. 16 fl oz. Cost was $20 per 4 pack at the brewery. Canned 2 days ago. Purchased at Other Half today.
"It has been two years since I returned to Other Half, and I must admit that they are still maintaining their exceptional beer qualities. This beer is truly refreshing, very nice color, with an exceptional aroma, and a great taste!"
"I got one can on trade from Tom C. and enjoyed it whilst grilling. It looks golden, cloudy and leaves lots of lacing. The feel is soft and smooth. The taste is all citra, pineapple mixed with apricot, and finishes slightly sweet, crisp and clean without being overly bitter. My favorite beer in a long while."
"Hazy golden, big head and great lacing. Muted aromas, citrus and dank. Notes of immulsufied citrus fruit, light lime, pineapple and dank greenery. Fluffy, medium, well carbonated but soft and lightly dry. Amazing world class DIPA, waves of citra."
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Thanks Ryan for sharing. 
"The tropical smell on this beer is incredible. I love how much Citra there is here and it feels very creamy like most Other Half beers do. Lupulin powder should be added to everything,"
Another amazing example of a DDH Other Half Brew! Pours cloudy and orange and looks like OJ! Dank and Juicy and full of hops on the front of the palate and the finish! Great brew!
Big thanks to CanConPhilly for this 
Look: murky light orange color similar to pinapple juice. About a fingers worth of white head that fades quickly but leaves nice lacing. 
"From can. Really hazy, milky golden color with creamy off-white head. Aroma has ripe peaches and some spoiled pineapple. Taste is sweet at first, juicy with some overripe fruits and light hop and alcohol burn on the finish. Low bitterness, hop astringency. Full bodied, smooth carbonation. Overall a really nice NE style DIPA."
Very nice mouthfeel is what allowed this beer to be even more that the regular version which is a melange if pineapple juice and dank ganja. This could be in the running for official DIPA of the Dead.
Absolutely delicious. OH's double dry hopped offerings are outstanding but this is top tier for sure. Citra mastery with that delicious hop powdered candy aroma and taste.
"Dusty pumpkin color, too hazy to see a dying star though two inches of the brew."
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 2/24/2017) into a Veil Brewing house glass 
"Perfection in a can. After pouring into an OH teku glass, the first noticeable characteristic is the delectable aroma. Pineapple, lemon, and orange scents jump out at you as one would expect with the almighty Citra. The look is light amber orange haze with that nice creamy foam sitting on top. As for the taste, it absolutely does not disappoint. Bright lemon on the front with ever so subtle piney sour tones gives way to pineapple, tangerine, and finally creamsicle. As it opens up the flavors expand and deepen so drink this shit slowly. Every burp for some time after will taste almost as good as the beer itself, singing with lupulin glory. At this moment, this one ties with the OH DDH Double Mosaic Dream for my favorite beers of all time. While the DMD has the sweeter blueberry tones swirling around in the background, this one has the citrus punch. Get it and get it now."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a one and a half finger head, retentions not great but the lacing is."
Canned 2/24/17 (LIKE OH). Enjoyed 3/6/17. Acquired in a trade.
"Although an exceedingly high bar, this beer has reasonable claim to the best Other Half has produced. Pours a rich, incredibly hazy orange. Surprisingly creamy for such a citrus-forward beer. Absolutely masks the 8.5%, and makes for a beer that you don't want to stop after just one. With Other Half double dry hopping so much these days, this is a must-find."
"L: Honey, apricot, and hazy pumpkin hues with a generous white foamy head"
review from yesterday's can release...thanks again Paulie for the goandpickitupformebro. 
"Hazy straw, apricot in the deeper parts of the glass. Smells like juicy oranges and sweet candied peel. Orange juice - tropical body, rich mango and peach, papaya, hardly any bitterness. Fizzy and dry, dissipates quickly, feel is slightly thin."
"Pours an off white orange with a one finger head, thin and tiny bubbles, nice foamy lacing. Smells sweet and sticky, tropical citra and citrus fruits. Taste is smooth, juicy fading into bitter. Sweetness from the nose still present, somewhat of a harsh booze bite at the end, but not too much. Really nice DIPA."
"Drank on tap at Row 34, Boston, MA"
"Finishing the last of my cans from the batch canned on 11/03/16. Poured a very murky orange color, resembling orange juice with a foamy white top. The smell immediately hits as you open the can and gets stronger with the pour. Tons of tropical fruit and pine jump at you. The flavor and nose are almost perfectly synced but add in some malt breadiness to the tropical fruit sweetness and pine bitterness. The feel is a little above medium verging on thick with a decent amount of carbonation. This IPA has it all. Great smell, a deep balanced flavor, and very easy to drink for the ABV."
Poured from can.
just one word:
Canned 1/14/17. Consumed 1/14/17.
"Amazing IPA this one goes on the short list for best beers of 2016. Well done Other Half. Incredibly hoppy yet there is great balance. The nose is citrus, lemon, orange, with some pine and the taste follows exactly"
"Canned 11/3/16 with ""THE PINK"" on the bottom, it pours bright cloudy yellow/gold color with a solid 2 finger foamy white head that was packed with bubbles, dissipating very slowly and leaving outstanding foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down as well as a foamy layer on top. Another gorgeous looking Other Half DIPA. "
White head with lace. Golden orange sunset.
"Canned 11/3/16, drinking on 11/20/16. Poured into a tulip, the beer is a murky pale hazy yellow, very nice lacing. Aroma and taste is tropical fruit juice. Guava, melon, mango, low bitterness if any."
"Bought this beer when it was released, as it had a date of 11/3 with ""The Pink"" written above it. Love nearly everything that Other Half puts out and given that Citra is one of my favorite Hops in a beer, this was one that I eagerly anticipated having. If you like your beers juicy, wet, and drinkable, this fell into that category as it was worth the wait for this insanely enjoyable brew!"
"Poured out as a hazy golden yellow color wit ha white creamy looking head on top. The smell of the beer is mostly all hops, lots and lots of hops. The taste is similar to the nose, lost of fruity citrus hops with a juicy bitter finish. The feel is smooth, kind of creamy. Overall it's a solid brew."
16 oz. can into a tulip. Canned 11/03/16.
From a can dated 10/3/16 THE PINK.
You get that Citra with the Lupulin which provides a more palatable experience. The Malts provide that sweetness that reminds me of Sunday Morning Breakfast. The ABV is just right not overwhelming the stability of a man. The color reminds of a beautiful sunset at Laguna Beach
L - 1-finger sparse bright white head atop a milky orange body.
Canned on 10/9/18
"Had this on 2018-10-31 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2018-10-09"
"Pours an opaque orange with nearly two fingers of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, papaya, pine, dank, and tangerine, mingling tropical fruit juice with biting Northwest hops. Wheaty, biscuity, toasty malts shine through in the middle. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, peach, pine, and light dank. Aside from the abundant hops, wheat and biscuity malts show through. Mouth feel is lightly effervescent with a chalky, grainy texture. It has a medium viscosity. Overall, flavorful and dense, bit less juicy and smooth from other Trillium offerings. "
"Looks great and smells OK but compared to DDH Fort Point this is kind of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Stillings Street, this was the worst of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!"
3 days old
Sweet tangerines and grapefruit. Thick as well. Very well made.
Killer
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned July 30th 2018.
OJ Bomb!
Tropical tropical tropical! Great hazy IPA. Pours with a thick head that retains. Smooth and not at all bitter. I get a very small touch of dryness at the end of the taste. But all around this is a fantastic beer and one of my favorites. No complaints with this beer at all.
Appearance: Pours cloudy and goldenstraw color with a thick two fingers of foam; webby lacing and good retention
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a one pint can on May 14, 2018. A double dry hopped version of Melcher Street this amped up American IPA features a heavy dose of Mosaic hops. The spicy, resinous, herbal aroma bursts with nuances of tart citrus, tangerine, clementine and subtle green onion. Bold flavors of under-ripe melon, cantaloupe rind, and pineapple are highlighted with gentle bitterness and delicate, biscuity malt character. Awesome."
"16 oz canned 2/28/18 delivered into an IPA glass. A hazy orange with active carbonation, a three finger white head that rises before receding. Pine, earth, and tropical fruit on the nose. The taste retains the dirt, some of the citrus/fruit elements, pine/mint, and grains. The feel is soft, carbonation medium low. Had this and Sleeper street, each a little different, but definitely recommended."
"Pours a murky yellow to orange with a billowy white head on heavy pour. Nose is citrus driven. Orange juice, grapefruit peel and tangerine. Taste follows nose. Very citrus forward with notes of ripe tropical fruit and earthy tones of malt grasses and dankness. Medium bodied with a light carbonation bit. Finishes crisp and dry. Enjoyed DDH Melcher Street."
Tied for first in a blind taste test with 7 similar ABV IPAs. A lot going on with Fruity fruity tastes on the front end and some butter dankness on the finish.
"16 oz. can dated 4/4/18, purchased from brewery. Poured into Belgian ale glass."
"Been drinking Trillium from the get-go; been drinking NE IPAs before it had a name. My palate is toast at this point, but even still - this is the most tropical, fruit-forward, resiny, pungent IPA out there. Looking for low bitterness and a humongous tropical fruit-taste? This is your beer."
Look: comes in a beautiful straw gold color. Bright white head. There wasn’t much head retention. 
"On draft at Trillium-Canton taproom. This has all the color and appearance of orange juice. I had this after Scaled Way Up, and this was a bit more citrus juicy (as opposed to tropical fruit) than Scaled Way Up. But it was also sweeter and smoother on the end (not as dry as Scaled Way Up)."
Might be my new favorite.
"16oz can, dated 8.24.17, poured into a Trillium Permutation Series stemmed glass. Enjoyed on 9.11.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
I go back and forth on this beer sometimes. It always has a perfect mouth and great nose. Nice blend of juicy mouth and bitter finish. Definitely better within a couple of weeks of canning
Poured to a teku glass.
Golden orange and super cloudy like orange juice. Topped with 2 fingers of yellow tinged head.
"Canned 12/26/17, 08:12."
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into a snifter. received in an IP trade. 
"This beer pours a super cloudy orange yellow color that looks just like orange juice. The head is huge, pillowy and bright white with excellent retention and leaves a ton of sudsy rings of lacing all over the glass."
"Very smooth, not bitter, good citrus taste"
"Pours a very cloudy bright orange gold colored. Aroma is pungent with sweet tropical notes like pineapple and papaya. Very alluring. Taste is similar but with some citrus tartness added in. Feel is very soft with a little seltzer behind it. Bitterness is moderate, malt is predictably low. This is a great beer, full of hop flavor and the feel is perfect."
"This is definitely one of my favorites from Trillium. Dank, citrusy; easy drinking. A great example of the neipa style done correctly."
"It pours orange and very hazy with a huge head. The aroma is tropical, citrus like and dank. The taste is very well balanced but with a nice and lingering bitterness toward the end. Full body and little carbonation."
Can poured into snifter.
Look- Mix of OJ and Pineapple Juice. Hazy but with a nice brightness to it
"16oz can purchased at the Canton brewery. Hazy orange color and fruity nose is followed by complex flavors that include mango, melon and very possibly others. Grapefruity slight bitterness dries out the finish. A very tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma is really intense with juicy fruity hop notes like peaches and nectarines. Taste follows with juicy hops, really fruity and tropical, low to medium bitterness. Medium body with soft carbonation. Another great IPA from Trillium."
"thanks to recent Buffalo trading. Good, understated, but present hop aroma. Hazy golden body. Very crushable. Citrus hops. Smooth mouthfeel for an IPA."
"This was my last beer at the Trillium brewery in Canton for the evening. Boy, it was a good one. The appearance to the beer was a murky, dark orange but with no head. The aromas to this beer were very heavily grassy hops mixed with citrus fruits. This heaviness followed with the taste of the beer, making it a very hoppy and piney tasting beer. Carbonation was very good as well. Overall, this was a great beer to end the night on."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a half inch head that dissipated quickly and left almost no lacing. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, apricot, mango, a bit of onion, pine and some sweet malt. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, finishes moderately bitter and dry."
"From a fresh growler, pours a hazy deep gold. Thin head dissipates quickly with little lacing. Smell and taste feature an explosion of passionfruit, with lemon, tangerine and some spicy herbs appearing as well. The very slightest hint of onion, which works well as a counterpoint to the sweet, tart fruits. Looks under-carbed but doesn't drink that way. Body is a little on the thin side. Modest bitterness. Adds up to a really good beer."
"Thanks goes out to MastaaaGrillaaa for this brew, from NBS BIF#6"
Cloudy appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a nice blend of hops and citrus. Taste is also a very nice blend of hops and citrus that is very nice.
Canned 12 days ago.
"Appearance: cloudy pale orange in color with a 1"" head that falls to a thin surface covering."
16 oz can poured into speigelau IPA glass canned on 8/24
"The best DDH beer on tap at the time we were there (trumped both DDH Fort Point and DDH Stillings St). Dank and bitter, but thick nonetheless. Absolutely incredible."
Double Dry Hopped?
"Tasted from can. Pours a super hazy yellow with white head. Aroma of pine, resin, pineapple, melon, spices. Moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of grapefruit, mango, melon, pineapple, resin, biscuits. Incredible imperial IPA."
"On tap at Trillium Canton. Hazy orange. Smells of garlic all over. Pungent garlic and citrus. Tastes of orange, grapefruit, some grain, and a hefty garlic bite. Awesome. Medium body. Tingly carbonation. Delicious."
This beer has a gorgeous muted mustard yellow color with a creamy head of 2 fingers. Lots of fuzzy distortion skirted along the lines of the glass. 
EDIT (8/10/18):
Picked up from their Fort Point location. The canning date is messed up on my four-pack but I was able to piece together that it was canned on 17-JUL-17 from the various cans.
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
Look is hazy dark straw with nice slightly off white head. 
A: Poured into a Duvel tulip to a hazy light orange topped by a finger of dense white head that fades to a collar around the edge of the glass with some lacing. Pretty sure I saw some hop debris fall into the glass during the pour.
"Trillium is one of my favorite brewery's and this is one of the reasons why. Bursting with flavor yet so well balanced and smooth. Melcher is one of the best in their street series and adding DDH puts in on another level. Well done, fantastic beer"
"Pours creamy yellow. Nice one finger white head. Aroma peach, pineapple and orange peels. Taste follows the nose with mango. Excellent beer as always from trillium. Big fan of them."
"Canned 6/2/17. Mosaic hops are by far my favorite so maybe a bit of a biased review here, but man what a great brew this is. Perfectly balanced with a great bitter finish. Taste follows aroma to the t. Trillium rules."
Canned on june 8 2017
"phenomenal ipa, they should all be this good, and for those who think all hazy ipas are they same, they just arent, and for the haters, you havent tasted this one yet!!! one of the cooler mosaic beers i have had in awhile, this is a hop everyone is using now, and for good reason, but the mosaic heavy beers are all starting to get a little samey to me, so its nice to see it in a context like this, where its juiciness is over the top, its bitterness mild, and its relationship to the other hops is highly synergistic, not dominant or crowding out like. real good. i like the dry but flavorful malt base, some wheat too perhaps with the pale barley, it creates a nice platform thats sturdy enough for all these hops, a lesser malt base would be insufficient i reckon. strong citrus in the nose, more pine and pineapple together in the flavor, i burp it and taste it long after i swallow it, insanely fresh, creamy feeling, and satisfying. i have had enough of these cloudy ipa types now to know that there are good ones and bad ones, natural ones and forced ones, honest ones and look at me types. this is as good as they get. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing! feel lucky to have enjoyed this, its fantastic and a high water mark for the style for me."
"First had 3/18/17 at home on trade from Andy K. Typical trillium juice bomb of an IPA. Great body, with tropical flavors and a subtle earthiness. Not my favorite from them, but a super solid offering."
"A tan mildly gold color with a constant creamy head and lacing. Smell is mildly pungent hop scents with citrus notes. Taste is strongly hoppy-bitter, funky, citrusy fruit flavors with a slight tang on the back end. Mouthfeel is juicy, creamy, and smooth. It's a well balanced beer and very well done."
Five Alive. Tangerine and lime tend to shine through. Just a tad of sweetness to balance everything out. Pillowy soft mouthfeel and a big citrus nose.
"This pours like a tradition NE IPA, but the spiciness of the Mosaic hops really comes through."
Acquired via trade. 2 month old can. 
"Looks pretty murky, dull orange. "
"Got this one through a trade with my buddy Matty. Lucky for me he spends a fair amount of time in Boston for work. Really love the look of this beer, a murky orange than is hazy to the point that I can't see the other side of the glass. About an inch of head that lasted about a minute but, gave way to some nice lacing. Very tropical citrus smell but DEFINITELY picking up that hint of green onion, not something you would expect but it's an interesting touch. For a double dry hopped IPA this is super smooth. Tastes juicy with pineapple and grapefruit prominently featured with a hoppy and slight honey finish. Very soft feel here with a comfortable amount of carbonation. This is a phenomenal brew. I am an IPA guy for sure but that has very little to do with my review. This beer looks beautiful, smells delightful and unique, and tastes delicious. Fair warning Matt, next time you head to Boston you might be coming back with a case of this for me if it's available!"
A: hazy orange color with some pale straw notes
"My fav Trill, fa rill."
"My first shot at tasting a Trillium beer and it didn't disappoint. The nose was as juicy as any IPA I have ever had. The taste followed suit with a huge fruity, hoppy, smooth juice bomb. And to top it off the look in the glass was hazy and very ""orange juice"" like. This was quite a treat."
Pour is the stuff of hazy golden dreams and heightened expectations which are soon to be met. 
"Pour is that typical hazy medium orange, trillium look. Extra frothy head with nice lacing. Tropical fruit forward in the aroma, virtually no malt presence. Mango, melon, pinneapple, honey, kiwi. Taste follows the nose well, getting hints of blueberry and tangerine from the mosaic, but not as mosiac forward as cutting tiles. The Columbus balances this out. Mouthfeel is pillowy and soft as usual. Fantastic beer, one of the more tropical fruit forward ones I've had from them."
"Canned 1/23/17, featuring Mosaic and Columbus hops; 7.2% abv..."
Looks the part. Smells the part. Tastes the part. Feels the part. Overall just a great great beer from the folks at Trillium! Maybe the best that I have had from there?
"Pours cloudy goldenrod with some agitated bubble activity. Smell is great- passionfruit-orange-guava juice that is big in Hawaii, and a hint of sour diesel marijuana. Possibly the best smelling beer I've ever had. Taste is a tropical citrus bomb. P-O-G, tangerine, peach, and even some sweet melon. Texture is trillium soft. Probably my favorite Trillium brew to date."
16oz can into speiglau
A very nice beer.
"Turbid golden orange, thick foam but minimal lacing."
One of the best I've had from Trillium. Hazy as is to be expected but the hops just explode out of the glass and into your nose. The flavor perfectly backs up the aromas as well. Excellent
"There is a LOT of pineapple here. I enjoy the blend of pineapple in an IPA. The hoppiness just rounds out the beer in a perfect way. In a way, the booze is a bit too strong, maybe if I had let it rest a week or two"
"Bright orange color, tall white head and spotty lacing. Spicy resinous hop aroma. Notes of citrus spray, clementine rind, underripe melon, stone fruit near the pit, and biscuit cracker. Soft, crushable, and dry. Solid IPA, little too green on the hop profile for my liking."
"murky golden orange color, fluffy tight white head, some solid patches of lace. aromas of berry jam, grassy hops, mint, dankness, orange peel."
Two week old can into a tulip. Pours muddy orange. Smells of oranges and spicy hops. Taste is aligned with the smell; mostly orange with a little blueberry and a good amount of green spiciness from the hops. Feels creamy and smooth with low carbonation. Overall a very good IPA but I was expecting a little more.
Nice smooth IPA with crisp pine notes.
"On-tap 12/31/2016 at the brewery in Canton, MA, served in a tulip glass."
"Grayish hued orange juice looking appearance with a finger of airy white head. Big aroma of citrus, melon and peppery herbal hops. Similar taste, quite smooth, with a nice balance of herbal hops, orange rind, tangerine, malt backbone and a bitter, peppery finish. Medium to heavy bodied with a prickliness on the tongue. Solid."
too citrusy
"Like biting into a clementine, but with more hops. "
look is orange haze.
"Beautiful bright orange, nose isn't as pungent as I was expecting compared to DDH Fort Point but still great citrus sweet aroma and taste follows with a slight sharp hop bite, Trillium is just killing it in the NE IPA. Great beer!"
Probably my favorite of the double dry hopped series from Trillium. Such an amazing golden beer. It is so smooth and the hops and citrus notes go so good together. Great beer. Highly recommended.
16oz can from the Fort Point brewery in Boston
"This poured out as a hazy golden color with a solid white head on top. Good lacing and retention. The smell is obviously hoppy with notes of tropical fruits and subtle dank aromas. The taste is also quite hoppy, it's still very good for the style. The feel smooth and very drinkable. Overall It's awesome, I'd drink it anytime."
"Had on tap at Canton location. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color, with 1/2 inch head. Smell is huge papaya. Taste is also huge papaya, mango, and wet hops. Medium bodied and carbonation with slight bitterness. I cannot get over how much more I like this than Melcher Street. The double dry hopping makes this a delightful juicy treat. Delicate and complex. This may be one of my favorite Trillium beers."
"Among the most drinkable of the great NE hop bombs. It's got much that one would expect in such an offering: intense tropical fruit, hints of citrus, plenty of hop bitterness. Sometimes--and that can be a great thing, to my mind--those combos can be overpowering. WIth Dry Hopped Melcher St, the combination is intensely flavorful and yet--and this, too, is great, in a different way--smooth and balanced. Slightly maltier than Mettle, the other Trillium IPA I've had. They're batting two for two. I'm ready for more of their offerings."
"Appearance - Pours orange cloudy color with nice white head, great lacing."
"16 oz can, dated 8/30/16."
Worst dry hop trillium imo
16oz can.
Can received in trade with Kevin.
Pours a turbid apricot golden color. Aroma is juicy tropical fruit with some citrus. Flavor is very juicy and has notes of tropical fruit and citrus with a nice lingering aftertaste. Has a nice body and overall a really nice beer.
"Canned 8/31/16. Consumed 9/7/16. Classic trillium haze. Smells dank and almost herbal. Taste is almost spicy, but not in a hot way - it's difficult to describe."
"tall can, purchased at the brewery. Canned about 5 days ago....so, yeah its fresh.."
Poured from a two-day old can into a tulip glass:
"A bit middle-of-the-road on the Trillium scale for me. Of course it was still very drinkable, but I remember being much more wowed by others like Galaxy Dry Hopped FP."
A beautiful beer. Great aromas of that super dry hop! smooth mouth feel and a clean crisp finish. As Trillium beers go this may be my favorite. Everything one could ask for
32 oz growled tell was poured into a shifter.
"Ug, didn't realize this was mosaic... ""subtle green onion. "" why the hell would anyone want green onion in their beer?!!! I just really hope they got one of the few good batches of the mosaic."
"Hazy Pale orangish color with about one finger of frothy foam. Tropical/citrus fruit is abundant in the nose, orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit. light, cracker-like malt character. More of the same in the taste, the dry hop character is incredible. This beer has a ton of dry hop sediment, so pour slowly if that type of thing turns you off. light on carbonation, overall good mouthfeel."
Another dry hopped work of art by Trillium. They really own the dry hopped take on beers. This one is up there when it comes to double dry hopped juice bombs.
Bottled 5/4/2016.
"This beer is fantastic! I am digging the orange juice look. As soon as I cracked open the bottle, I could smell citrus. Pineapple, orange, mango. This beer is not the best beer Trillium makes, but definitely a top 5. Nice citrus up front with the taste. I feel it is lacking a little after taste, but that is being picky. Enjoy this one. Cheers!"
L:2.5
"Bottle shared by Mike the other night, thanks man."
Another great DDH selection!
Pours out that classic super turbid/hazy brighter golden orange with a thin lacing of white head.
750ml bottle. Served in a HF stemmed glass.
"L: Bright, hazy piss yellow with an eggshell white head faded to a ring."
Too much bitters in the after taste.
"750 poured into tulip. About a month old, date rubbed off but picked up in middle of Feb. "
A: Pours a cloudy peach color with a half finger bone white head. 
"Usually qualities from Trillium, turbid, juicy, hoppy and very balanced. This one seemed a little more bitter on the finish than most of their stuff. I enjoyed this one slightly less than others from them, still very good though."
Anything Trillium Double Dry Hops is amazing.
Hazy yellow. White head with lace.
"Unbelievable. Cheers, Ben!!"
A - Poured the vintage Trillium IPA look: Full hazy orange juice-like colour with a massive golden glow and a small amount of eggshell coloured head.
"Trillium's dry hopped beers are just incredible. I have yet to find one that I didn't like and this one is no exception. Very fruity with notes of pineapple and other tropical fruit. The bitterness on the backend bites a little, but still super crushable."
"Crazy opaque pour -- grapefruit/clementine on the nose, tastes just the same. Didn't really get that ""green onion"" note luckily. Trillium DDH series is throwing down some fire, putting it at or above most highly touted IPAs these days."
"Looks like a lot of other Trillium pours, crazy murky pale gold. Smells of grapefruit rind, some pine and a touch of lemon, very nice ! Taste is darn good, I get some of that classic double dry hopped tingly bite. Very juicy as usual with Trillium. The feel is quite good. Pretty full feeling, not a hop shake, but full and Easy drinking. Solid!"
"750 ml bottle. Pours cloudy light orange with thick white head, fades leaving coating lace. Grapefruit and pineapple juice aroma, smells so fresh. Big juicy flavors, tropical fruit sweetness with an overriding grapefruit bitterness throughout the sip, without being overpowering. Hard not to just gulp this down. Dry earthy herbal finish. Thin to medium mouthfeel but very silky. Wow this brew is excellent, thx to @buking21 for the chance to try this one."
L: Bright orange hues and an intense hazy body - I'm not going to lie this looks like orange juice! Generous and soapy white head with ample lacing
"An INCREDIBLE IPA, one of the best I've had. Strong citrus notes in the nose, very dank, very EXCELLENT."
750ml bottle dated 02/24/16
"Great IPA. It pours a pale,hazy, golden color with a nice foamy head. The smell is incredible. It has pineapple, mango, apricot, straight tropical fruits. Taste is tropical fruits with a nice dankness. Awesome"
"Late to review, consumed fresh"
"Pours a bright orange with veins of copper and amber running through. Off white head. Some peach and pineapple in the aroma. It tastes like what I would imagine a pineapple creamcicle would taste like, with just enough underlying bitterness. It feels a bit thin and stale. I've had it fresh and it's been great, but this bottle is feeling the age a little bit."
Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter. It's pretty smeared but I'm pretty sure the label reads 09/24/15.
DDH Melcher
"just like it's non-dry hopped counterpart, except with an added layer of greatness. pours a darker orange/yellow, but even hazier glow than regular Melcher Street. smell is that same orange/clementine that melcher street delivers, but stronger and with an added ""piney"" element to it. taste is huge, in your face hops with big juicy orange/citrus flavors, but yet still finishes dry and has very little malt (which is great in a beer like this). carbonation was perfect as it always is with Trillium 750ml bottles, definitely one of my favorites from them."
Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Trillium Tulip glass. Thanks Big Julius for picking this up at the brewery this past weekend. 
"From the 750L bottle into a cool tulip. Pumpkin colored, hazy, fizzy, with a bountiful foamy head that doesn't want to stay in my glass. S: This is the best smelling beer I've ever smelled - the only 5.00 I've ever given. Fruit, sex and fresh baked bread... words totally fail me (not in time to stop me from typing that it smells like sex, but still). T: Follows the nose, delightfully, with sharp pine notes, dank, sharply bitter and delicious. F: Like cream soda, medium body, smooth and with the ideal amount of carbonation. O: The regular Melcher Street was good but this is mind blowing. I'm torn between jamming my nose as far into the glass as it will go and taking a nap in it or sucking the whole bottle down as fast as I can."
"Reviewed from a bottle poured into a tulip. I just reviewed standard Melcher and had another bottle to compare to this one side by side. The nose couldn't get much better than the standard, so new improvement on that score of my other review. The taste though - more bitterness on the ddh for the better. The tropical fruit, grapefruit, and slight peachiness are still there, but there is a huge dose of dankness and earthy bitterness that round out the flavor in a fantastic way. As with many trillium beers, the carbonation in the bottled offerings do the beer service. My standard Melcher review was a little lower because I thought it laid too heavy on the palette from the growler. But really, I'm splitting hairs here. This version is better, but all of there hoppy offerings are just head and shoulders above anything else out there."
"Poured from the bottle into two MBC pint glasses. Bottled 9/24...enjoyed a day later. Pours far clearer than any Trillium brew I've had. Honestly, I was a little surprised. Light amber, tinted orange, body with a finger of fluffy white head. Nose is full of dank weediness, tropical fruits, and peach. Taste follows suit. A delicious beer with an inviting mouthfeel. Another Trillium home run. That part wasn't a surprise."
9/14/15 notes: 
"Pours cloudy golden orange with a three finger head. Smells really citrusy like sweet orange, almost an orange creamsicle with dank pine and and earthy notes. Taste is smooth with and chalk full of hops. Citrus is very present, but the hops hog the spotlight. Really delicious, highly, highly drinkable. Light and fluffy mouth feel, goes down dry, bitter and easy. Overall, like all ""Double Dry Hopped"" showings from Trillium, DDH Melcher Street is fantastic."
Bottled about two and a half weeks ago. Tulip glass.
Pours a crisp yet cloudy orange with solid decent head. Disappears quickly but nice spatter lacing. Beautiful nose. A blend of the Pine Tree perfume and simply citrus spray. Flavor is biting into a cantaloupe with a hint of pineapple. Sticky sweet coating. Amazing beer and better with each round.
side by side with pliny. bottled 4/27/15. great murky yellow frothy head that coated the glass in lace. straight up oj. blast of citrus in my mouth. big yum.
Updated 12/7/15
"Hazy, light pineapple yellow in color with a thin, white lacing and minimal head."
The aroma on this beer is insane. If you close your eyes and sniff you glass you can almost imagine you are walking around a hop field. So much hops hit your nose (which absolutely makes sense...its a double dry hopped beer)
"Second time having this and I gotta ask, why did they switch up the mosaic and Columbus hops w onion and garlic? Very reminiscent of a baby version of the latest onion Artaic- really stinks for me because the taste on this one diminished from a 5 to 4. Ok maybe not that bad, but def way to much of a rinds of nectarines taste vs what I remember. That means this is booboo."
"042715. Another perfectly hazy brew with a gorgeous head and great lace. Holy hop assault. Super pungent, bitter (in a good way), floral, citrusy, piney, fresh cut grass, fresh alpine air, God's body odor...every aroma a hop could possibly contribute to a beer. Flavor is so much damn fresh fruit. It's actually kinda ridiculous. Fantastic, crisp, refreshing finish. Way too easy to drink. Just massive hops while at the same time being a complete beer, not one-dimensional. Has the body and some malt to remind you that this is actually beer, not hop juice. No alcohol presence. I'm happy this is a 750ml but still not enough!"
"Hugely aromatic and flavored IPA. This features a hop flavor that I generally dont like, however the execution of this beer was incredible."
"Cloudy yellowish orange hazy look. Looks wonderful. Lots of pine, citrus in the nose. Taste is citrusy and juicy with the ddh addition giving it a very grapefruit taste. Great thick mouth feel. I love this beer. Another great Trillium beer."
Great beer. Highly aromatic but smooth and easy to drink. Well made.
Bomber poured into antique German bier chalice
"Can they pack any more hops into this? Very spicey for an IPA, some passion fruit, and bitter as @#¿÷"
"The beer comes in a gorgeous bright hazy gold with a touch of orange, a big fluffy white head."
"First off, this beer looks absolutely fantastic. Some aren't a fan of cloudy beers, but I love it. It looks like orange juice. "
"I am bias when it comes to this beer, it is my all time favorite. It is beautiful to look at, nice and cloudy in a glass even when held up to the light. The smell is danky and has a bit of onion. Tastes nice and hoppy. I can barely detect any malt flavor. I love the carbonation. To me this beer is perfect."
"A: Hazy, light pineapple yellow in color with a thin, white lacing and minimal head."
Poured from a growler.
Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. This was bottled earlier today.
Incredible and very drinkable. Tried a bunch of Trilliums in one sitting and this one stood out.
"A - Same as the Mosaic FPPA but with less lacing, a little more deep gold/orange glow."
Very well balanced with a slight bittering edge.
One of the best IPA experience ever! A must try if you can ever get one.
DD Melcher St pours a hazy orange/yellow with a moderate creamy head on top. The foam fades slowly leaving lines and spots of lace behind.
Dank and tropical but something is wrong. Never had a problem with a trillium IPA but this has a strong burnt rubber/plastic smell that comes through in the taste. Still looks and feels amazing but will have to revisit...
"Amazing beer. Super nose and taste. Pungent onions dominate both nose and flavor. Superb beer, unique."
"A: Hazy yellow, minimal head retention and lacing"
L: Hazy yellow/straw color
"this is a top 5 IPA/IIPA I have ever had. Super Dank, Super Fruity, Super Amazing. This is a fantastic beer."
"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Bottled on 010315. Pours a dull, golden orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a dense, one inch, bright white head that eventually dissipates into a consistent 1/8th inch cap. A band of lacing and some swaths coat the bowl as the brew recedes. Great nose - candied citrus notes upfront with a faint earthy/herbal quality towards the back. Taste starts out slightly floral at first, followed by rind and a kiss of tangerine towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of crisp and a tinge of acidity that prickles the back of the throat and lightly stimulates the salivary glands. The standard version of this beer is very good but the dry-hopping adds a great additional dimension. Top notch."
"Pours a beautiful, translucent pale golden color with finger of bone-white head that has good retention. Smell is evergreen, citrus rind, hint of cat-piss. Very refreshing. Flavor has a really nice bitterness that carries through. Citrus rind, grapefruit juice, pine. Mouthfeel could be a little more hefty, but doesn't take away from the overall drinking experience."
"Bottle shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul. Bottled 3 January 2015. Orange body, slightly hazy. White frothy head. Lovely aroma. Oh my. Citrus fruits and fresh hops abound. Aroma is simply perfect. Flavor is not quite up to the level of the aroma, but nonetheless this is terrific. World class. Wow."
"Another complex and sophisticated hoppy offering from Trillium. Cloudy gold in the glass, not unlike a saison profile. The dry hopping really comes through in a big way. The nuance and delicateness of the hops is extraordinary. The nose is mango, sticky weed and cut grass. Flavors keep unfolding and unfolding after each sip. Pineapple, straw, mango, dank weed. The whole affair is dry, but the finish especially tucks the flavors back in for the next sip."
"This beer has an awesome smell. Creamy, fluffy, smooth, as good as it gets. I think this is the best single IPA that I have ever had. Trillium can basically do no wrong."
Just bursting with mango and orange tropical notes. So balanced and cleanly bitter.
Bottled on 1/3/15 Enjoyed on 1/13/15
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, from a 750 bottle dated 1/3/15."
"Look: Turbid, light orange, head fades fast"
"Bottle. Pours a hazy, deep orange color with a strong, doughy head that is off-white. Lots of stretched, cloudy lacing. Aroma is plenty enticing but honestly not as intense and overpowering as I was expecting. Aromatically, I feel as though this one didn't take to the double dry hopping as well as the other Trillium brews that have withstood the same treatment. Still, it's fairly potent. Scent is heavy on citrus and spicy hoppiness. Marijuana, melon and pineapple. Some pastry malt. Flavor is on point; more so than the nose. The hops rush over me quickly but also never become too dramatically bitter. Trillium usually doesn't torch the palate with unnecessary bitterness. This tastes like a tropical fruit purée with a dash of the dankness. Mango, melon, peach, tangerine, hop-spice and some greens. Just enough welcoming, soft malt to even things out. The body is slightly creamy. The carbonation is mellow. High drinkability. I haven't had the normal Melcher in a while but I am unsure if this one equals it. Hard to say if the Double Dry Hopping really enhanced this one all that much but it's still tasty."
"High ratings are deserved! Double dry hopping makes all of their beers dank. It's funny bc when I had melcher in the summer, it wasn't anywhere near this beast."
Thanks to bilco for the bottle. 
"Damn this smells amazing. Lots of dank, resinous hop oil. Lots of orange peel, tangerine and grapefruit. Touch of sweetness to round out everything. Minimal malt backbone, a touch dry."
A bit too sharp for my taste
"10/15/18 batch, updated rating and review... .my Prior rating was 4.7, this was the first trillium beer I ever had and it opened my eyes to the unique flavors that hops can impart on a beer."
"Bright orange, sticky head. Smells like sweet orange, mango, pineapple, and dank hops. Tastes are the same as the scent with a great balance of sweetness from the fruit flavors and the bitterness from the hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel and hidden alcohol. Great beer."
"Another excellent beer from Trillium, this one pours a thick, hazy yellow and smells softly of stone fruits. To the tongue, the peach and nectarine are most prevalent, but there is a little more of a citrusy taste underlying it. The milky texture and grainy undertones prevent this from being too fruity."
"Wife Picked-up a four-pack at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty bucks. Guessing she didn't notice the 9+ ABV. Pretty smooth, considering the ABV, a bit dank, nice brew."
The heaviest of mettle
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/15/18. Served in a Trillium-branded tulip. #properglassware"
This DIPA changed my life. Hoping for a 2018/2019 release soon...
Canned 11/21/17.
Just an enormously hopped beer that blows beyond what my finicky palate can handle these days. Carry on and pick up the info you seek from a more hop-headed review.
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy orange color with creamy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour is complete.
Golden and hazy with no visible carbonation. Topped with a finger of yellowish head.
"If I wanted to impress Amanda Kerr, if she said, “Raul, bring me the best haze you got...” I would not hesitate, and I’d go straight for Heavy Mettle. Hella robust tropical fruits on the nose and tongue; but all greeted by that oh-so-familiar dry, pithy aftertaste. Again, the last part is not for Raul, but he defends your right to love it. Cheers."
Poured to a teku glass.
"Great color, lots of carbonation, some floaters (which was unusual given the freshness of the can), but TONS of flavor that really punches you right in the mouth. AWESOME!!"
"An extremely smooth DIPA. Slightly malty, tropical notes with leche notes in the back."
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.
"Hazy orange pour with slight head and nice lacing .... smells of passion fruit, pineapple, mango and light orange ... tastes of all the same with little boozy bite at the end.... at 9.3 you’d never know based on taste.... dangerously tasty beer"
Pours a dark orange color. Completely opaque and quite hazy. Thin white head dissipates leaving a thin ring of white foam along the outside of the beer. No lacing. 
"This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color reminiscent of honey. There is a two finger, creamy white head with average retention for the style. It leaves some spots and patches of lacing on the glass."
Canned 11/21. Luscious orange-yellow color with a creamy 2 finger head. 
Golden opaque with cloudy fluffy head. Persist for a while leaving minimal lacing.
Fresh can from the Canton brewery. Super hazy yellow. Great hoppy aroma. Juicy flavor. Overall this was a very tasty double IPA an the alcohol was not overpowering in the flavor.
Serving: Can
"look: cloudy soft yellow, smell: sweet, bubblegum taste: surprisingly soft, actually sweet taste , overall smooth for a great ipa with 9.3 abv - everyone should try this one"
Look- OJ and Pineapple Juice. Hazy with a nice brightness too it. Very similar to DDH Melcher Street
"32 oz growler filled at the brewery, tasted same day"
"Very decent drinking beer, wheat aspect significant. Good hoppy taste. Slightly over the two month canning date, should have a bit more bold flavour. Buffalo trading partner."
"A 12 oz can dated Aug 31, 2017 poured into a snifter."
"First of all, absolutely beautiful pour! Hazy. Great foam head. Not picking up a great smell. Just very faint. Nitpicking. Great beer! Galaxy hops, love it! You would never guess this has such a high ABV! Delicious!"
Light color with a nice fruity aroma and smallish head. Light on alcohol presence. Touching on fuller sticky body with had a pleasing hop heavier aroma. Smooth and too easy to drink as I wanted it to warm more before finished it.
Just freekin' great brew.
Had on tap at the brewery
The 4th beer purchased at the Canton brewery. 16Oz can poured into a Trillium tulip. Definite citrus nose and Pineapple color is followed by a predominately Grapefruit taste. This beer was slightly less desirable than the other 3 because of the bitterness of the grapefruit.
"This a really delicious. Great aroma, big tropical fruit flavor and a really nice body. This a really smooth and crushable for a 9% beer. Another great beer from trillium."
This ones a doozy. Strong galaxy dank grapefruit nose and flavor. My favorite trillium for sure.
L - Murky body with a slightly dark orange color and a finger of white head
"Vibrant, cloudy, dark yellow with an orange tint. Two-plus fingers of yellow-tinted white head. Decent lacing."
"Don't think it was possible for this brew to fail me and it didn't - another legit world-class NEIPA from Trillium, this one featuring Galaxy and Amarillo hops in addition to their standard Columbus hop - and coming in at 9.3% abv, a heavy hitter for the brewers from Boston... My first grab of this beer was same day brewery fresh, meaning my 8/31/17 canning was the same day I bought and consumed it... Super green and taut - lots of unripe, bitter fruit impressions - really grabbed the palate and never let go... Bitter in a vegetal/fruit kinda way, mildly sweet, moderately carbonated, and medium-light feel... Instant classic..."
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky pale yellow with white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is robust with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Grapefruit, melon, orange and some resin on nose. Taste is incredibly well balanced. Starts with fruity notes of orange, melon, peach, grapefruit and then finishes with some pine and resin. Incredible imperial IPA."
"Lighter opaque orange pour, smaller head, small specks of lace. Resinous aroma and taste, lighter grapefruit, citrus rinds, grains, fairly sweet and somewhat subdued comapared to other trilliums. Medium body with an oily mouthfeel."
16 oz can. Big flavorful tropical DIPA with only light malt character and a good bit of hop punch. Almost no booze for such a big brew. Light slick mouthfeel.
Don't get the hype over this one. I was very excited to try based on the ratings. In my opinion this is one of the worst Trillium I've had. Way too boozy and bitter
"this one definitely has a bite vs. the regular Mettle. Very strong, almost like a barleywine. like most trillium beers, is has a great look and mouth feel. this one's great after a long week:)"
Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 4/10/17.
Thank you Doug537 for this
"I would sum this beer up with this quote"" don't fix what's not broken!"" Very strong hoppy flavor and rather strong going down."
Milky yellow with a white foam.
"Canned 04/10/17, pours cloudy gold orange color which looks like grapefruit juice that has a 1-2 finger foamy white head that was full of bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving good spotty lacing as it went down. Had a second can this evening and the lacing retention was much better."
"Pours hazy orange with a big white head that fades slowly as clings to the sides of the snifter with great lacing. Aroma of orange peels and pineapple. Taste follows the nose with peach, mango light biscuit tone finish. Great DIPA from trillium. Looking forward to crushing more from them."
"The beer looks like a standard New England IPA. Light yellow color with the cloudiness you expect. There was very little head, however. What head was there was white and dissipated quickly."
"On-tap in Canton. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a 1/8th inch off-white head that dissipates towards the edges forming a creamy slick across the surface. The beer was served a bit cold so I was only able to get subdued notes of citrus, biscuit malts and an earthy quality. Taste follows nose - citrus was a bit more evident in the flavor profile. There were also some earthy/herbal qualities expressed towards the finish. Mouthfeel was light-medium in body with a bright carbonation. Overall, solid but a disappointing. I've ben wanting to try this beer for a while; however, it wasn't particularly distinctive."
"Looks like pineapple juice, minimal head"
On tap at canton
"Very nice beer...lighter orange color that is slightly cloudy. Smooth tasting, citrus more than orange...but its strong 9.3%...you only need one of these. I would get this again without question...seek this one out"
"My first hoppy Trillium, poured from the can into my Trillium Sevilla glass."
"Cloudy, light yellow pilsner color. Aroma smacks you in the face with pineapple, orange, apricot, a bit of nectarine and passion fruit. Smells absolutely amazing. The taste is OJ with pineapple, various fruitiness. Bitter is barely there, but it sticks around. Citrus sticks around for a bit on the tongue, the barely there bitterness is there with it. Crisp and nicely carbonated. The body mostly dry and a bit of hop oil coats your taste buds. 9.3%? I would of guessed more like 6-7% if I didn't read the can. Stupid good for that ABV, this is coming from someone who likes lower ABV and sessions. Just an incredible beer, would buy it all the time if I could."
Canned on 19 Jan 2017.
"reminds me of swish in color and in taste. Also taste similar to Brux IPA from Rushing Duck. Overall really solid DIPA. A lot of citrus, grapefruit undertones. Overwhelming citrus but somehow it all works. Well done"
"Wow, awesome brew right here. I love Trillium and feel fortunate to be close enough that I get to enjoy it regularly. I am a big fan of Mettle so when a buddy offered me one of these I was all over it and it did not let me down. Super tasty/juicy - not boozy at all just full of flavor and super smooth. Won't blow you away on the first sip but its such a well done and balanced brew you'll appreciate it more with each mouth full. Outstanding beer."
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Bottom of can says 01/19/17.
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 01/19/2017) into a Aslin Beer house glass. 
"Look-Color is an opaque, pinkish orange (looks just like grapefruit juice)."
Pours super thick with a citrusy flavor yet a dry finish that keeps you wanting more. A lot of Galaxy hops which I love. Definitely a great beer to have over and over again.
16oz can.
"If we're being honest, I was getting a little bored of Trillium's offerings towards the end of last year. Like many here, I found my palate was less and less wowed with each hop bomb as they all blend into that dominantly hazy, tropical and vinous taste before finishing dry. I wasn't complaining, but I wasn't wowed. This last month, however, has been like a new leaf. Pow Pow, DDH Congress/Stillings, Pinot Gris Dialed In... and now this huge return. I must say expectations were massive going in here. After a seven month wait, I knew the Trill boys must have really honed this one in. And fucking hell did they. "
"From a growler. Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color, with 1/4inch head. Taste is big pineapple, mango, and light orange rind. Heavy bodied, juicy with slight bitterness, medium-low carbonation. Reminds me a lot of Tree House's Very Green. An amazing, dank, juicy sipper. I think I prefer regular Mettle more, but this is in my top five Trillium IPAs. Well worth seeking out."
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip, taken from notes"
Definitely stronger than mettle. Regular hop smell but the taste was super dank and hoppy. Almost has a sense of a pineapple and hops coming together for a nice smooth taste.
S: Melon bomb. Sharp grapefruit. Pine resin. Sweet ripe citrus. Dank grass. Subdued stone fruit. Bubblegum.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Not much nose on this but tastes really nice. Wicked smooth for the ABV and is insanely drinkable. Not my favorite from them but definately a great beer offering.
This is the perfect DIPA.
"This was my first introduction to New England style IPA beers, and it was an amazing first! It was also my first ever Trillium. This beer is such a beautiful crafted piece of heaven! The smell just pops, the flavor is so good, you don't want to swallow it. I could not even imagine how fantastic an IPA, a double IPA at that, could taste! My co-worker Chris told me about Trillium when I was leaving PA to visit MASS for work training. I am glad he did! I have been back to Trillium once more since June 2016!"
"Pour: haziest ever, little head, "
"Every monday I do a bottleshare with my friends and this kept getting pushed back. It sat in the fridge for like 2 months. my 1500th unique beer on untapp'd was in sight and I decided to make it special, so I had Heavy Mettle and drank it all myself. I'm glad I did. Its easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. I put it right up there with Hill Farmstead Double Galaxy or Double Citra, Other Half Green Diamonds, Tired Hands Milkshake. Its a PINEAPPLE JUICE BOMB. Its dank in the best way! If pirates drank beer instead of rum, this would be their beer. its AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm in love! Mouthfeel is great. Its easy to drink. Its balanced and has great flavor. 5 BIG ASS STARS. Trillium, Can I have a job at your brewery and learn how you make such great beer (I'm serious. I want to learn from the best. PM me). This rocks my world. People say how TH makes great IPA's, but TH has NOTHING on this brew-NOTHING! FANTASTIC!"
"Smell is mango, pineapple, orange citrus, a hint of passionfruit, and a hint of stone fruit. Taste is orange, mango, honeysuckle, and a nice bitterness. This hides the 9.3% abv very well - it's very smooth and the tropical fruit and bitterness complements each other nicely."
Very cloudy orange color. I had stored the bottle laying down and some sediment accurate D around the opening. My have contributed to the cloudiness and extract. Still a wonderful peach mango smell with a balanced juicy bitter taste. Very full feel and pleasant carbonation.
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Huge tropical fruit, elite mouthfeel, a bit of sweetness but no apparent alcohol at 9.3%. My favorite Trillium offering to date!"
"My second Trillium tasting in as many weeks - this one was a solid DIPA with the usual beautiful look/outstanding smell. Now having several Trilliums under my belt, I'd say this one is very tasty, but not at the very top."
"Thanks to SadMachine for this bottle, as I try to ferret out the appeal of this newish brewery. 750ML bottle split with my wife. And I dig the labels - reminds me of 1776 Boston for some reason. "
Poured the typical orange juice-like Trillium IPA look. Cloudy and opaque. 
"750ml bottle, dated 6.15.16, poured into a Trillium snifter glass. "
"Poured hazy orange, as with every Trillium IPA, with fruity citrus aromas of grapefruit, mango, etc. Not a huge hop bite, but nice and smooth. Very easy to drink and good hop flavors."
"750 mL bottle. Hazy orange body. Smells of grapefruit, garlic, a little tropical, and some pale malt sugars. Tastes of garlic and grapefruit. Pretty boozy. Moderate sweetness. Grapefruit and bitter finish. Medium heavy. Pretty easy to drink for its size. Still an imposing IPA."
"Definitely a tart grapefruit citrus flavor from the hops. Very hazy in appearance. A nice white bubbly head. The mouthfeel is good. This is a tasty strong IPA, but not above and beyond what I have access to locally now."
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for the hookup
"Pale gold, resembling pineapple juice ."
Yellowish pineapple juice appearance. Cloudy.
Big fan! Trillium has a special DNA that no one else comes close to. Sets the brewery apart from the rest.
This beer is amazing. Nearly no bitterness huge hop flavor very heavy and very aromatic. If I had to find one thing it would be its a bit to hot on the alcohol presence. And quite difficult to finish by yourself. But outstanding none the less. Another fantastic pale from trillium
Bottled 6/15/16
"bottle dated 6/15/16. pale milky yellow color with a dense white head, nice retention and a bit of lacing. "
"Hazy yellow body with a half inch of white head. Juicy appearance. Aromas of melon, pineapple, assorted tropical citrus. Sublime. Subtle sweetness and tangy, juicy, fruit. A showcase of fresh hops. Delicious."
bomber poured into chalice
"Three weeks old, poured from a bomber into a 23 ounce tulip glass. Lots of pineapple, melon, and orange on the nose, Nice white fluffy whip cream head that lasts a while and converts into beautiful lacing through the entirety of the beer. Nice orange creamy look and mouth feel, perfect amount of bitterness and dry on the finish. A nice amount of booze and resin flavor, a beautiful tasting double IPA. This is an underrated trillium beer."
6/15/16 bottling date; 10 days old
Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a pint glass. Thanks Steve for hooking me up with this one. 
"Peach colored orange with a small white head but great lacing. Aromas of fruity hops consume you, very aromatic. Notes of overripe peaches, mango, grapefruit pulp, light pine and dank herbaceous green stuff. Fuller medium feel, creamy, coating and a touch dry. This is a glorious example of a fruit hoppy soaked resiny DIPA. Stunning beer."
"Appearance is straight pinapple juice, murky-golden, with a finger of head. Smell is pineaplle with mango and peach with some orange and spice. Taste follows tropical fruit with some citrus and yeast spice. The feel is pretty much perfect for 9.3, full with solid carbonation, makes the beer taste even better. Another spectacular beer from Trillium. Super flavorful and perfect mouthfeel, together makes for an experience, one to remember."
"Looks like OJ, tastes like heaven. Great juicy notes w a full mouthyfeel. Great DIPA, glad I went to the orig brewery in Boston too..great nook, but no tasting."
"huge beer, pours a murky yellow, head dissipates quickly into ring. pungent smell fills the room as soon as it's poured. smell is oranges, pineapples, and a little bit of pine. taste is big sweet oranges, peach, pineapple, with a little bit of an earthy note at the end. feel was almost perfect, I would have preferred a little more fuzz. another knock out DIPA from the best."
"Light orange and hazy appearance. Aroma is orange candy, pineapple, lime, mint, melon, passion fruit. Taste is sweet orange, passion fruit, key lime. Tastes like juice. Slightly bitter and herbal notes. Mouth feel is full and creamy with good carbonation. The abv adds a nice weight to this beer but it never gets too boozy but it is a little too sweet. Great beer."
Lots of pineapple and tropical notes. A great beer.
Great beer. Their DIPAs are just a bit too boozy for me. DDH Pales are the winners at Trillium
Very drinkable for a 9.3% DIPA. Looks like a hazy dark gold orange juice. Taste has hints of tropical citrus. Excellent beer but possibly a little over hyped.
This beer crushes it. Amazing citrus nose. Super thick mouthfeel for an IPA. Absolutely tremendous. My favorite trill for sure.
"Look - That hazed, juice like appearance "
One of the best IPA's I've ever tasted. Just the perfect amount of hoppiness. Can barely tell its nearly 10%. Pleasantly fruity aftertaste. Definitely one of my favorites from them.
750ml bottled on 05/03/16
"Wow! Pours a golden orange hue, hazy but not opaque. Great lacing and 1/2 finger white head. Smell is cantaloupe, papaya, mango and tangelos. Taste follows, sweet, resiny, sticky, hoppy and bursting with tropical fruit and ripe melon. Great mouthfeel. Would drink this every day if I could"
Favorite IPA beer from TBC and I don't think it is close.
Poured from a 750ml bottle into tulip glasses:
"A: Very hazy, finger of white head which leaves behind some impressive lacing. If you poured this into a ""normal"" drinking glass without any head I could see myself mistaking this for a glass of juice."
This is not my favorite Trillium beer and the hops are not over the top vs. the DDH beers but this is such an easy drinking beer that totally covers up the 9.3%. You will drink this beer quickly and then realize what you just have done.
"My favorite beer. Accordingly, I'd probably disregard everything I'm about to say, because I'm too emotional to be taken seriously. This beer is possessed of towering, stupid fruit, y'all; a hazy, luminous monster, crowding the glass at the juice zoo. Hot-house orange nectar sweet meets hot-boxing-your-friends'-mom's-station-wagon bitter, and has a fight, a dumb fight, over which one is best and they both win."
Bottled 5/3/2016. You dudes remember Mettle? Meet its kicked-up older brother.
5/3/2016 bottle drank in a trillium chalice on 5/14/2016
"Poured from a 64 oz growler into a tulip glass with about a fingers worth of head which settles down into a soft glaze on top. Appearance is so cloudy, hazy, and thick with a nice orange juice colored hue. The nose on this beer pops out as soon as the cap is twisted like a dank cloud! Hints of sappy pine, summer fruit like ripe nectarines and peaches jump out along with some ripe melon. The nose may be the best part of this beer, and that's not to slight the taste portion, it just really catapults into your nose like not many others. "
Grabbed a growler. Three days old.
"One of my favorite Trillium offerings. Right from the start with the nose, this was a winner. Great balance between a juice bomb and subtle hint of darkness."
Pours an opaque golden orange color with a small white head. Leaves some nice cobweb lacing. 
Bottlred on 4/3/16; drank on 4/4/16 (Star Wars Day) in a teku glass
"Pours very hazy, pale orange in color with a finger of white head that dissipates rather quickly. Looks a heck of a lot like orange juice. Love the aroma but find it a bit lacking in intensity. I get citrus mostly in the form of tangerine but there is some grapefruit there as well; I also get supporting notes of tropical fruits with mango most prominent. There is a hint of alcohol as the beer warms. Taste mirrors the aroma but the flavors are far more subtle. Nectarine, peach, mango, grapefruit, and subtle alcohol notes. Good mouthfeel, medium body, fairly soft mouthfeel. Overall a very good beer. I really enjoy this brew, it's very enjoyable but I found the aromas and flavors to be a bit subdued."
Fresh at less than a month old. Light golden hue with a great hop aroma. Very balanced and super smooth all around. First class beer
Tasting notes from from a bottle consumed in November 2015
Another brilliant Trillium offering! As usual very hop forward and not too bitter of a finish! Just perfect! Loads of juicy fruity hops!!
"Trillium doesn't make the prettiest beers, but the make up for it in every other category. This is one of may favorites."
A: Pours a deep and slightly murky copper color with a 1/2 finger off white head and tons of lace.
L- semi hazy yellow. actually both lighter and clearer than i expected. foggy but not dense. head is white and strong with thick lacing as it subsides. 
750 ml bottle was poured into a snifter glass. 
"A: Hazy, gold in color with a thin, white, soapy head that dissipates fairly quickly."
"Considering the obnoxious amount of hops they crammed into this beast of a IIPA it pours surprisingly clear relative to the DDH series. Nose is a slap of resinous pine and lemon peel. Super dank characteristics that you don't see too often in Trillium pales. Tastes of ripe lime zest, some dried tropical fruits, and more of that resinous pine, almost leaves the lips a little sticky. Pretty dry, almost too dry but I'd rather that than it being overly sweet. Another quality offering but far from their best work, I'll take DDH anything over this in a heartbeat."
Awesome nose. Very fresh hops.
Trillium really knows their IPAs. Big citrus aroma. Big citrus taste. Hops hit you in the face at Impact but are then countered expertly with a sweet malty backbone. I'd drink this all the time if I had the opportunity. This ranks right up there with heady IMO.
"December 29th, 2014 batch in 1pt 6oz Bottle"
"This is an absolutely exceptional beer. Just amazing. Drinks like 5% so need to be careful. So many DIPAs tend toward heavy body and over- / unbalanced hop bitterness and you don't want more than 1 glass. This beer is nectar. Lovely, cloudy pale color with complex nose and light but lively feel on the palate. Finish is surprisingly delicate for strong IPA but flavorful and balanced. This is an exceptionally masterful ale from an exceptional brewery. Cheers Trillium!"
"IMO, the best IIPA in the country. The smell is loaded with dank notes, but also loaded with tons of tropic fruits. The taste is smooth and juicy. What an amazing brew"
Beautiful beer. One of the best DIPA in New England
A: My idea of the perfect looking Ipa. Super cloudy pale yellow with a nice big white head on pour and amazing lacing. Leaves a trace all the way down the glass as you drink it.
Bottle shared by Curran tonight.
"Strikes a bold, yet delicate, balance. Citrus (particularly grapefruit) along with pronounced tropical fruit (particularly pineapple), and a wonderfully clean, yet firm, bitterness that washes it down. Delectably creamy mouthfeel. Killer Mettle, bruh."
"Bottle from @jbwimer dated 12/29/14, poured 1/16/15. Thanks buddy! Pours super cloudy bright yellow, hideous color, with a beautiful fluffy white head that sticks around forever. Sticks all over the glass. I have it a higher score than it might deserve thank a to the head and he fact that the overall wasn't high enough with the score I think the look of this thing deserves. Aroma of pineapple and grapefruit, a bit of pine tree, some sweet honey notes, but mostly just the tropical piney hops going on here. Flavor is nearly indistinguishable from pineapple grapefruit juice, in a good way. Lightly sweet malts but in a way that completely highlights the hop flavors with some light tropical sweetness to go along. Bitter up front and all the way through but in a way that is very smooth, supported by the interestingly creamy mouthfeel. Despite that creaminess, this is insanely light and drinkable with basically zero alcohol flavor. Dropped this way too quickly. Good stuff and definitely unique."
"Hazy sunshine in the glass. Mineral and tangerine nose, which predominates tastewise as well.Nice straw notes with a significant, but not unbalanced hop bite. Overall, extremely well-balanced with a flavor profile reminiscent of a HF IPA. Trillium makes some great hoppy offerings."
12/29/2014 Bottle
I think that the bottle that was opened was not completely fresh
"One of My favorite Trillium IPAs. So juicy. I wish that they brewed this more often. TYpical cloudy trillium visual. The aroma is amazing, masks the high alcohol well. Taste is splendid, as is mouthfeel. If you can find it, drink it!"
Bottle poured and domed from a HF Balloon Glass
Served in a snifter from a 750 mL bottle. 
"smells delicious, tastes delicious yet you get hit with kind of a bitter/sour after taste that brings this beer down"
Bomber into a Sam Adams glass. Didn't share with anyone ;-)
Bottled 12/29/14 (3 days ago).
Cloudy yellow pour. Head dissolves quickly. Floral citrus aroma. Grapefruit on the tongue. Delicious. Well worth the trip
Heavy Mettle pours a hazy straw yellow with a small creamy white head on top. The aroma is dank with notes of tropical fruit and pine.
"Poured into a Sam Adams IPA glass. Hazy orange, almost Hef like appearance. Smell is all pine and citrus hops. Taste is the smell plus dankness, granted this was bottled 2 days prior. Dinging them for mouthfeel, light to me compared to Heady Topper, although def giving them a run for there $$. Find/Trade for this beer when fresh!!!"
Incredible beer. Mettle on steroids with extra Galaxy!
"Really big tropical fruit nose with pineapple and mango. Nice orange body with a big fluffy white head. The taste is fruity on the front end. You get juicy mango and some sweetness of citrus. The finish is caramelized pineapple and booze. The booziness intensifies as this warms. The flavor is a bit disjointed for me, and the alcohol burn on the end got to me. Nice scent and opening flavors, but the finish is harsh for such a large bottle of beer."
Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle acquired in an in-person trade with muzzy
It's kind of overrated. Terrible after taste.
750ml bottle dated 8/16/2014. Poured into a Lawson's snifter 8/28/2014 at 40F.
"A - 1.5 inches of dense, white head. Great lacing. OK head retention. Hazy, deep golden-orange body."
"Really stoked about this one! Loved Mettle, so Heavy Mettle is a must try. Pours a murky yellow (just how I like it) with a thock, white crown. Blobs and globs of lace. The nose is magnificent. Puréed fruit juice hops. Zesty, tropical fruit hops, passion fruit some moss and a tad if green onion. Chunks of mango. Very impressive. The hoppiness is incredibly intense. Starts with a huge passion fruit zap along with melon and mango. Guava. I believe they used Galaxy hops and they shine! Hints of grass and moss. Citrus and nectarine. Dry, pale malt. Fruit juice elixir. Hops are stunningly intense. Flavor lasts for days. Surprisingly not ridiculously bitter. Hop-oil feel. No booze. Sneakily drinkable. Trillium is vaulting into legendary status and this may be their best one yet. What a brilliant, modern Imperial IPA."
"I think Mettle is one of the finest Imperial IPAs released in the last 3 years. However, Heavy Mettle - while good - isn't on the same plane."
Bottled yesterday......
"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a willibecher. This was bottled yesterday, picked up from the brewery an hour ago."
"Upper Case pours a thick, murky orange juice yellow with a small, 1-finger ivory white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell has a big tropical fruit aroma with orange, mango and grapefruit with a big bite of danky hop resin. The taste is sweet candied fruit inducing pineapple, mango and good dose of citrus zest with a creamy goodness from the raw wheat. A complex bitterness creeps in finishing rather sticky. Overall, this is a very solid NE style DIPA. Another great beer out of Trillium brewing. Cheers!"
Thanks Kevin
"Draught pour at The Smoke Shop. Nose is mute (opens up a bit once warm) , but the taste explodes with tropical fruit, papaya, guava, passion fruit, mango, kiwi, and some faint citrus. Creamy feel on the tongue and swallow, some ABV burn that drys the palate. Damn delicious brew, just wanted more from the nose."
Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing.
"One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Went to Trillium over the weekend and tried all the beers on the tap line including Upper Case. Along with Permutation 52 (mentioned in other review), this was my favorite beer of the bunch. All the others were amazing too (including Meddle at a close runner up), but this one had more complex flavors and smell. A great NE IPA style, very juicy, and very smooth for the ABV level. I live in NYC and can say this stacks up very well with some of our favorites from Other Half, Sand City, LIC, etc."
Wow! Full on blast of overripe mango& pineapple w/ slightly tart resin finish. Extremely slick and thick. Carbonation bursts on my tongue. Outstanding Beer
"Canned 7/17/18, so a week and a half ago. "
"Had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since I threw a bunch of brews his way for a party. When you open the can, it doesn't just greet you with an aroma, it jumps out and punches you in the face. The flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness. It's hard to describe all the flavors since it's like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion: really fucking loud. I get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin. Mosaic plays the lead role with Galaxy as an obvious supporting job. Serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed, but I never got any booze heat or warmth. Overall this is my favorite Trillium to date with Galaxy Cutting Tiles coming in a close second."
"Oddly enough, this beer is exactly as they described it. Thick, beautiful orange juice pour, Doughy mouthfeel, and loads of papaya, mango, pineapple, and doughy yeastiness. Very well hidden 9%. Really loved this. Very recommended."
"Canned yesterday, the day I picked it up at the brewery, 12/21/17"
"I enjoyed this beer, especially the nose. The nose promised bright floral hop perfection, but after taking it on I expected the taste to be different. It is more earthy than I expected. It is a great dipa, but the taste does not invite the next sip as well as other excellent IPAs I've had from this fine brewer."
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruit with lemon. Taste is moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of lemon, mango, melon, pineapple, resin, caramel. As almost all of Trilliums beer very well done."
Canned 6/5/17; drank 7/20/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Getting lots of mango, papaya, pineapple, some pine. All on top of a nice pilsner presence, with some fresh baked bread and wheat. Hop oils in full force, it coats your mouth aggressively, but with barely any unpleasant bitterness. This one is top class."
"L: cloudy yellow, quickly dissipating head, some lacing"
"Had on tap at the Trillium beer garden on the Greenway. Nice, full aromas and flavors that lean towards the fruity pungency of Galaxy and Mosaic. At 9% ABV and $20/4-pack of 16oz cans, this is Trillium's 'best value' DIPA. "
Look is cloudy dark stew colored with 2 fingers of slightly off white head.
Turbid apricot hues. Finger tall head that recedes onto an ever present ring. 
16oz can dated 6/17/17.
"Look: Yellow, hazy, with 3 inch fluffy head."
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is under-ripe mango, light orange juice, and dry white wine. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and slightly bitter...Makes for a good IPA by Trillium's standards...great IPA by most standards..I will get this one again, but middle of the pack in Trillium's incredible spectrum of ipas."
"Hazy orange pour, looks like a ""street"" style Trillium beer"
Mosaic everywhere. Dangerously easy to drink
16 oz can. Dis le best beer I've ever had. Literally. Might move to Boston because of it.
22oz bottle poured into a tulip
Not much head formed and it is white and gone quickly. Smells of ripe fruit and malts. Thick like fruit juice. Great tastes of hopps and tropical fruit. Very good beer.
thanks to SquirrelsBrews
"Pours out a hazy golden orange, but not totally turbid/murky."
Canned 10/31
"Look: golden orange, thick creamy 2 inch head"
"Proteins and particulate matter floating in this beer, looks like it was conditioning in the can."
Great fruity smell on this one. Almost a passion fruit smell. Very smooth and hoppy taste. Great orange look. Perfect body. Piney taste comes through strong on the end of this one.
"Hazy orange with a moderate, fluffy white head and some clingy arms of lace dying to a thin blanket."
"Lucky to have had an Upper Case before a Curiosity 27. But, glad I didn't go in the reverse direction. Upper Case is at 9% ABV, way above my comfort zone, and I can taste it. If I were going to be drinking a double IPA, this would be my limit....what a nice limit it is!"
Look: Hazy golden orange with a persistent white head. Very active. 
"A: Deep yellow, hazy, 2 fingers of white foam, decent lacing"
"This is a phenomenal beer. The aromatics never dissipate and are led by mosaic. It smells like candied apricots and mango. One thinks it's going to taste too sweet, but it finishes purely on the tongue with clean but wet richness. I get a wave of grapefruit followed by the stone fruit I mentioned. Amazing. I need more."
"Deep orange, hazy appearance. Maybe a bit 'older' than it should have been but the essence of this beer was noticeable. Loads of orange and mango on the nose and in the taste. Sweet malts come in the back, which I would imagine aren't as obvious when fresh because it seemed to have started to drop off. None the less, despite all that, a very good DIPA from Trillium."
"Phenomenal. Wow. Out of the park. Hops for days, depth of character most dipas can only dream of. Tropical fruit and citrus intermingled with dank. Tastes the way the best marijuana smells hands down. Morning, day and night."
I didn't plan on giving this a perfect score but I really couldn't think of any way that a DIPA could be better. They nailed it. Turbidity be damned. This shit is good.
"Smell is passionfruit, mango, orange citrus, and a bit of stone fruit. Taste is mango, orange peel, passionfruit, a hint of dankness, and nicely blended hop bitterness. I think I prefer Trillium's double IPA offerings to some of their flagship ""Street"" beers."
"Overall one of the lesser Trilliums that I've had. Upper Case is still a delicious DIPA, but given the fierce competition it faces from its brothers, it just doesn't hold up as well."
Another delicious hoppy beer from Trillium. The biggest difference here from other Trillium DIPA's is that this beer is not as much of a juice bomb. Upper case has more bitterness and dry characteristics about it than most Trillium hoppy beers. Still fantastic beer non-the-less.
I love Trillium and most of their offerings. This beer is just a little too big. The nose is even a little boozy with a touch of citrus. The ABV is all over the tongue and interferes with the hops. Decent DIPA.
A slightly old by some folks standards 25.4oz bomber dated 5/18/16 was poured into a large tulip. The first bottle that I had a lot closer to bottle date of this was not my favorite offering from trill. 
06/23/16 bottling
One of the few beers from Trillium that I have been lucky enough to try. Probably the best though. Smells amazing and tastes every bit as good. Very fruity but not like a fruit juice. Want more!
Look is yellow orangey gold. Smells of pineapple and fruity goodness. Taste is Light with no alcohol taste despite the strength. Not very bitter and super balanced with a slight hint of citrus. It feels juicy going down. Excellent NE IPA.
"Decent, but I thought this was a bit on the boozy side. My friend picked this up from the Canton location, but I could not find a bottle date. It did not seem super fresh. I enjoyed the Launch Beer he brought back more."
"this smells and tstes more like an almost-watered-down cocktail, it has so much mango and pineapple and tropical notes in it. almost like a vodka and orange juice, with some alcohol detectable, but nowhere near the 9%. unbelievable stuff!"
Beer pours a hazy pale orange. Very little head with minimal lacing. 
"750ml bottle, stamped 06.23.16, poured into a Trillium snifter glass. "
"I have been spoiled and have had lots of Trillium, this was one of my least favorite. The hop profile was not as good to me and it was not as juicy. Still good, just not great"
Bottle dated 6/23/16. Poured into Lawson's tulip glass.
"A six-week old bottle, but still held up well. Less hazy than I was expecting. If it was this good after six weeks, I would be very interested in trying a fresh bottle."
This is my favorite of all of the Trillium beers I have had. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose. Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange. This beer is so smooth can't believe it's 9%.
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy orange, finger white head fades leaving rings of lace. Dank but juicy/fruity aroma. Sweet cracker malt and dank hops come together almost perfectly, so delicious. Undertones of tropical fruit, pineapple. Just so much flavor in their IPAs."
"Tropical fruit bomb, great mouth feel, a little too heavy on the mosaic hops for me."
"Whoa. This might be my favorite Trillium beer and thats really saying something. Awesome hop varietals, Mosaic, Citra and Galaxy are my holy trinity for juicy IPA's. Lots of pineapple and mango in this bad boy and I cant believe this is 9%, it's scary easy to drink"
Opaque honey color with very little head
Bomber purchased in Canton. Poured into a tulip glass. Strong hit of hops as soon as the bottle opens. Floral aroma . Cloudy appearance like most Trillium IPAs. Smooth finish.
"pours much less hazy than a standard trillium beer, head is foamy but dissipates quick, nice lacing as always. smell is big mosaic: earthy, citrusy, and pineapple, a little pine at the end. taste is exactly the smell notes, just much bigger, almost no malt. no booze taste despite being up there. feel is nice and fuzzy. another killer DIPA from Trill."
"Pours a hazed golden yellow color with a a nice white head that leaves behind streaks of lacing, smells of tropical fruit like mango and tangelo and sweet lemon grass, taste is tropical nice ripe hops with some garden dankness, mouth feel is fruity a touch of bitterness ABV well hidden with medium carbonation."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip - approximately two week old bottle. A bit boozy...much better as it warmed up as the tropical fruit really shined through. A solid offering from Trillium, but not one of my favorites."
Poured into a teku pint. Label says 5/18/16.
750ml bottle dated 05/18/16
Golden orange color. White head with lace.
Disappointed by this one.
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden orange (not cloudy like most Trillium beers) with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly. There are a few thin chunks of lacing. Smell is mango, pineapple, grapefruit, slight herbal dankness and some doughy malt. Taste is the same with a good deal of bitterness accompanying crackery malt on the finish. More bitter than other Trillium offerings. Feel is medium, starts off soft, but the prickliness from the bitterness cuts right through. Alcohol is very well hidden. Although not my favorite by them, overall this is another great beer from Trillium. What else is new?"
Bomber poured into pint glass
"Best double IPA I've had from Trillium, better than Mettle, Heavy Mettle, Scaled Up, and just better than Artaic. Really comprable to Julius"
Look - A beautiful deep golden color. Hazed but nowhere near the normal orange juice look. 
Another great ipa in a long line of great trillium IPAs. This fruit notes in this one are primarily a blend of orange and grapefruit.
Dark golden. Typical white head.
Pours a glowing golden color with some haziness. Aroma is hoppy tropical fruit. Flavor is mango and citrus with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. A touch of citrus peel on the back end. Mouthfeel clean and has a nice body. Overall really delicious double IPA.
I am loving this Trillium offering. As others have stated is is not as cloudy as the others but it is still not a clear beer. Has a nice sweet citrus nose and more of that on the palate. I really like citrus forward beers so this one is a winner. Wish I had bought more than one bottle.
"The amount if Tha KS I have that go out to my man Mike for this haul of trillium is endless. and upon the bottle oickup, why not pop one? enjoyed from a trill sherry glass. bottle dated 05/18/16 (8 days ago...BOOM)!"
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter. Thanks Steve for getting me this.
Poured from a 750ml bottle into tulips:
L: Warm golden and orange hues with a slight haziness (much less than the typical Trillium haze bomb) and ample white frothy head
Jesus what a beer. I get why this beer is hyped.
Look: Not as hazy as typical Trillium beers with a bright orange color and thin white head
Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a 1-finger white head. The head is gone in seconds but leaves a good bit of lacing.
Yet another excellent IPA from Trillium. Hazy orange color with decent head and excellent fruit and dank aromas on the nose. Drinks smooth with great mouth feel and tropical fruit flavors galore.
"Nice and cloudy on the pour. Almost a cider look to it. Aroma is sweet, juicy joy. Taste is mango and apricot. This is one of the best dipas I've ever had."
Bottle poured into snifter. Fresh. About 10 oz. pour.
Light golden color with a fluffy ass white head. You can see through it?!?! Weird! 
Another amazing offering from Trillium! Enjoyed with friends and poured into an 8 oz tulip. Tons of citrus and fruity hops explosion here!! Great stuff! Will keep tracking down all the trillium I can!!!
"The pour is a flaming peach color, nice and cloudy with a slight bone white head that retains well."
"Upper Case might be the best I've had from Trillium so far (close call between UC and Artaic). As usual, Trillium delivers an incredibly balanced DIPA with a soft mouthfeel and killer hop aroma. Incredibly drinkable at 9%."
This brewery is top notch and this beer is an amazing representation of the quality style they produce. Can't wait to get more soon. Trillium is legit!
L: light amber with a creamy head that impressively stays at a full finger after several sips
"Pours hazy orange with a two finger head. Smells of sweet tropical citrus, mango, with peppery notes and pine. Taste is grapefruit and orange with a spicy peppery mouth feel. Mosaic hops really shining through. Bitter big IPA packaged nearly and while it may taste slightly boozier than most Trillium offerings, you'd probably only be noticing it if you read the 9% alcohol content before your first sip. Excellent DIPA."
"Pours a hazy mango color with moderate head. Smell is extreme tropical fruit (passion fruit and citrus). Taste showcases the fruit, balanced with hop a slight hop bitterness and a little bit of malty sweetness. Flavors are exceptional and very well balanced. I really liked this one!"
L-nice bright orange with a thin white head
"Happened upon this one during last weekend's release. As a Tree House regular, this one definitely matched up with some of their offerings. Very aromatic and bursting with hoppiness flavor. Amazing beer!"
wow.. pours an orange opaque.. looks like orange juice.. this may be the best beer ever. its nose is perfect.. mouthfeel is so great... taste is phenomenal..
L- Bright Orange and hazy with a delicate white head
L- pours a bright orange with a small white head.
L - Unfiltered milkshake appearance of orange. Two fingers of white head.
64 oz. Growler poured into a tulip.
"Pours a hazy golden orange hue with bright white head. Like mango meat. It's totally opaque. Bursting with tropical aroma, in particular mangoes and tangerine. Not as tropical in taste as in the aroma. A little melon sweetness followed by a lot of limey citrus. It's got a little bit of the chalkiness that you also get in Congress St. The hop character is intense, which is typical with Trillium beers. It's a little boozy. Overall, it's an intense IPA, but is more citrusy than the tropical fruit character that I enjoy."
Bright golden body with a big grapefruit peel and pine needle scent. Huge piney flavor with a biting bitterness. A tad boozy on the finish. Very crisp and clean body in the west coast style.
"A: Cloudy/bright gold in color with a medium white head. Dissipates isn't a sticky, soap like lacing."
Thanks a bunch to my brother-in-law Kevin for gifting me this bottle. Trillium kills it.
I would add the picture for this one if I could upload. Another great Trillium beer.
A little bit of a hop bomb and pallet wrecker.
"From notes- Great DIPA, a little boozier, but the flavors shown through."
750 ml bottle was poured into a tulip glass. 
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
"Ridiculously good--- jumped over the high bar trillium has already set... uber-danky, hoppy, citrusy, and smooth... the only way this beer could be better is if it did my laundry--- well-done Trillium!"
"A- Medium golden body, hazy, one finger white head, nice retention, good lacing."
I'm not a fan of dank IPAs and this is very dank.
"Cloudy hazy yellowish pour with a 1 finger head. Juicy, fruity smell. Get a sweet tropical taste (mango and papaya) up front with a medium malt backbone and a nice resin hop finish. Another great beer."
"Golden yellow in color. Fairly hazy in appearance. Pineapple, mango, papaya and a hint of pine. Medium bodied. Dank and delicious. Extremely balanced."
Ooooo grapefruit notes come on strong with this one. 9% and the alcohol delivers a welcome bite. Crisp bitteri g finish. Trillium can knock a few balls over the green monster. Well done!
"Pour is golden yellow with lots of white head and moderate retention. Nose has a faint bready note with tons of tropical fruit hop aromas, grapefruit rind, and hints of melon. Flavor is super hoppy, tons of tropical fruits and rindy melons, a touch musky. Lighter body, a hint syrupy, assertive carb."
"My friend so graciously offered to share his bomber dated 3/26 with me. The smell that came out of the bottle let us know we were about to try something great. I actually have to rate this so slightly higher than the HFB Abner simply due to two simple facts... 1.) I have to go to the brewery or a tap room to give it a try (accessibility to bottles or cans is ""feel"" trait for me)... and 2.) have to give just slight props for such a great beer coming from the home state! "
"Yeah. This is a fantastic beer. It's a sneaky 9%, too."
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
"If you hover your mouth over the glass and just inhale, your mouth instantly starts watering. Super fruity, and then gives way to tons of complex hops flavors that are perfectly balanced. I'm not even a huge IPA fan but this is probably the best beer I've ever had."
"Huge thanks to yourefragile for sharing. Pale yellow transparent body wih a small white collar. What an aroma! Let me check again. Yep, that's a 5. Fabulous flavor as well. Super fresh hops. Tropical fruits abound. Medium bodied with a resinous finish. Moderate to high bitterness throughout. I am profoundly impressed with the few beers I have had from Trillium thus far. Wow."
Hands down one of the best Double IPAs ive ever had. I almost drank it through my nose it smelt so good. But finally i took a sip...
"Hazy honey yellow with a small creamy white head. Tropical fruit aroma. Full body. Dank citrus, mango, grapefruit. Dry bitter finish. Delicious."
"Along with Artaic, Trillium is going to take IPAs by storm (they kind of already are). This is an IPA all others should be judged on, with just a sweet enjoyable taste, a nose that will knock you over (in a good way) and just enough bite at the end to keep wanting more."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy, marmalade color. Thin, soupy head. Random, patchy lacing. Whoa. The aroma is absolute hop juice. The Mosaic hops pummel my nose. Some people don't enjoy the almost oniony quality of Mosaic, but I love it. It's also incredibly tropical-fruity. A previous reviewer cited descriptors such as ""cilantro and plant stems"" and they nailed it. Still, the tropical fruit medley is impressive. I get a ton of guava, mango and pineapple. The flavor explodes once it hits my tongue. Such a concentrated hoppiness. Elixir, extract, nectar. The green onion, cilantro and stem-spice of the Mosaic is in elite form. Galaxy, Citra and Columbus hops also add plenty of hoppy depth. Mango, papaya, pineapple and guava hop flavors. I get signature Citra flavor as well as a passion fruit/moss flavor combo that I equate with Galaxy. It's half tropical and half green. I really love when a hoppy brew can balance between those elements. The malt is signature Trillium dense pastry and sugar. It really props up the lupulin. Body is creamy and fairly full. Bitterness isn't necessarily searing. It lingers but doesn't obliterate. I enjoyed this beer a ton. Up there with Heavy Mettle and Fort Point in my book. It really reminds me of Dinner by Maine Beer. Maybe not for everyone but definitely fits my tastes."
"Hop Bomb, fruity and crisp with a nice lingering finish. well rounded, delicious beer. what a way to celebrate two years"
Cloudy/yellow with a medium white head.
"Hazy clementine-orange colour bursting with aromas of ""overripe"" mango, tangerine, and passion fruit. Taste has a light, sweet, and crisp Pilsner malt with some extremely fruity notes that are balanced very well by the grain, dry alcohol, and slight earthy pine. Delicious."
Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. This was bottled today.
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy amber color capped by a two-fingered head; slivers of lacing line the glass
"This beer wasn't as much of a hazy juice bomb compared to other trillium IPAs. I see this as a good thing, it is nice to see them switching it up a little. Huge mosiac smell. The other hops really balanced out the mosiac well, which is probably the thing i like most about this beer. There is some powerhouse hops in this beer but none of them overpowered eachother. I tasted a little more bitterness compared to other trillium beers which is another plus for me. Overall fantastic, one of my favorite offerings from one of my favorite breweries."
The beer comes in a completely hazy bright orange color.
"Not as cloudy as I have come to love of Trillium, and Heavy Mettle is still the best double they do, this is still amazing and was totally worth the wait. DRINK THIS!!!!!!!!!"
Poured from 750 ml bottle dated 3/17/2015. 
"March 17th 2015 bottle, opened 4 days later on March 21st 2015. "
Pretty solid beer! Nice hoppy taste to this beer! Had it in canned freshed and a pour that was stored for a few months in my cellar. Must admit this is an awesome brew; this brew has a nice Orange/Gold color to it; hoppy sweet smell; and some light foaming. Taste it smooth slightly carbonated feel to it but overall goes down smooth!
"Canned 10/15, so one week ago. "
Very cloudy straw appearance with moderate white head. Aroma is a strong citrus with some hoppyness. Taste is a grapefruit/citrus with some bitterness.
"At this point, there is like a brewery every 20 miles who makes elite tier hop goods. Its not ubiquitous, but its getting close. Along those lines, let's visit Monkish's almost flagship? Had this last year at the Eclipse party, I think someone from SBG brought it. Pours a yellow haze with 1/3"" white head. The aroma is all that proprietary hop tropical notes and marijuana strain one could want. Pineapple, sour bubba, guava, tangerine and pine. The dry hopping is very bigly. "
I haven't the foggiest. The original is better than the sequel.
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of peach, kiwi, tangerine, and dank herbs. It tastes of kiwi, peach, tangerine, and papaya. The feel is medium light and smooth. Another good IPA from Monkish."
Had it on tap at Monkish. Insane beer
Incredible. A must have.
Pours foggy peachy hazy cloudy lovely..
"From howler, after 5 days."
"Beautiful hazy peach with a medium white head. Aroma is fantastic with pineapple, mango, orange, and hints of white grape. Flavor follows. Overall awesome beer. Might prefer it a touch less sweet"
"Probably one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Not much to say on this that hasn't already been said. Smooth, fruity, refreshing. Great mouth feel. Just fantastic all around."
"16 oz can. Thisbrew smells like a tropical fruit dream, peach n pineapple. Tastes the same, fruity withjust a touch of piney resin in the end. Whoa!"
Hazy Yellow
Canned on 1.3.17 (Stay Soggy). Enjoyed on 2.7.17. Acquired in a trade for 1 Treehouse Haze.
"A nice measure of sweetness alongside the saturated hop nose, grapefruit and a touch of pineapple. Similar on the palate, less of a yeasty/green bite than a few of their other hoppy ales I tried, and better for it. A bit more interplay, as on the nose, with the grapefruit/pineapple, which keeps it from being too one-dimensional (though still not a particularly complex beer). Body is fine, properly weighted, though not especially fluffy, which I think is a requisite for this style to really work. Overall, a solid enough example of the haze craze."
Was lucky enough to get a nice pour of this from a flip top growler in Decorah at the C&C Share during TGs last release. Very nice DIPA with lots of hops and citrus fruit.
"The beer comes in a light gold color, extremely hazy like orange juice in a glass."
L: Warm hazy apricot and honeycomb hues with a healthy white foam head
Canned 1/3/17. Consumed 1/10/17.
This is the best NE style IPA ever brewed by a west coast brewery. Thanks Monkish.
"On tap at the brewery, poured as an 8oz in a rounded pint glass. "
"Hazy, milky orange."
"Wow. Just Wow. This is in the top 5 IPAs I have ever had... No Doubt. Super Jucy, Hazy and all those classic east coasty descriptors... Who needs to trade for NE Hops when I can drive 30 min?"
"THIS..... THIS is a perfect description! sorry for copying and pasting your review, dude, but this is dead f'ing on....."
Pours an incredibly beautiful hazy orange yellow with a frothy white head. I smelled this stuff from the can and just got an insane amount of tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is still very tropical fruit forward. Grapefruit and orange in there just a bit. A lot of wheat which I felt was a little deterring. It's okay to use some to haze up the beer and give a nice creamy mouthfeel to but this is a little overboard. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Medium carbonation. Overall a fantastic DIPA. Does it compare to Treehouse? I wouldn't know since I haven't had it. Does it compare to Trillium? Probably not. Trillium keeps things from being overly wheaty and has a much more intense hop character in their beers.
Don't be surprised if all of the newest Monkish releases start to trade high. These beers are tasting on treehouse level. 
Look- Looks like a glass of pineapple juice that survived the nuclear holocaust. 
Perfect
"Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts. "
Possible that the new fermentation profile kind of ruined this beer for me.
Appearance: the body is a cross between baby yellow and tan. Totally opaque with haze with a 1-finger white head with good retention.
Very solid smooth IPA. Contains Australian galaxy hops with peach Clementine fruit and pine. Didn’t think it was amazing compared to other offerings like DDH fort point but solid.
"Tastes and smells like biting into a citrus fruit on a freshly cut lawn beside a copse of pine trees. Great mouthfeel, very drinkable. Enough bitterness to balance out the juiciness nicely. A stalwart in Trillium’s awesome lineup."
"Deep cloudy orange with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of orange cream soda, lemon skin. Tastes of orange cream soda, grass, lemon skin. Heavy body with light carbonation."
"This should be top 10 ipa. Had in draft at the Greenway beer garden and in a 4 pack from the Congress st Brewery. Got a mixed case and no surprise , they are all incredible."
"Can from brewery, package date 4/17/18. Pours a golden, glowing hue; head dissipates quickly, some lacing left behind. Smells of grapefruit. "
Appearance - Pours murky cloudy deep orange color with nice fluffy white head. Lots of streaky lacing around the glass.
Excellent IPA! I usually grab this when available. Trillium is one of the best around.
Bottle from brewery. Amazing IPA... smooth as fresh draft. Galaxy hop lover wet dream.
Poured a light gold and hazy with a small thumb of head. Not great retention and lacing is not really there. 
Poured into a 13 oz Tired Hands Teku glass canned on 2/14/18. Pours a beautiful orange yellow with a massive 2 finger head that leaves plenty of thick lace behind.
Canned on 2/6/18 . 16 oz. Can. That was popped on 2/14/18
"Yellow orange and cloudy, but still somewhat see through, with lots of fine bubbled carbonation, and topped with 3 fingers of white, fluffy head. A nice lacing is left in the glass."
"Pours a hazy cloudy, completely opaque orange color. Thick velvety white head dissipates somewhat but a residual one finger head remains on the beer even as its consumed. "
one of--if not the best--showcasings of galaxy you can find.
One of the best beers I have ever had the luck to come across.
Aroma: Strong hop presence with nice citrus/spice/mellon notes.
Look- Hazy Orange. Has a thick luck to it. Very little translucency
"16oz can purchased at the Canton brewery stamped 11/02/17. Hazy orange look and citrus/grassy/piney nose. Complex flavors come and go and include citrus such as mango, orange and grapefruit along with a hint of peach sweetness. Slight grapefruit bitterness comes in on the finish. Another very enjoyable beer from Trillium."
Bought 4 pack from Canton. Was a bit disappointed. Am used to Treehouse and this was my first Trillium. Taste is more spring onion than juice bomb to me.
"From a tall boy from the fort point shop, into a willibecher, pours a chalky hazy and murky orange. Nose is excellent — a little sweet weed, some faint pine, and then a mix of tropical and citrus fruits. Taste is along the same lines, though less pine. Mouthful is lush and soft, super juicy. Among the best in style?"
"This is amazing stuff. I may move to New England just to get more treats from Trillium. Two pints in I was hallucinating and thinking I was drinking some sort of cloudy, pulpy, fruity hop shake."
"Went to the Canton brewery last night. First Trillium beer I ever had. The beer poured with a dark, hazy, orange appearance with no head but thick lacing. The aromas were grassy with a dense amount of hoppy citrus. The taste itself felt like a sweet, orange juice mixed with booze; amazing. This was a very drinkable beer with a good carbonation. Overall, this beer was outstanding across the board."
look is orange haze
"Thanks goes out to MastaaaGrillaaa for this brew, from NBS BIF#6"
Pours hazy orange-gold with a pinky finger of off-white head.
"L- beautiful creamy, hazy, opaque, juice. "
"Thanks to my East coast hookup for this beauty. 7.2% ABV, 1 Pint. Canned date is April 18, 2017."
can received in trade with tyler
"Pours a deep cloudy golden color with decent head and lacing. Notes of citrus, floral, pine, and honey. Taste is amazing, very smooth sweet notes of honey and floral, followed with some mild bitterness and hoppy undertones. Excellent beer, very smooth and easy to drink, outstanding IPA."
"Possibly the best appearance in an IPA ever. Well, maybe Tree House's Bright is a touch better to my eyes, but this head stands so tall beyond the lip of the glass, and the perfect glow and light transparency respectively mixing together like a gorgeous mimosa, it's a sight to behold. Hold it up to the light, hold it up to your eyes, hold it in your hand, all of it works in a wonderfully aesthetically pleasing sight. "
"16 oz canned on 8/23. Deep orange, nice head/retention and great lacing. Very strong citrus smell, oranges, mango, pineapple and a little floral. Smooth flavor, there is bitterness but it is met with grassy and citrusy notes. Strong mouthfeel, above average carbonation with a modest aftertaste. This is one of the best I have had from Trillium to date."
"Oh, yeah, worth the effort to get."
"Got a Trillium Brewery recently. A fine brew, but did not quite live up to the hype for me. A bit too undercarbonated, and way too much mango for my liking."
7/24/16 - one of the best DIPAs I've had
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy murky orange with thick rocky white head. Huge orange aroma with some lemon and tropical fruits. Taste is incredibly balanced with flavors of orange, tropical fruits, lemon. Incredible fruity IPA."
Cloudy straw appearance with a white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a prominent citrus with a touch of hops. Taste is also a very pleasant citrus with a slight hops
A - Yellow/Golden Opaque Hazy Appearance
Poured from can cloudy yellow. Amazing fruity fragrance. Immediate sweet and bitter flavor but there was no bad bite on palat afterwards. Near perfect IPA
super duper smooth drinking IPA that packs a punch.
Purchased from the Fort Point location. None of the cans in my four-pack had canned on dates on the bottom.
I stop bye every time I am in Boston. One of my favorites.
Poured into a Trillium tulip. 
Another winner from Trillium. My favorite of the Street series ( the DDH version is one of Trilly's best ) just so damn smooth and well balanced while also being super tasty and full of flavor. Drinks extremely easy. Well done
Look is a hazy dark grapefruit juice with nice white head. 
Poured from a can into a snifter.
16 oz can poured into spegaleu IPA glass canned on 5/19
"Poured from a 9 day-old can into a pint glass. Classic look - super hazy golden-yellow with a modest white head. Huge fruity aroma - pineapple, peach, tangerine, berries, and a touch of resin. The taste followed closely. Grapefruit, followed by a medley of fruit flavors with a slight dank undercurrent. A dry, biscuity malt presence. Soft on the palate and dry on the finish. Just awesome."
A fresh 16 oz. can poured into a tulip glass. 
Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can; nice minimalist artwork. Can date 4/18/17.
A: cloudy; medium gold in color; 1 finger off white head that receded to a wispy cap; very nice lacing;
Great looking apricot with a fairly low amount of carbonation. This smell is of tropical fruit but isn't overpowering. There are so many better reviews from people with a more advanced palette than mine but What i can contribute is the smell and taste profile came out better to me when this beer was cold and freshly poured.
16 oz can dated 4/18/17 (1 week old)
Canned 7 days ago. 
"Deep apricot hazy hue. Small amount of head that barely clings to the glass befor settling into a stark white ring. Overripe mango over a whisp of hop vapor. The tropical notes really overpower the nose and its wonderful that they do. The flavor follow the nose with precision, but the hops become more assertive kicking of the back of the throat late. Creamy and gently carbonated, yet somehow crisp and dry. Simply an amazing world class flagship deserving of its continued praise. Congress Street will stand the test of time."
"Big citrus smell, really wonderfully fragrant... big fluffy head, round and creamy mouthfeel... lots of orange peel, ripe stone fruit... hoppy but not bitter... I'm not usually an IPA guy, but boy am I enjoying this."
Poured a cloudy yellow body with soapy head that slowly died and left lace patches. The soapy suds leave an acidic orange juice like aroma with some sweet fruit smells hanging around. Thin bodied and smooth but oh so flavorful and great with an acidic sharpness that is balanced with a mild tangerine sweetness and there are touched of earth/dirt and pine/resin to add a little crispness to finish.
10oz tulip on tap at TRB.
A pint can dated 02/01/17 received in a surprise box from the very generous BA jhavs. poured in a 13oz. tulip for the review. 
"cloudy, murky fruitful, dank, aromatic, citrusy, refreshing, only low point low on carbonation - but oh boy should we move to Boston??"
Canned 19 Jan 2017. Apricot and acidic orange juice aroma. Some very subtle bubblegum also. Little carbonation. Palate has nice stone fruit sweetness up front and a dry crisp bitterness a the end.
Can. Fruity.
"Hazy, orange brew with a white head that leaves a few gobs of lacing on the glass. The orange stands out the most but there is a healthy dose of grapefruit pith and pine. This goes for both the scent and taste. The beer is like a glass of o.j. with grapefruit pith. There is a really nice bitter finish. Very good, hazy IPA."
On tap at the Canton brewery. Bitter but smooth. Had again later at greenway beer garden.
Can from the brewery in Boston
"A bit creamier than I excepted, with a fruit nose, delightful bitterness and a long finish"
"02/01/17 canning, featuring Galaxy and Columbus hops, 7.2% abv..."
Finally I get to Trillium! Worth the wait! Everything you need to have in this style of beer. Great hazy look to this beer light gold color cannot see through. Smell is citrus with a pine hint. Taste is awesome wish I lived closers! Feel is just right. I should just conclude that if you like craft beer this is what you want!
"This checks all the boxes you want in an ipa. Has that nice NE cloudy appearance. Smells a little more subtle than expected but all the notes are there. Pineapple, mango, pine, a little earthiness. Taste explodes with pineapple, peach, pine, and some wheat cracker malt. Feels smooth and creamy. Great ipa that's surprisingly balanced for a tropical hop bomb."
This is a wonderful beer for sure. A great expression of Galaxy without being over the top. Tropical fruits and citrus with that earthy weedy taste in the finish. Appropriately bitter and delicious. yb
"Canned 09-08-16. Drank 09-15-16. Fruity, juicy & delicious!"
"First had 8/14/16 at home from Erik L. Super citrusy, with a nice hop punch. Also balanced with some bisuityness. This is, to me, exactly how an IPA should be."
22oz bottle poured into a tulip
Slightly bitter.
"This one is a tropical bomb. I get a ton of mango, and orange juice flavor out of this one with the mango being the star. Everything about this beer screams New England style IPA juice bomb. Love this beer, the only problem is that I live no where near the source."
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, orange coloring, with a low profile, filmy, clingy, foamy, white head. Aromas of orange, melon, pineapple, and mango...nice and juicy. Flavors are citrus and tropical fruit forward, juicy and slightly acidic, with a heavy dose of orange, mango, melon, grapefruit, and pineapple. Subtle grassy bitterness in the backbone to balance perfectly. Smooth, mid-bodied feel, with an acidic edge towards the end. Completely fruit juice aftertaste, sweet and juicy, with a solid linger past the crisp, clean finish. Great beer."
"Congress Street is the IPA that made me fall in love with them. Such a beautiful smooth hop taste. Great citrus taste, very juicy and very smooth. Amazing mouthfeel."
"Absolutely terrific beer. To have an IPA take me back with such a well balanced citrus / pine bittersweet punch in such a sophisticated frenzy at this point (after having well over 500+ IPAs) was breathtaking. Consistent throughout the beer, smooth and well crafted body, terrific finish that leaves behind a crisp memory of the citrus and sweetness."
Trillium Congress Street
"Super hazy golden peach color with a thick white head and great lacing. Citrus and hops flood the nose. Notes of citrus peels, grapefruit, stone fruits and honey dipped tangerine slices. Medium body, chewy heft, snap of carbonation fills the mouth, finishes dry. What an amazing IPA!"
Look - beautiful pale orange color
A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy apricot-yellow with no head. 
"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with minimal head. Taste is grapefruit, unripened mango, grass, and light cracker. Medium bodied, sweet start with distinct bitter finish. Tasty, juicy, solid showcase for Galaxy hops. Very very good when judged against most IPAs, but maybe in the middle for what Trillium does. Well worth seeking out."
"Got lucky yesterday at Treehouse and was able to trade a Green for a Congress Street in the parking lot. Put it in the refrigerator over night, drinking it now and it was easily worth the trade! Great beer all around!"
"16 oz can, bottom of which tells me this has been in the can for just over a month"
"Just a short note on one of the most marvelous beers, it must have something to do with the white wheat that makes this very special. My good friend tolerates my IPA madness, but he screamed this is the first IPA he has ever liked a LOT. Could not give him enough of it, and I have to say the fragrance and overall balance of this beer between the malts and hoppy flower/fruit aromas makes it one of my very hard to get favorites!"
A: Fresh-sliced pineapple. Red grapefruit. Mango. Pine. Dank grass. Subtle peach.
"Got in a BIF from oline73. 16 ounce can into signature tulip glass, canned on 9/21/2016. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an insane IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modest bitterness. A highly amazing offering."
Pours out like orange juice. Murky/hazy bright orange.
"Can dated 08/11/16. ""Very beer. Much wow!"""
"I was a little disappointed in this IPA since it was one of there top rated beers on BA, as well as UnTappd. It poured a foggy translucent pale golden color with a white meringue head that laced ever so beautifully. it had immediate notes of citrus and pine in the taste and nose. overall it was a light bodied beer with surprisingly low bitterness."
"Pour is a hazy, murky medium orange hue, almost looks like straight OJ. Frothy white head that settles to a ring quickly. Aroma is a big burst of tropical fruit. Getting plenty mangos upfront, backdoor with burst of bananas, pineapple, papaya, and cantaloupe. Subtle sweet malt, and earthy hops come out as it warms. Following the nose well, the taste has the same tropical fruit. Hints of citrus zest, some sweet malt. Mouthfeel isn't overly thick or palate coating, but a little resinous with the hops. Overall a very well balanced, nothing is too overpowering, and very refreshing."
Can dated 9/8/2016 poured into tulip on 9/29/2016
"Consumed a fresh can in early August. Light orange haze, similar to other Trillium brews. Lemon/lime citrus on nose and taste, also getting pine and some grassiness. Very good."
Fresh can from Trillium. Kept cold since moment of purchase.
The beer is a light yellow with intense haze. Good thick white head but poor retention and little lacing.
16oz. can into a Surly teku. Canned 9/8/16. 
This is a complete fruit bomb. Light pine leads to sweet orange and pineapple on the nose and it tastes just like it smells. Smooth finish with very little bite. This is an amazing beer.
L: Translucent orange juice. nice white head.
Pours out of the can beautifully with a hazy orange pineapple juice appearance. 
Golden hazy yellow color in the glass with a slight tilt towards the red spectrum. Definitely lots of fruit in the nose; Mellon grapefruit and pineapple. Taste is rather dry with a slight bready quality that finishes a bit too bitter for my taste. Feel is nice with a medium high carbonation. Overall a really good beer that is just a tad too bitter for my taste.
"A- The tall can drops into my tulip with a very chalky, cloudy golden yellow body and a gargantuan fluffy white head. The cap ascends quickly to a few fingers high dying slowly to thick pillows and a ring around the sides."
A pounder can poured into a tulip appears a chalky golden color with a white cap that holds well fading leaving webby lace.
"beautiful creamy white head. lots of luscious tropical fruit flavors and aromas. these guys just don't put out a bad brew, do they? easy to drink. almost light on the palate...."
"Bottled on 08/11/2016, consumed on 08/26/2016. Super fresh!"
"It looks beautiful like pretty much any Trillium beer. The nose is tropical with a bit of sweetness. The taste is a big juicy explosion of pineapple and melon with just enough bitterness and malt presence to give it that perfect balance. Overall, a truly excellent IPA."
"Had it in a can dated 8/4/16 explosive aroma of orange,citrus, slightly dank. Looks like juice in a glass, mouthwatering, I can smell it across the room"
"Pours an extremely hazy golden orange with over two fingers of foamy white head. The nose is an amazing combination of citrus, tropical fruit, and pine. The flavor starts off like the nose would suggest, tons of orange, pineapple, peach, and melon, with some pine but balanced very well by a malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium, maybe a little thick feeling because of the medium to low carbonation. This beer has lived up to the hype for me! The smell has so much going on just as the taste does. All the flavors meld well together but each standout!"
"Bracingly bright and gripping with bitterness, Congress Street avoids many pitfalls that even great IPA fall into, which is great succulence in aroma and flavor but lacking the bitter balance that the style deserves."
"Pours hazy, golden. Aroma is full of fresh tropical fruit. Taste is great, juicy melon and orange, nice hoppiness, smooth finish. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."
A - Pours a hazy orange with a nice thick head.
"Finally tracked down this ""classic."" Was expecting it to be a bit mundane compared to the other Trillium craziness I've had before it, but it was very much able to keep up with the big boys."
Bottle poured into Aslin Teku glass.
"16oz can, dated 06.29.2016, first can run, poured into a Trillium snifter."
"Hazy OJ looking pour. Big citrus smell, bubble gum(?), nectarines, tangerines. Whoah! Taste follows with citrusy sweetness that's cut into on the back with some bitter. Feel Is light medium with nice carbonation. Another great ipa from Trillium!"
"hazed golden orange, tight white head and excellent lacing. "
"Smell is orange, mango, canned peaches, papaya, hints of pineapple, and citrus rind. Taste is fresh-squeezed orange juice, tropical fruit medley, pineapple, and just mild bitterness. So smooth and easy to drink - all juiciness and no alcohol."
Had from a can and was like wow! But I'm not a hipster! Lol. Was very enjoyable and pleasant! Cheers. #notmakingfunofhipsters
"Pure hop juice, if you like hop aroma and abundant hop flavor than this is your beer. Get some."
An absolute treat from nose to finish. Very well balanced.
"From the 750 ml. bottle. Sampled on July 2, 2016."
Exactly what a New England style IPA should be. Cloudy in the glass with the fruity Galaxy aromas erupting from the glass. Mouth feel was a little on the thick side with tropical fruit flavors and just a hint of bitterness
Bottle date: 6-16-16
Appearance- Light Orange/Pale Gold light haze
Canned 6/29.
"A very well made beer! It is a very balanced beer with just the right amount of fruits, it is a wonderful beer for a hot summer day. I highly recommend it!"
Poured from a 750ml bottle into an imperial pint glass.
"Opaque yellow-tan with a large foamy, porcelain head and clingy lace."
"This beer poured a pale hazy yellow color with a thick creamy head and some nice lacing. The smell was fantastic. Tropical citrus with plenty of orange, some pineapple and grapefruit. Unfortunately the flavor didn't live up to the smell. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this beer. The flavor though was mostly grapefruit and I just wish it had a bit more of the pineapple and orange. Overall this was a great beer. I will definitely get this one again."
"Wow for a single IPA this packs in so much flavor! The feel is near perfect, and the taste is not far behind with a wonderful trifecta of pine, tropical fruit, and hops. Smell is more hop and delicate fruit forward, but also very, very pleasant."
"Looks beautiful in the glass. People with more discerning noses picked out a bouquet of flavors. Grapefruit is what stuck out the most to me. The taste seems a little one-dimensional, but not in a bad way at all. Perfectly balanced. I could drink this all night without getting tired of it. No flaws, and no suggestions for improvement, so I'm going with a perfect score for this one."
"A: Cloudy golden straw/peach color, 2 finger creamy white head, good retention, little to no lacing"
"Serving: On tap, 12oz pour, at Pastoral "
"A - hazy as orange juice, lots of floaties, hazier as you finish the bottle, nice orange amber color, big fluffy white head that sticks forever and leaves nice lacing"
"L: cloudy light gold, looks like grapefruit juice, thick head"
Real good IPA!
Congress St picked up a growler yesterday 5/7/16
"Is it just me or are some beers from certain New England Breweries way overrated? This beer is good but nothing to get exited about. The smell is citrus which is good, but not enough of it. Maybe the dry hopped version is even better. The taste is bitter with a little citrus but mostly a combination of two hops that have a murky taste that doesn't showcase any specific flavors. Yet, it tastes pretty good. It goes down pretty well but a little acidic towards the end. Overall a good beer but not a beer that I would chase after."
Consumed 5/6/16
Bottled 4/7/2016. 
"Beautiful hazy orange body with a thick creamy head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The smell is very bright and very tropical and sweet (think pineapple). Taste follows the smell, with the addition of caramel sweetness, that's borderline cloying. The feel is spectacular aside from the sweetness. Overall this is a world-class IPA, no doubt, however I wish it were a tad less sweet."
"Looks like strained pineapple juice with about a finger of white head. Pick up citrus, pine, grapefruit, and lemon zest in the nose. Refreshing taste.....lemon, citrus, and low bitterness. Feel is silky with medium low carbonation. Excellent ipa.....drinkability is off the charts."
Bottle Date: 3/8/16
Hazy golden yellow. White head.
"I had some discouraging preconceptions from some other friends of mine that have said not as good as Hill Farmstead, Lawson's, or Tree House. Nonetheless, I truly beg to differ. I think that Trillium really holds its own against all of them [Tree House is still the best though]. Congress is a deep, hazy orange with two finger soapy head. It smells of citrus especially grapefruit. The taste is also heavily grapefruit but not overly bitter by the balanced chewy softness of the mouthfeel and possibly the fact that some of the hop profiles faded after opening 2 months after bottling. All things considered, Trillium's Congress Street is something that should NOT be overlooked."
"Picked up today in Canton, poured into tulip glass"
"I kid you not this beer deserves all 5s. It is the best IPA, and best beer I have ever had. It comes in with such a tropical taste, but smacks you with hops. The mouthfeel is amazing, and the grapefruit after taste is unreal. I actually got this from the liquor store I work at on a bit of a whim, and wow I am so glad I took this over the Jacks Abby Excess I was planning on buying. If you ever see this at a store, buy it."
"Trillium's flagship brew (or is it Fort Point?) is tremendous. Really strong orange rind, grapefruit..more bitterness than other Trillium beers I've had. "
"A: Looks like orange juice. Very hazy, with that lighter orange color one is used to seeing at breakfast. 4/5."
"in a lot of ways, i like this better than the double dry hopped edition thats getting so much hype. something a little more simple about this one, and i think it features a bit more bitterness, more true to ipa than some of these other east coast juice bombs. still, its a dull orange thick cloudy yeasty looking ipa, definitely east coast. pretty head on it, lacy, tall, and defiant. it smells awesome, juicy and southern hemisphere hops happening in this one, creamy and oily at the same time, leafy and green, incredibly fresh. tough to place the varietals, lemon notes and mango notes, hints of pine cleaner and tangy zest, lots happening. the flavor is a lot like the nose, but its divided into two parts. the first part is hop flavor, which includes citrus fruits and peach in its fruitiness, as well as a chlorophyll green new vegetal thing, lots of hops for sure. the second part is the bitterness, which i missed in the double dry hop edition, and really appreciate a lot here. its woody bitter like centennial hops, but too fruity for that, which carries over through the finish. lots of body for what it is, soapy sudsy feel, good carbonation, and i appreciate what the residual yeast contributes in flavor and in feel. overall an elite level ipa, one of the best i have had from these guys, and on par with most anything else coming out of the east and getting tons of hype. juicy and distinct, worthy of its high regard, insanely easy down. a weirdly awesome combination with a homemade meatball sandwich from belfiores, now thats lunch!"
A - Typical opaque & cloudy orange-juice-like appearance with a thin layer of eggshell coloured head. 
"Wow. I mean wow. This juice bomb IPA is right up there with the best out there. Get it, drink it. Smile."
What I hate about this beer is that it makes other beers taste bad. Best single IPA I've had aside from Focal Banger. Tastes great. Juicy and fresh with a deliciously light malt backbone. Get your hands on a fresh bottle. It's great.
"Growler poured fresh from the brewery (this evening) into a Proclamation Ale tulip. Gonna keep this short and sweet. I've had hundreds of fine ales (and that was just last week!) but Congress Street is one of the finest I've tasted. Matter of fact, Trillium makes many of the finest ales I've ever tasted. I'm blessed to live a short drive away from the Canton brewery."
"pours a beautiful murky orange with almost peach hue to it. beautiful lacing, uneven foamy head. smell is oranges, mangos, light citrus, some pine, orange creamsicle, and a little grassy. absolutely no malt on the nose. taste is the same as smell but very heavy on the orange and orange creamsicle tastes. very little malt on the back end. mouth feel is that perfect NE IPA juicy fuzz. beautiful beer from Trill, can wait to crack it's older brother in the fridge."
Super citrusy. Super hoppy.
"Trillium just does not make bad beers. This one is no different. Lots of hazy, fruity I, sticky goodness with tons of delicious hop character on the nose. Perfect carb with a nice juicy pour."
"Poured into a willy glass. Pours a very hazy, dirty yellow-orange, with a fluffy, off-white head that coats the glass. Smell is very tropical, with pineapple being prominent. Taste is delicious - tropical, sweet, low bitterness, some grass, but mostly pineapple/mango/orange. Mouth is just right - medium body, creamy, silky, average carbonation, on the sweet side. Overall, another great one from Trillium."
750ml bottle dated 02/10/16
"L: Bright yellow, with golden highlights. Off white, frothy head that is thick and silky. Body is hazy. Some lace left behind throughout the drink."
Poured from the bottle into stemmed tulip.
750 poured into tulip glass. 2/10/16
"Hit by the solid aroma upon opening, happy. This is the juiciest IPA I have ever seen, bottles 2/10. At first I was slightly disappointed, seemed a little one dimensional and thin. Let it warm up just slightly and boom! Everything changed, the hop profile really came through, that galaxy is amazing. Love the texture and depth of flavor, the yeast here is bar none ridiculous."
"Absolutely intense haziness and juicy smell. A complete surprise for me, and very delicious. For me, it's easy up in the Julius and King Sue category for juicy hoppy citrusy beers."
"Hazy, opaque golden color with frothy head. Smells of pineapple, pine, passion fruit, and citrus. Taste follows the nose with a light earthy bitterness on the finish. Grapefruit comes through as well as passion fruit, maybe some melon and papaya. There's a lot of flavors going on here. The mouth feel is full and creamy. This is a perfect example of the tropical, hazy, east coast IPAs."
Tropical fruity deliciousness. 99.9% balanced. Not the best of the best but a very damn good beer. Is it worth the price point? Probably not but if you are in the area you have to try this at Trillium just for the experience.
"L - hazy peach color, small white head, some lacing"
L -- A ridiculously hazy peach color. Frothy white head that sticks around for a bit and falls to a ring. The lacing sticks around for ages and falls down all sides. 
22oz bottle dates 2/10/16.
"super freshie from my man mark who snagged me a bottle at the brewery. bottled 2/10/16, so 5 days old, enjoyed from a trillium Willie becher. gorgeous looks...sticky goop lace all over the glass. nose is out of this world dripping with sticky fresh hops. taste follows suit...a bit on the bitter side for trillium, but juicy and super enjoyable."
"The beer pours a hazy almost fruit juice like color and consistency with a 1/4"" head of white foam."
A: Hazy mix of pineapple and orange juice. Leaves a dense two finger off white head.
"Growler from the Fort Point location, think it was $16? Appearance was more than hazy, it was murky, swampy, and orange, guess this is what NE IPA's are supposed to look like? Aroma is citrus, hops, citrus, and citrus. Flavor is pineapple, orange juice, grapefruit and surprisingly not really bitter. This was fantastic and now I get why NE IPA's are the thing now. If I lived near Boston I would drink this every chance I got."
"Poured into a snifter from a growler, filled today around noon and consumed today around 6pm :)"
"750 ml bottle. Hazy orange with thick white head, fades slowly to a glob, lots of lace. Nice fruity aroma. Taste starts with some juicy goodness but is immediately taken over by dank piney hops, weedy. Hops turn earthy at the end. Full soft mouthfeel. Excellent bold dank IPA."
"Hazy yellowish body with a thick, foamy head. Aromas of melon, cracker, biscuit. Juicy melon character throughout. Medium bodied, juicy, moderate bitterness in the finish. Nice."
L: Hazy golden hues with an inch and a half head - gorgeous lacing throughout
Been lucky enough to try a few beers from Trillium over the past few weeks. This one is the best I've had. 
Not trilliums best but an amazing beer none the less. Has a really nice dry finish but is less juicy than trilliums other options. A very solid offering from this amazing brewery.
"Aroma - As I was setting up to take a pic of my pour the hops were bursting out of the glass at me. A lovely bouquet of guava, orange, passionfruit, and melon."
"Poured 25 oz bottle into a Stella glass. Pours a cloudy golden color with a nice thick white head. Laces the glass nicely all the way down. Aroma is incredible to the point I keep smelling the empty bottle it's that good. All you smell is delicious hops, dank, flower, citrus hints attack the nostrils with veracity. Taste was very good but a little disappointed cause the smell was so good. Immediately get the hop forward taste I love with citrus Grapfruit, mango and the a good bitter resin grass finish. Mouthfeel was refreshing but a little light. Overall it's a great IPA, worthy of its #12 ranking!"
"Thank you, Patrick. Bottled 05 Nov, consumed 24 Nov. "
"Wow, this is why I love drinking IPA's. This beer achieves a perfect balance of complexity verses cleanliness and flavor without bitterness. Congress Street has a great citrus floral flavor with a clean smooth finish. This ranks as one of my favorites along with Lawson's sip o sunshine and Nightshift Santilli."
"What a great beer. The look is spot on. The smell is good. Doesn't blow your mind, but good. Feels good in the mouth. Almost tingly. Smooth finish with just a hint of bitterness on the finish. Really enjoyed this one."
"A. Light murky straw color, cloudy, opaque, frothy fine-bubble head with an egg shell color. Strong effervescence and laces."
"Fresh bottle received in trade, poured into snifter tasting glass."
I had the Congress St. IPA. Excellent! Great hop nose popping out of the glass.
"Drank within 2.5 weeks of bottling. Man this looks like a glass of OJ. Aroma of tropical fruit and pine. Murky gold pour with a plump head that lingers. Taste of melon, mango, pineapple, apricot and orange. Huge hop kick as expected; but there's also a nuanced cascade of citrus flavors with a very light malt backbone that doesn't detract from the fruit. Soft mouthfeel but the acidity is there on account of all the citrus. Light bitterness closes the proceedings."
"Great tropical fruit smell when the cap is first opened, tastes same balanced with a light dankness, amber/yellow, pours 1 in of-white fluffy foam that lingers at 1/2 inch. Recommended."
"Awesome beer from Trillium. After imbibing an UPPERCASE, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Extremely aromatic and filled with flavor. Wish I got more."
Wow! Where do I start. Pours a orangy honey color. Has a fantastic aroma of dank resiny hops with orange peel notes. The flavor is fantstic. Juicy hops with a dank resiny flavor with a nice citrus aftertaste. Nice finish to the beer and overall this is fantastic
"Bottle, pours a very cloudy dark orange golden color with a huge white foamy head. There is quite a bit of a frothy lacing. The odor to me is powerful, citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, grassy, peach, apricot, floral, slightly spicy, dried fruits, dank, and slightly malty. The taste for me is honey, floral, tropical fruits, apricot, grapefruit, lemon, orange, slight spice, slightly bread like, herbal, resin, some dry bitterness throughout."
"750ml bottle poured into a Gandhi Bot snifter. Chilled at under 50F. Appeared hazy dark yellow with two finger white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is strong with floral, citrus and pine notes. It is a well-balanced, intensely hop-forward brew from Trillium. The flavor matches the aroma verbatim on the palate. A very solid, flavorful IPA with decent amount of hops for those hopheads out there. The bitter floral finish makes me wanting more... I polished the 750mL by myself haha (don't judge, I was thirsty). Overall an excellent IPA coming out of Boston and would love to try their Double Dry Hopped version of this as well. Cheers!"
L - hazy medium orange. Beautiful and piercing. Very consistent color through and through. Just a pleasant beer to look at. 
22oz bottle into a pint glass
"Please, sir, may I have another? comes to mind. Poured from the bottle into a Teku glass. Vibrant tangerine body swept golden and yellow with a finger of pillowy, white head. Grapefruit and peach and pineapple all around: luscious fruity notes. A mouthfeel like feathers being dragged across your tongue. Refreshing, crisp, sensual, delicious."
What's to be said? 
"L: Hazy. Orange at the center, fading to yellow at the edges. Big head and nice lacing"
32oz. growler (filled today) poured into a tulip
22 oz bomber poured into Teku glass.
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip
There is absolutely NOTHING bad I can say about this beer. Other than I wish it was brewed in my backyard of course
"Murky straw color under a frothy white head that sticks to the glass. Fruity aromas like mango, orange, and papaya meet more of a green hoppy spice. Tastes of unripe fruit, creamy tangerines, and light scalliony dankness. Pretty light and soft in the mouth. Nice, if nothing special. I’d love to try the Double Dry Hopped variety."
Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Trillium Tulip. Purchased at the brewery on bottle day. 
"Popping open a 750mL bottle from 7/30 acquired in a trade thanks to Michael. Rarely, and I mean this honestly, do I give out 5's. This beer, however, is just so beautiful that it is the first IPA I've ever had to receive 5 in the looks department. Super dense cloudiness, gold with hint of orange, and a fluffy white head. "
"Poured in a tulip glass. Color was straw colored and it was clearer than I expected. I was a little disappointed by this. Great aroma, but the taste was not as good as I hoped. Harsh bitter finish"
"Bright, tropical, piney, bitter yet sweet. Awesome beer"
"A: Hazy orange tinged light amber. Thick white head, nice lacing and some retention. "
"Another great IPA from Trillium. Personally I prefer a couple of the others I've had, Melcher, Pier, etc., but I wouldn't throw any of them out of bed."
Looks nice.
Another winner from Trillium. Great nose and i just love the unfiltered look it has. Something that you could drink multiple of and never get tired of it. Wish i lived right around the corner !!
"The beer is a pale tan yellow color. The head is white and voluminous. Lots of lacing and whatnot. The aroma is full of fruity hop flavor. Big pineapple and tangerine. Lime, orange peel, mango. Light yeasty note. Maybe a little fresh pale malt character but it’s way in the background. Taste is hoppy with essentially no initial bitterness. The finish is yeasty and dry with lingering moderate bitterness. Very flavorful. Fresh and bright hoppiness. Easy to drink. Soft, full mouthfeel. Another tasty, tasty hoppy beer from Trillium."
Pours hazy Orangish yellow. Looks like pear juice. 
"Hazy, hazy, hazy. Looks like a creamsicle. Tried this for the first time yesterday. Nose is heavy mangoes and peaches and oranges. Taste is heavier on the peach and citrus - and is outstanding. Been waiting to try this for a while. Well worth the wait."
"Looks, smells and tastes like grapefruit juice. It's a citrus bomb of deliciousness. So damn good."
after trying the pale it was a special treat to taste this from the growler -thank you Tim!
Great beer. Solid balance of malt and dry hop. Similar in taste to four point but more hoppy as it should be. Great warm weather beer that has a balanced taste
"Beautiful hazy, apricot pulp yellow color, with a decent head. "
Poured from a 750ml bottle dated 62215.
"Amazing. Super hazy pour. Citrus from tops to tails. Bomb. I had the double dry hop version weeks ago, this is sweeter and more drinkable."
Best DIPA I have had to date. Trumps Dinner and Heady in the delicousness department.
"Raising the score, after not having this for a few months, then having it again, other ipas pale in comparison (sick joke). but seriously, if you like unfiltered north east ipas, this is where to start"
"Poured from a bottle less than a week old. Color is a hazy yellow and looks like fresh squeezed juice. Aroma is sweet citrus . Taste is fresh and crisp with notes of grapefruit, peach, and apple. There is also some pine. The finish is a mild and enjoyable bitterness. Leaves the mouth coated with a slightly dry. Very delicious and drinkable IPA."
"Bottled on May 26, 2015; 6 days before drinking."
I shared this bottle with friends and they had tried it in the past and insisted this is a different/off batch. This is my first time having it (drank the DDH version a few weeks ago) and there was just something weird about it.
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow orange color that looks like tropicana with a fluffy bright white head that eventually fades to a ring around the edge of the glass and a microfilm layer. Smell is amazing. Dank pine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange peel all burst out of the glass. Taste is the same with a nice nectarine juiciness as well. Feel is light and very soft and juicy with just the right amount of bitterness. Overall just fantastic. This is my favorite beer by Trillium and absolutely world class."
"Top 3 IPA...citrus/hop bomb. Very cloudy/bright yellow in color. Has a creamy mouthfeel, notes of pine, mango and grapefruit. Perfectly balanced beer. Having the convenience to drink it fresh and often is why I often dream about Trillium."
"Yet another hazy, orange juice appearance with a creamy white head. I enjoy the hazy beers but Trillium sure doesn't offer much in the way of variety in how their beers look, that's for sure. But you know what? I love it. "
"750ml bottle served in a tulip at 47 degrees. Bottled 050515. Pours a dull orange-gold with a murky clarity and a rocky, two inch, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a thick dollop of foam with delicate swaths of lacing revealed as the beer recedes. Nose expresses sugary citrus nose, a grassy quality and a kiss of spice. Taste comes off a bit dull - earthy hops upfront followed by a light citrus character and a mild medicinal quality that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a consistent, even carbonation and a mild acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a decent IPA but not my favorite Trillium offering. It all comes off a bit dull."
Nice haze to it with citrus and hops on the nose. Taste follows the nose with a bit of earthiness and pine to it as well. Great beer overall.
"Pours hazy orange with a one finger head. Very aromatic - tropical citrus, floral, pepper. Taste is chock full of citrus and tropical fruits, bitter and hoppy on the back end. An IPA drinkers IPA. Congress St looks, smells, and feels beautiful. Taste is hop forward, juicy, bitter and delicious."
It's between Congress St. and Julius for me...
"A: Hazy, light pineapple yellow in color with a thin, white head."
Not my favorite Trillium with so much resin overtone but it's still better than 99% of the beers out there.
A 3/30/15 dated bottle poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.
Great tropical fruit smell and taste. Lots of Grapefruit. Another great ipa from Trillium.
Great nose and flavor. Nice hops.
Trillium is steady on the rise. Haven't had a bad beer from them yet!
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
I'm sick of my recent IPA binge and this still tastes amazing!!
Poured from 750 bottle dated 3/17/2015 into snifter. 
"great citrus flavor, smoother than Cigar City IPA"
Aroma - BIG aroma of orange citrus and some resiny and oniony hop flavors as well. Very inviting.
Super solid IPA. Drank from a frosty... the smell didn't blow me away... but the start and finish of this IPA was fantastic all the way through. Was kind of sad when the bomber was gone. Still waiting to get my hands on some TreeHouse... but best AIPA coming out of MA to-date. If this stuff came in pint cans... oh ya...!
Holy f**kness! Incredible! Enough said.
Great beer. Complex and smooth.
"I don't give out many 5's, this is one."

"Smooth criminal, this one. Aroma on point, flavor smooth and creamy, mouthfeel soft and non-astringent. Damn this was good!"
"Fresh bottle from trade. BIG thanks! Pours murky yellow golden with a one finger fluffyish white head. Looks a little flat on the pour. Aroma of pineapple juice, oranges, lots of tropical citrus here. Flavor is very sweet pineapple juice and orange zest, lightly bitter, twinge of lemongrass. Mouthfeel is fuller and smooth, but this is way on the flat side with nearly no carbonation. Everything is there flavor wise, but this really seems like it might be a bad batch or bottling given the low carbonation, and that really takes away from what seems to otherwise be a delicious treat. Hope to try it again and up the score, though it's good as is."
A: Cloudy yellow pours with a billowing head that contains small bubbles
"IMHO this is an exceptional IPA. Great flavors, great look, great taste, great smell."
"Poured from a bottle dated 1/31 into a tulip.....slightly older than I wanted to drink this one, but not too far out. I've had this beer the day of release before, and the overall experience wasn't all that different"
"Another great IPA from Trillium. An unfiltered cloudy straw pour from a fresh growler with a bubbly thin head. A big piney hop nose. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine, with a touch of tropical fruit....really good stuff. A bit of the ganja as well.... Ya mon! Nice bitterness throughout, with plenty on the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp yet creamy; a pleasure to drink. Like all of the street series IPAs from them, this is another well crafted beer by Trillium. A bit pricey at $23 for a growler, but worth the splurge. One I will remember as my Pats were winning #4 while I was having it."
"Its been a while since I have had the regular version of this beer. Big citrus nose on this. Lots of orange smell and flavor in the taste. A smooth and slightly acidic mouthfeel on this, ends with a slight bitter fruit ending."
this was one fantastic beer.. less than a month old... a must try..
"2nd time having this beer. Sticker date of 1/9, drank on 1/12. Opened it for about 45 min before pouring."
"Appeared to be really hazy while in the bottle, and is completely opaque in my glass. Nice orange color with a solid white head. "
"Hazy orange in the glass, a bit like movie popcorn butter. The nose is mostly pine and tangerine with a touch of straw. The taste is as phenomenal as it is complex: minerals, dried herbs, weed, and tangerine round out with an assertive hop bite that perfectly dries the palate for the next sip. Julius was my previous benchmark for an IPA, but this is in the same league. Seek it out."
"Bottle got in a recent IP trade, thanks Isaac."
"This beer is awesome, well worth visiting the brewery to get it. Unfiltered hoppy goodness, very well balanced with a super piney nose and flavor with a decent lighter body and bitter lasting finish. Great stuff."
Bottled 01/02/14 (yesterday). Tulip glass.
"First time having this, fresh from the brewery too, delicious but dissapointed big time, good IPA but id just say good"
Definitely in my top ten of IPA's.
Bottled on 12/23/14 and consumed on 12/29/14. So this might be the freshest IPA I've ever had.
"Has a lot of similarities to Fort Point, but appears to feature something along the lines of Galaxy hops -- which gives this a brighter and more aggressive citrus bitterness. Notes of pear, sweet meyer lemon, blood orange, grapefruit rind, and maybe a touch of pineapple. Lightly sweet but highly citric fruit flavours with a pillowy smooth body and a dry, tongue-scraping bitterness on the finish."
"The beer is excellent, but the flavors are subtle."
"Big bright tropical citrus hop nose that veers a bit toward the astringent citrus juice realm on the palate but manages to keep it just enough in check. Good...but Fort Point feels more complete, less like a slightly watery glass of (tasty) hoppy citrus juice."
One of the best ipas out there. Well balanced. Easy drinking no bitterness love it
This beer is one of the best that I've ever tasted. Just my style of IPA.
"Beautiful hazy golden-yellow brew, topped with a sizable snow white, fluffy head. Great retention and very nice lacing."
"Really liked this cold out of the fridge (4.5), but as it warms I enjoy it less. There seems to be something in the Trillium house character that I don't particularly care for, although I have a hard time putting my finger on it."
Poured from the 750 ml bottle into a Central Waters snifter.
Date: 11/16/14
"Hazy and thick this beer pours with a beautiful white head that lingers for what seems like an impossible amount of time. The tropical hops practically punch you in the face when you put your nose to it. A sip brings waves of mango, pineapple and peach comforted by an amazingly soft mouthfeel. An incredible IPA."
"Great IPA here, poured out as a hazy golden color with a white head on top. Great retention and lacing. The smell of the beer has a great hoppy aroma, loads of citrus and dank hops. The taste is also very good too, great heavy Hop flavors and subtle sweetness. Overall I love this beer, it's a great offering from Trillium once again."
Outstanding. Extremely drinkable with the perfect blend of citrus and hops.
"Cloudy, which surprised me. As the other reviews mirror this, it is normal I see. Tropical citrus aroma anand taste. Smooth with a bitter and sweet finish. Overall, it is great and reminds me of a sweeter Two Hearted."
"A - Golden yellow, cloudy, completely opaque in appearance. Much lighter color than most IPAs but the opaque OJ like appearance along with the fluffy, frothy inch plus head that laces perfectly hints at the explosive flavors to follow"
"Awesome IPA....fresh, crushable, light malts, pineapple, and bright citrus...thanks Kyle! One of the better IPA's I've had in quite a while."
Appearance: Pours a very cloudy honey color with a massive head; great stickage with lacing clumping on the side of the glass
"Boston,"
"I always pick some of this up when it is available. This is just a solid, awesome IPA. Just the right amount of bitterness but amazingly drinkable."
Less aroma and hop flavor than the pale but much more bitter. I find the pale to be tastier but this grows on you too!
"A-Very cloudy orange, well carbonated and a two finger head that leaves nice lacing."
I've had many different type of beers and this beer is a great IPA.. Trillium has been on point with a lot of beers and they hit it with this one.. This beer is hoppy with an unbelievable citrus taste.. If I had to compare this beer to any beer it would be Abner by Hill Farmstead.. Cheers!!!
"Thank you SuperHop18 for this amazing extra! Pours a hazy, gold color with a thick 2 finger head with great retention. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose with hints of pine resin. Fruity on the tongue with great bitterness and just enough malt to balance it out nicely. Medium bodied with good carbonation. "
Poured an darker orange color with a 3F head in a Speigelgau glass. Some lacing.
A - Cloudy and hazy. Foamy and great lacing.
Growler poured into antique German pilsener glass
"Like drink emulsified hops, opaque like orange juice! Flavors are perfectly done!"
From 10/02/14 Notes. 22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. Picked up at the brewery 2 weeks ago.
Purchased a case that was bottled the day before at the brewery.
Growler was poured into a perfect pint glass.
"Review of previous had. On tap. Did they serve me orange juice? Great lacing also. Smells like bitter orange peel. Taste is much juicier. Blend of citrus but not without a great presence of bitter. Carbonation is appropriate and this beer is a bit creamy in a way. Fantastic feel. I haven't had this in over a year. Not sure if they've changed it, but I like it more now."
Poured into a goblet out of a fresh growler.
"From a bottle, pours a bright but opaque yellow, light orange color with a very soft white head. Great lacing."
Bottled 9/9/14 (5 days ago)
Awesome beer!
"A - Hazy, golden-marmalade body. 3 fingers of white, fluffy head. Good retention and lacing."
750 ml received as an extra!
purchased same day as bottled on!!
"Opaque yellow pour with a magnificent white rocky head that stands at two fingers and stays put, textbook lacing in teku."
"750ml bottle dated 8/16/2014, poured into a Lawson's snifter 8/27/2014, at 40F."
"Pours a bright gold with a pillowy cloud-like off white head. It is bursting with citrus. I get oranges, tangerine, and lemon zest. There is a ton of zesty citrus flavors complimented by a soft chalky mouthfeel and a dank, earthy underlying bitterness. For me, this is the best IPA in Massachusetts."
750 mL bottle purchased at Trillium. Poured into a HF wine glass at 39F
Updated to reflect new scoring and newest batch:
"From bottle. Pour is extremely murky, dark golden amber, tight white head. Nose hits you from a distance with a big hop punch. Nose is a bit messy, lots of sugars and malt that aren't really tight but a huge citrus punch blasts the nose. Taste is the same, malt is very sporadic and unrefined, doesn't get too sweet but you can tell this is big. Hops really drown out any other flavor, full citrus blast with a hint of tea and a fairly light bitterness for the hop punch. Well carbonated and semi dry finish. Interesting beer, straight up citrus hop heads dream."
750 ml bottle into a glass
"Bright yellow/straw colored body with a bubbly white head. Loads of tiny bubbles in this beer and it comes through in the mouthfeel. Not sure what yeast is used, but it really brightens this beer up. Loads of carb almost like a bretted saison. Citrus rind bitterness on the tongue and a big fruity and juicy nose. This is really a fantastic and also different IPA. I'd choose this over a lot of the heavy hitters out there because of that. Easy to drink and quite tasty."
Poured from 32 oz. growler. Filled on 4/16/2014.
Poured from a 32oz Trillium growler filled 4/12/14.
"Look: Looks turbid, nice fluffy long lasting head with lacing"
"A - Pours a super-cloudy golden orange. Almost opaque. Nice head forms after a vigorous pour. The retention is decent, and the lacing is nice. All around an excellent looking beer."
"Finally got out to the brewery, while the family was at the Children's Museum. Snuck in just before they closed, sorry guys, but I wasn't the last person either, by far! Filled a few hours ago."
Poured from a 32 ounce growler into a willibecher. This was filled from the brewery half an hour ago.
Poured from a 750 into a tulip.
"Good bar-pour head. Settles to a thin layer of bubbles. Leaves some patchy, blanketing lace. Very cloudy. Gold color with a tinge of green. "
"Drank from a 32 fl. oz. growler purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"32oz growler poured into a Trillium pint glass. Growler filled today, 1/9/14."
The beer comes in a light golden orange with a fluffy white head.
Beer that's been in a growler for a week
Filled a growler today at the brewery.
Enjoyed at the Dive Bar.
Growler &gt; Pint glass
Pours hazy light yellow color with some amber hues. Dense white foam crowns the top. Aroma of hop resins with citrus and melon. Some malt sweetness on the nose as well.
"A-Pours murky and milky. So much haze! The head is a mushroom cap of doughy and froth. The head is damn persistent as well. This looks like it'll be right in my wheelhouse, the murkier the better."
Growler poured into a CBS snifter.
64 oz growler to the dome - call it the cure for the common government shutdown
Fantastic easy drinking IPA. Local so have only experienced through refillables within 3 days of purchase. Bright and has an earthly funk to the hop profile that doesn't impeded it's ease. Continually impressed by Trilliums hop forward stuff and Congress is no exception. This is one of their better creations and should be a constant.
"a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now. it may have been a game changer when it first came out, but it certainly isnt anything new anymore. this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere, and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic, more northwestern than southern hemisphere, but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away, which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa. it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry, while also being drinkable but substantial, round medium body but fast finishing, the right elements of the hops linger too, no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness. it does have some bitterness though, not all juice, and the grapefruity piney flavors, almost assuredly simcoe derived, do have some resolution, but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple, papaya, and juniper that turn me on here. so alive from the tap, almost chuggable for what it is, probably ahead of its time when it was introduced, not decidedly in the middle of whats hot, but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else, including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about. from a flavor standpoint, its great but not revolutionary, but through the lens of quality, its as good as it gets!"
"On tap Mission Dolores, Brooklyn. "
"Draught: this one pours a murky, golden color. There was a wisp of a white head and some lacing. Nice nose! Grapefruit, tropical and citrus hops. The taste is very good. A faint bitterness, and lots of juicy hops. They blend together to make something that is just excellent!"
On tap at Worcester's Armsby Abbey. Legit NEIPA! Turbid plus ample head. Fruit bouquet. Fairly bitter but nice fresh flavor.
"Softer mouthfeel, lots of flavor and aroma, pours a hazy golden yellow. Had on tap. One of the best beers I've ever had."
Had on tap. Pours cloudy bright gold color with one finger white head with ample lacing. 
I've been lucky enough to drink this beer on tap last summer. As good as it gets. Highly recommended; drink it if you ever get the chance.
Lucky enoug that Upright Brew House in the West Village (NYC) was pouring drafts of Susan. Never a surprise to be impressed by Hill Farmstead. 
Hill Farmstead just sets the bar so high. This was absolutely great.
"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro."
Enjoyed a couple pours from a freshly tapped keg while in Vermont. So excited to try this beer. Sipping on Edward prior to so I already have a hell of a reference point. 
25 cl pour at the brewery. Pours a hazy pale orange in color with a finger+ of white head. Aroma and taste have some stone and tropical fruits with a bit of cantaloupe and a heavy earthy note. Everything sounds like something I'd love but this one is just very good as opposed to great.
"750ml swing top growler poured into shaker pint, poured on 8/30 best by of 9/6."
An excellent Farmstead choice if you ever found it on tap.
"Had on draught at The Pony Bar. Good overall flavor and drinkable, but a bit thin to my taste."
"on draft, in a shaker pint glass"
"The appearance was a nice looking hazy bronzed orange color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some messy lacing. The smell started off with some sweet peach, light apricots, light pine blend bittersweet and sound off together really nicely. The taste was bittersweet all of the way through in the previously mentioned flavors running into a nice semi-sweet to bitter citrus aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice bittersweet feel on my tongue. Sessionable enough to want to have with food. Overall, I’d have this again. Its pretty good."
A: Pours a hazy ruddy golden color with a half finger white head.
"Appearance: hazy light orange in color with a 2"" head that slowly falls to a thick surface covering. Nice lace develops."
On tap in DC at Churchkey
Full pour at CK. Pretty gross. Smells great but has a nasty vegetal note that dominates the flavor. Had this same flavor in an off batch of Edward last year.
"Hazy golden yellow, medium head. Dry fruit aroma, apricot, a bit of pineapple with classic HF floral nose on it. Smells like walking through a flower patch after a summer rain. Tons of peach & pineapple upfront, mid palate brings mango and kiwi, some very faint honeysuckle and hibiscus way at the end, finishes with perfect amount of bitter hop and pineapple again. Just a wonderfully delicate citrus hop beer, like ""juice"" but still beer unlike some of these lactose sugar ""juice bombs"" out there. A standard for IPAs. A rare perfect 5 beer in my book."
After a weekend of tasting some of the top 100 beers on a tour around 
On tap at Manhattan in Burlington.
"Poured into a tulip. Very hazy and slightly turbid on the pour with a golden straw color. A modest bright white head that left fairly quickly but left the glass with some sturdy, splotchy laces. The nose was bright: sweet grapefruit, grassiness, mango, and a bit of blueberry. I noticed the grapefruit on the palate first. Not bracingly bitter but not ""soft"" either. The mid-palate was more earthy with pine, berries, grass, and dry bready malt. The finish was clean with a rising bitterness that framed the taste for me. Nice and light-feeling on the palate despite it's massive flavor, but not at all thin. A fantastic beer."
"Completely hazed golden with dense white head, strong lacing. Tropical nose mainly pineapple, other berries maybe. Taste is bitter, not much malt presence, grapefruit juice in an ale. Mouth coating resiny feel with below average body and carbonation."
Hazy orange pour with an inch of white fluffy head
This is excellent. Citrus nose. Exceptional taste. (NYC-T)
"On tap at Malt & Mold. Poured a completely opaque golden orange with a nice foamy head to it. The nose is very fruity with citrus playing lead. The flavor follows the nose, definitely a juice bomb with the slightest amount of bitterness and malt. The feel is medium, decent carbonation, and a quick finish. This one has been on my list for a while and glad to finally be having it. A northeast IPA done to perfection."
A bit more subtle than many of my favorites but definitely makes the cut.
"Had at the Blind Tiger NYC in a tulip glass. Great look to this, classic NE IPA. Big citrus smell setting the stage. Taste was good finish was a little iffy had all the components of a great IPA. Really enjoyed this would love to see it more often."
It's good not great.
"First had 5/1/15 at Nate's house. It was only a 5oz. sample, got notes of citrus fruit inside a deliciously drinkable bitterness. My first and only beer from this highly rated brewery."
"Drank out of a tulip. Beer comes in a hazy light orange/medium gold color. Aroma has huge orange up front with some biscuity malt on the back end. Big orange flavor on the palate as well with a light level of bitterness. Mouthfeel is in line for its ABV range. Overall, an awesome expression of a NE Juice bomb. 95 points!"
"This one felt like a cloud in my mouth. Probably my favorite IPA by Hill Farmstead. Hoppines was perfect, wasn't to strong just the right amount and felt so juicy. Perfect IPA"
"Pours a hazed orange-yellow color with a huge, fluffy white head."
Currently #95 in the Top 250.
On tap at Prohibition Pig
Bottle Date: growler 10/15/16
Had this on tap in Burlington. 
On draft at Hill Farmstead.
On tap at Three's Brewery in Brooklyn 
"On tap, pours a fairly hazy orange with a finger of dense foam that leaves thick rings of lacing down the glass. I could smell this beer the moment it arrived. Classic grapefruit, with some pine and lemon. Taste is similar, along with a little breadiness. Decently bitter finish. Feel is just a touch thin, but wonderfully smooth and creamy. Amazing IPA, one to seek out--though like other HF beers I've had, it is more restrained and sophisticated than punch you in the mouth."
"Look: very hazy, fast fading head, plenty of lacing, light orange color"
Very nice ipa
"On tap at CBC 2016, day 2. Bright yellow with a white head. Citrus hops and honey, smooth mouthfeel, a nice assortment of tropical fruit notes in the background."
"Pored from a growler picked up at the brewery, nice 1 inch white head with lots of lacing and foam around the glass. The smell is of delicious citrus hops. The taste is juicy pineapple-orange with just a slight bitterness at the end. It is so smooth and juicy with no resinous over-the-top bitterness, but full citrus hop flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth, easy drinking, yet still has body to it. Susan is over the top the best IPA I have tasted to date."
Poured from a growler I picked up on 6/28 and kept cold on the trip home.
My first Hill Farmstead beer. Picked up in a growler from the brewery this weekend. Poured into a tulip. 
"As far as IPA's go, Susan is about as solid as they come. Appearance is as you would expect from a HF IPA. Golden yellow and hazy. The aroma is of citrus and some light bready malt. Aroma is solid, but doesn't explode out of the glass. Taste is juicy and smooth with very little bitterness. As with most HF beers, the mouthfeel is soft and incredible. Nothing harsh or overwhelming about this beer at all. Just a solid, well crafted, tasty brew!"
"Had at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. "
Pale yellow with minimal head and tons of cheetah lace.
"On draft. Nice solid beer with a dry, hoppy flavor. Beautiful yellowy orange color. A touch tamer for IPAs but it has a wonderful finish and after taste."
Outstanding IPA. Nice and citrusy.
"On draft at bridge view tavern in sleepy hollow NY. Original juice bomb? If you ever wanted a beermosa, this is it. The hops are ridiculous.  It is like drinking a glass of grapefruit juice. The alcohol is moderate, which is nice. A must have summer beverage."
"An excellent example of the ""New England juice bomb""! A great beer that brings out the citrus in large quantities. This is a very well made beer with a great balance!"
Could Drink this everyday until I die
"Susan looks great as most Hill IPAs do. There's minimal tropical fruit, it's mostly bitter, piney, earthiness. Soft mouthfeel too. It's a good, but not great IPA."
Excellent aroma. Great flavor. Nice and hoppy. Very well made
"Great offering from Hill Farmstead, Susan is a nice hazy orange with 2 to 3 inch head. I smell a lot of orange citrus and the taste is the same. High acidic oranges. Has soft mouthfeel and complexity of hop bitterness that emerges initially then resonates in the back end due to the trifecta of hops. Although I did feel Edward was simpler, I think that Edward edges out Susan in drinkability. To me, Susan lacked a little balance."
4/2016 churchville a bit malty not bad a little sweet
Had on tap in NYC. Pours cloudy straw. Good hop aroma for style. Although nothing but hops in the nose. A bit thin for a pale ale. Almost no malt to round out hop flavor and bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor are the highlights of this beer but that's about it.
Another amazing offering from one of the top breweries in New England. So happy to have the opportunity to visit the magical place that is Hill Farmstead.
White head. Lace. Golden yellow color.
Had this on-tap at Monk's Café. Served in a pint glass.
"Cloudy golden orange with a fluffy medium sized head and good lacing. Big grapefruit notes, lightly tropical, tangerine, underripe stone fruit, and dank green stuff. Lighter end of medium body, smooth with nice crisp carbonation, dry finish and a restrained bitterness. This is about as good as you can get. Fantastic beer!"
Turbid dark orange color with a modest but lasting bright white head. Citrus aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with modest carbonation. Orange hop flavor and strong hop bitterness. Not bad.
"will need to give this another try, had it after Other Half IPA and it was too light on carbonation and feel in comparison. Look was hazy light yellow-orange color, smell was subtle not much citrus, taste enjoyable with lingering aftertaste on back of flavor, Feel lightly carbonated light to medium mouth feel. Overall a solid beer, as I said earlier need to give it a try on its own."
On tap at Armsby Abbey
"Resiny with light, sweet cracker malt. Grapefruit pith, earthy twig; underlying a peppery and sweek mint. Tangerine, passionfruit, stonefruit. Great flavor that echoes the pine and grapefruit aroma. Bright feel, medium bodied on the edge of creamy. Some alcoholic phenols sneak their way in--delightfully so. Fast and active carbonation on pour, hazy but brought orange."
"Had at Whetstone Station in Brattleboro VT on tap on Wednesday night, 2/17. Pours an opaquely hazy goldenrod color with a head that refused to die, left good lacing on the sides of the snifter glass."
Look- hazy light orange color. 
"Had this in 2016-02-06 in Lancaster, PA at Hunger and Thirst"
"L - golden, completely opaque (a good sign), head is small but sticks around and leaves lots of lacing"
Untouchable beer.
"Growler from the brewery consumed a couple days later. Hazy orange, tons of tropical fruit aromas and flavors. A very good IPA but not quite as good as the two Society and Solitude beers I had."
"The only down side of this beer was the look, very cloudy, I think that is a flaw for this style. The nose was almost prefect, it was like smelling hops fresh on the bine. Tropical fruits dominated, but there was a good biscuit smell from the malt. The taste was even better than the nose, piney, then black pepper spice, then mango, and then there was a real hop bitterness. The hop overload(in a good way) was then washed away by the residual sugars from the malt. The mouthfeel was a bit too heavy, but I am not sure how you can carry that much flavor with anything lighter. Overall a great beer, seek it out and you won't be disappointed."
"On tap at Ambulance brew house, into a snifter. "
"12/22/15 - On tap at TRIA in Philly. Served in their signature ""T"" tall stemmed tulip glass. Somewhat cloudy and straw-blonde color. Not too much head. Great hoppy taste with little bite and a nice consistent aftertaste. Refreshingly good. I'll have another just to be sure."
A prefect IPA. Face Melting!!!
An all around great IPA! I'm so impressed by the big juicy hops aroma of this one which seems to be a staple and a quality common to these great Vermont IPAs. Hoppy but not overpowering. Lots of grapefruit rind in the taste and some clean mineral waters. Big dry palate. Smooth.
Worth making a pilgrimage for.
"I can look at and smell this beer for days. A true delight, like every other HF IPA. Excellent hop aroma and hazy pour. Taste is hop forward, clean finish. One of my favorite IPAs."
Got to try some from a day old growler at a share.
Poured into speiglue glass from 2L growler filled 10/17. This is a beyond excellent flagship IPA from HF and one of the better beers I've had from that brewery.
"On tap at BBD's in Rocky Point, NY; pours hazy yellow gold color with a big foamy 2 finger snow white head that stuck around forever and left incredible lacing and a foamy iceberg floating on top that swirled around after each sip."
On tap at some joint in Waterbury.
I tried this on tap at the Blackback in Waterbury Vermont served chilled in a tulip type snifter.
Pours a hazy golden color without much head. Very drinkable and well hopped. Snagged this gem at john Browns smokehouse in LIC queens. Definitely would get it again
"One of my favorite IPAs, period; incredible balance, mouthfeel that is soft / chewy yet still refreshing and clean as opposed to pulpy. Great interplay of tropical fruit, citrus, bitterness, minerality. Avoids anything resinous or piney, with any plant notes being more herbal, grass and leaves."
"From a 2L growler filled this morning, into a cool nonic. A: Nearly-opaque, mango coloured, a thick cap of fluffy suds that lasts and lasts. S: Tropical fruits, herbs and, faintly, sweet biscuit. T: Sticky fruits and sweet buns, herbs and a faint mineral tang. Hops up front overlaying a lightly sweet malty body, easy bitterness lingers long after the last sip. F: Creamy, chewy, absolutely perfect amount of carbonation. O: Probably as great as any beer at this abv range I've ever met. Drinks so tasty, smooth and easy it had ought to carry a warning label."
"Didn't know what I had until I tried some draft at HF recently. Couldn't wait to fill a growler and opened it tonight and am just freekn' savoring one of the best beers I've ever had. I honestly don't feel that I have the sophistication that others have when reviewing beers because I almost 69 and age makes a difference. I just know what I know and this is amazingly fun, tasty, complex but not so anything overpowers anything of the ingredients. Love it. Gonna be back in mid Oct and I can only hope they have this in a bottle."
"holy crapp talk about a beautifully crafted beer - its a juice bomb with massive tangerine orange, but its also one of the most perfectly balanced, delicate & drinkable IPAs ive tried. drink this is you see it!!"
"Freshly poured at the Hill Farmstead brewery in VT. The appearance was almost like a grapefruit juice, but not as hazy, with a thick, one-finger head. The smell was amazing with lots of citrus aromas coupled with some pine and grapefruit in there. The taste on the palate was of sticky-hop flavors, with layers of citrus and somewhat herbal. It starts with sweetness that ends with a decent amount of crisp bitterness. Overall, this is a great offering from Hill Farmstead and a good rendition of an American IPA utilizing New Zealand hops. If you haven't already, definitely check out not only this beer but the brewery as well; awesome place, cheers!"
Another great ipa from Hill farmstead. Super fruity with a nice bitterness and just a touch of malt to balance out at the end. Great mouthfeel and carb for a very drinkable ipa. I could crush this all day long .
"On tap at Threes Brewing (Brooklyn,NY)"
"On tap at The Beer Belly, poured into pint glass"
My absolute favorite!
"L: Hazy, yellow golden perfection. A beautiful fingers worth of white head. Some wonderful lacing left along the way. "
"Poured on tap at Three Penny Tap Room into a shaker pint. Fresh keg, just changed."
"This the the haziest IPA I have ever seen. It smells hoppy, but not overly so. But the taste just rolls across your tongue with layers of subtle hops. It's mellow and smooth so it drinks like a session and the hop subtleness doesn't burn out your palate. Amazing stuff."
"Received this as approximately 2 weeks old via trade. Pours a slightly hazy orange-ish color with exceptional lacing. The Riwaka hops must be what I'm smelling as it's unique (but pleasant) to the nose - a juicy IPA no doubt. This is really a fantastic American IPA and provided a wonderful drinking experience overall. Balanced and delicate fruitiness throughout, subtle dryness on the end."
Great color and nose. Poured into a tulip glass with a thick foamy head. Consistent lacing coating the glass. Just another world class beer from the geniuses at HF
"Pints at Armsby Abby. I wrote this on my phone, where reviews always seem a heck of a lot longer and more descriptive than they end up being."
"Had this beer twice on tap, but never from HF directly, so take that with a grain of salt. First time was around 7/24/15 at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA and then again on 8/10/15 at Torst in Brooklyn. Both times were pretty consistent in every way, but FWIW, a lot of people that tried it at Torst have agreed that it was much less hazy than they remembered and not nearly as flavorful. It certainly didn't taste off in any way to me, and was still a way above average IPA, but not as amazing as I would have expected from HF (again, having never been to the brewery). I will add that the Edward I had at AA was one of the best beers of the year for me hands down, but Susan just didn't hit that level (though I get the sense that it should and would have if up to quality it normally is/used to be..."
"I've had a lot of Susan in my life, not as much as I've had of Abner though. They were both on tap when I went to the brewery and, perhaps due to me being from the West Coast and it's bit more a stark contrast to what I can get there, Abner is what filled most of my growlers with."
"From a growler. Pours out a beautiful hazy sunset orange. Smells of citrus, some malty sweetness, and peaches. Nose follows suit. Such a dangerously drinkable ipa. My second favorite after s and s 1. Crisp and refreshing."
"A - Hazy orange body, short white head, and extensive lacing."
This is about all you could want in an IPA.
A cloudy pale orange pour into my newly gifted Hill Farmstead glass. It resembles orange juice with a fluffy white head on top dissipates quickly. 
"So far this is my favorite Hill Farmstead beer. Had it shipped to me in a growler and drank it pretty fresh. Great smell, flavor, and balance. Susan was bomb."
Foggy a Golden Look
"Fluffy mouthfeel, dry, hoppy bitterness. Grapefruit citrus combined with some mango and orange. Cloudy, yellow with a thin white head. Very good!! One of the best IPA's i've ever had!"
"Pours cloudy cloudy orange. Medium-sized head. Smells like pine and loads of tropical citrus. Taste is smooth and delicious, plenty of bitterness and citra. Goes down way too easy. Creamy and smooth with a dry pleasant finish. This beer was everything I was hoping for."
"From Growler filled @ brewery. 6/10/15. Pours vibrant Tang like Orange, hazy, lacing glass. peach, orange, grapefruit in nose very clean, soft mouthfeel. hoppy in middle. very clean finish. Excellent beer. Would not expect anything less from Hill Farmstead"
An odd opaque color but flavor was full of citrus and low on bitterness which was a nice surprise.
Drank originally on draft at Armsby Abby; had growler filled on 7/22/15 at Hill Farmstead Brewery and drank jn tumbler on 7/26/15
750 ML growler via a good trade partner… Extremely floral nose and taste...loved it!!
"On tap at farmhouse on a few occassions. Floral boozy flavor. Seemed light on the malt, heavy on the piney, tropical, spicy flavors. The aftertaste was minimal, little bit of lemon or lime. Nice and dry."
"Consumed 6/6/15, growler filled at the brewery about 4 hours ago"
"Appearance: Hazy yellow hold. Looks like almost every other Hill Farmstead pale ale. Head is white, fluffy, and dense. Drops to a few clumps of a cap with a small creamy collar. Sheets and splotches of lacing. "
Poured from growler into tasting glass.
Purchased at the brewery last weekend 5/16. Poured from the 750ml growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed snifter.
Drinks very clean with low ABV but so much flavor. Fantastic as usual from Hill.
"Hands down, best beer I've ever had."
Poured from a fresh growler.
"Damn, this a fine beer. "
"Great hop aroma that is very tropical. Light hay in color, which is what I prefer! The taste was very balanced with a slightly bitter finish. Overall it is great, slightly below Double Citra to me, but very close."
"On tap at Prohibition Pig, Waterbury, VT."
As good as I remember. Citrusy floral hoppy bonanza.
Best IPA I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.
Wow. Super smooth. Very great beer!
"Growler, pours is cloudy pale orange, aroma is citrus, melon, and grassy pine. Taste is perfectly balanced and a dry bitter finish, probably my favorite HF IPA so far."
Susan is an apsolute must to get! Amazing!
I've had a fair number of HF IPAs at this point and this is my favorite so far. Though to be honest I like I well balanced IPA.
"Another over rated beer, i like these guys but the way some treat them you think they were gods, they also have better beer then some of the ones that are higher rated"
Poured from Christmas gifted growler from brother in law. I think he's a keeper. Excellently balanced beer. Ridiculously good beer while watching ridiculously bad NY football
Pours a hazy golden orange with a slow fading white head. Leaves the lighest
Definitely one of the best IPAs available. Shaun does nothing wrong.
One of my favorites from Hill Farmstead. Always fill my fridge with growlers when they brew it!
A - hazy marigold in color. Thick pearly white foam with decent retention. Leaves spatters of lacing against the hill farmstead stemware.
A - murky yellow orange. Typical VT IPA appearance. Lovely. 
Poured from a 750 ml bomber into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
"Growler filled at brewery, 11 days old."
"On tap at Hill Farmstead in Greensboro Bend, Vermont, filled two growlers of it."
From notes
It's the IPA that I could get by without.
"Fresh growler shared by Liam, reviewed from notes"
"Great beer, loved it, worth the wait at the brewery to add it to your list!"
"Another shout out to Ineedabeerhere. Pours a dull orange hue with a hazy clarity and a frothy, textured, bright white head. Nose expresses tangerines, simcoe hops and a hint of grain. Taste follows nose - a little less bright than suggested by the nose with the addition of a light, slightly lingering medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight acidity and a carbonation that falls just short of crisp. Overall, very good, but closer to an APA than an IPA in my opinion."
"Hill Farmstead makes terrific beers. Susan is no exception. Juicy, dank, citrusy IPA with a bitter dry finish. Had this on tap at Armsby Abbey. World class offering as usual!"
"A-Pours like fruit juice. Murky, dull orange in color. Nice little head grows and stays put after exhausting some of its stature. Light speckles of lace."
"First had: on tap at Hill Farmstead. But never rated it, so this is from a recent tasting on tap at TJ's, Ardmore, PA."
Poured from a fresh growler into a modified tulip glass.
"Poured a cloudy golden yellow with a beautiful off-white, frothy head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. Great aromas on the nose. Citrus fruits, grapefruit, piney, earthy, and resinous. All of the flavors from the nose swirl around the mouth wonderfully. Light to medium body, a perfect balance. Smooth and not overly bitter. Another gem from one of the best breweries out there!"
"Another one I have had on many occasion but have yet to add a review, well that changes now thanks to a surprise 64oz growler that my buddy maddogg21 dropped off earlier today on his way out of town for a trip to Belgium (apparently did not have time to drink it between the pick up about a week ago and now - who does that? But I digress...) enjoyed from a bulbous hill farmstead wine glass."
"Light orange in color, fairly hazy. One finger head that has exceptional retention. Great malt-hop balance in the aroma, a focus on citrusy hops, with hints of pine. The malt aroma is cracker like, slightly bready. The taste is focused more on piney hop character with notes of citrus and berries. Again a cracker-like malt profile, balance is towards the hops in the taste. Rich, smooth mouthfeel, with a medium body and moderate carbonation levels. Edwards sister beer indeed."
"Had this on tap at the Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. Brought out in tulip glass."
"Pour is a hazed golden amber with a bubbly white head. Nose is powerful citrus and grapefruit hops. Subtle grain notes and a hint of a malt backbone. Taste is so gentle and focused, tropical fruits everywhere, mango, grapefruit, peach skin. Light grain notes. Bitterness is present through the finish with a fairly inviting palate, extremely soft body, crisp clean finish, tropical fruits gently linger. This stuff is darn good."
750 mL growler poured into a snifter. Reviewed from notes.
Enjoyed on tap at the Farmhouse Tap & Grill.
Enjoyed this from a 2L Hill Farmstead growler poured into a Hill Farmstead large wine glass.
"Very soft mouthfeel almost creamy. Tangerine, cantaloupe, and a late hint of pine. Huge nose and well balanced."
2L fill 11/27. 
"Wow...after reading all the Vermont hype I journeyed up from CT last week to see what all the fuss was about. This was my 200th ""tour"" of a brewery and may have been my favorite. You must go just to have the privilege of driving up the dirt roads in the middle of nowwherseville and waiting in line while they bring you 4 generous samples off the taps for $5...I thought heaven would require more effort to get to. "
Growler filled November 15 and consumed on the 17th. From notes.
"2L growler shared with peepz this time around, have had this a few times in the past as well."
"On tap at Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT. Served in a 12 oz tulip glass. Consumed on 11/1."
Growler gives a great pop and fills the glass with a golden body and a long lasting lacy white head. 
Sublimely wonderful IPA
From notes: Fresh growler consumed 10/17
The beer comes in a cloudy golden orange color.
Poured from a HF growler to a long stemmed wine glass.
"A - Hazy, clody medium orange color with a white foamy ring. The lacing is very thick, creamy, and sticky."
"drank so much of this - in and around Waterbury as well as a liter growler to go, and lord it was a lovely time"
A- Pours a hazy orange/gold with a large white head that slowly recedes and leaves plenty of lacing. Beautiful!
"750mL flip-top growler thanks to yourefragile. Moll is the man! Pours a cloudy orange with a medium, buttermilk head. Good lacing. Complete rings. Nose is jackfruit, dragonfruit, serrano hot pepper, pineapple/peach. Taste is chalky, minerally, a tad powdery. Flavor has some funky rind, cantaloupe, peach/pear juicy sweetness. Finish brings nice mellow bitterness. Palate is ultra soft, fluffy, easy to drink. Quenching, cloud like mouthfeel."
"This brew was poured from a refillable 750mL Hill Farmstead bottle, filled at the brewery growler-style, into our Founders snifters. It glows the color of butternut squash, offering up a two and a half finger tall head of soapy, chunky, white bubbles, showing excellent retention. Cratered honeycomb lacing is left all around the glass. A murky haze cuts clarity and remains throughout, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be light. The aroma is wonderfully bright and fresh, giving notes of raw honeys, grapefruit and nectary sweet hops, mineral-laden water and clay, granular white sugar, apricot and nectarine fruitiness, thyme and oregano leafiness, sunscreen soapiness, envelope adhesive, and chalky pale malts. Our first impression is that the flavoring is just as juicy and sweetly hoppy as you would expect, helping to bolster and balance residual bitterness through the finish. As we sip, sour Starburst candy fruitiness, pale and lightly wheaty malts, white chalk and blackboard slate, mineral clay, white grape skins, biting citric rind, and a blend of grassy, nectary, grapefruity, and soapy hops start things off. Moving through the peak is continued freshness of grassy and soapy hops, fresh squeezed grapefruit juiciness, peach and tangerine flesh, booze and orange peel bitterness, green twigs, moderate metallic bite, and light rubbers. The end washes with bitterness of lemon and grapefruit rind, soapy citric and lavender oils, cotton, graphite, manila, white sugar and honey sweetness, residual bitterness of raw barley and lightly toasted pale malts, vegetal metallics, and honeysuckle. The aftertaste breathes of crusted wax, walnut oils, herbal hop bite, well water, resinous tree sap, green olive oiliness, lemon and grapefruity juiciness, sesame seed, dried pale malts, baker’s yeast, fresh grassy hoppiness, creamy milkiness, robust metallics, and denim. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. Each sip gives soft slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop. Following an initial foamy coating, the mouth dries with lightly puckering astringency and chalkiness. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks easily."

"Rich golden yellow in color. Hazy in appearance, but not turbid. Orange and hints of pine. Delicate grapefruit bitterness throughout. Creamy feel with a mellow carb profile. Nice balance."
"Reviewed from notes from two growler fills from 8/8 and 8/9. Made the drive to Hill from Burlington, Vt. two days in a row and waited 2 hours and 3 hours respectively for Susan. Served in a Citizen Cider snifter."

64oz growler
Growler courtesy of msquared2 and split with my Aunt Susan for her birthday. Thanks Morgan!
"Thank you, Eric."
"Pours a hazy golden with a dense, tall white head. The smell is lots of big citrus (tangelo, maybe), with some grassy notes and something sweet like cake batter. The taste is again very heavy on the citrus, but with a strong malt backbone; lots of herbal notes, too. It's a little thick, but well carbonated. Reminds me a lot of Edward, but more amped up. A good beer."
"Drank on-tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
Thanks to Paul for snagging this gem for me. 
"750 growler thanks to Tommy, two and a half week old. Huge pop at the opening, this one was nicely sealed. Intencing danky aroma of onion and weed, some citrus and leaf. This feels like the small cousin of Abner, less powerful but more drinkable. My favourite IPA."
A-hazy golden color with a nice white head and good lacing
"750ml growler poured into HF glass. Fills the glass with a bright hazy orange body and a creamy white head. Pretty much standard appearance for an HF IPA. Bursting with citrus on the nose, especially grapefruit and a bit of lemon. Some floral and pine notes mixed in as well. "
"Big thanks to DaveHack for the hookup o this one. The beer poured out as a nice hazy yellow color with a massive fluffy white head. The smell of citrus fills the air after popping the growler and pouring out into the glass. There is a beautiful soft grapefruit aroma on this. There is a very nice citrusy flavor too with subtle waves of wheat ad grains in there as well. The mouthfeel is soft, light bodied and refreshing. Overall this is a great IPA. Very good stuff."

Poured from a growler into my Lawson's snifter. 
Pours dark orange with a big creamy white head that recedes down to about a finger. Excellent spotty lacing down the glass.
Tap at Armsby Abbey.
Shared a keg of this with my man Rochefort10nh of course...
Poured from a growler friends had filled for me 24 hours before this review. Susan pours a hazy honey yellow with a touch of amber mixed in. A moderate creamy head on top slowly fades away leaving behind a nice netted pattern of lace on the glass. I scored appearance a little high because just looking at this beer makes me anticipate the first sip.
"Enjoyed on tap at Zwanze Day, 2012. Served in a my Zwanze taster."
"Thanks Fitz for sharing this one. Poured into a standard solo cup, it had a golden orange color, with a thin layer of white foam on the surface, some clusters of larger bubbles clung to the sides of the glass. "

Poured from 750 ML swing top into an oversized wine glass...maybe a brandy glass? 
Thanks to Tyler for this one. 22oz. growler into a Lawson's pint glass. 
"Need to thank Dr. H for this treat. Poured from 750 growler into my 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very cloudy orange yellow, with a two inch sticky off white head, leaves loads of lacing behind. Smell is heavenly mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and pineapple. Taste is all of that, with a grapefruit finish. Body is thinner than I expected, not overly carbonated, not dry, and very drinkable. This another treasure from one of the great users of citra hops. Vermont can brew IPAs."
"Was fortunate enough to have Susan back when it debuted in NYC at at the Blind Tiger last November, along with a handful of other HF rarities. The scene was absolute chaos, with the entire place packed floor-to-ceiling and people ordering as many as four 12-ounce pours at a time for themselves; I’ve never seen anything quite like it. I was fortunate enough to score a seat at the bar about 10 minutes before keg-tapping, and got my hands on one of the first pours of Susan ever in Manhattan. Glad I got it when I did, because the sixtel kicked in 30 minutes. "
"Susan: several tastings compiled to one review. On draft sample (1st sample I tried at 12:30pm w/ clean palate) into HF sampling glass, 750 &lt; 8hrs old into wide mouth wine glass, 750 24hrs old kept chilled into HF stemware."
Presentation: 750 mL growler filled fresh from the brewery yesterday and kept chilled since then. Poured into a pint glass.
"On-draught at Monkish - a brewery I haven't been to since 5 years ago, when they were adamant about only brewing Belgian ales...so much for that."
"It looks absolutely divine in the glass. Glowing orange cloudy yellow. Tropical fruit with a dank back end. Taste follows the nose and is somewhat dry with a dank back end. A touch too dank and bitter for my taste. It feels somewhat heavy. Monkish definitely makes good juice bombs but after having a few different ones, I can’t help but feel they are a tad too dank and a touch too bitter. A west coast style New England ipa."
"Everything about this offering looked, felt, and smelt amazing, but was a little bitter for my liking. "
"L: pours thick, cloudy orange with a finger of white head that fades "
"Canned on 1/03/17, ‘Year of the Fog’. "
Type: 32-oz. growler
Canned 9/21/17; drank 9/28/17 @ the Yarchives. 
L - Golden orange with murky body and less than a finger of white head
fresh can (7/21) drank on 7/27/17
"My oh my. So many hops! Smells like a tropical dream, taste is in all honestly a bit over the top. Foggy already has a ton of hops and this takes it to 11."
4oz pour at Sovereign during CBC 2017.
"Beautiful beer. I felt like the most recent release of Foggy was an out of the park, walk off homer. Foggier is a walk-off double (no pun intended.) It's very close to being a straight up 5 but lacking some complexity. Despite that, a phenomenal offering from Lord Henry!"
"4.5 across the board. Pours a hazy light yellow with minimal head. Nose is slightly tropical with citrus and floral mingling in. Taste of fresh cut pinnaple, orange juice and light grapefruit pith. A bite dank with notes of floral a subtle hints of pale malts. Medium body with a slight bitter dry finish."
First glance this is a beautiful hazy beer with next to no seidment. Poured with minimal head. Smell of tangerine and pineapple with subtle dankiness. Taste was wow. Incredibly balanced juice bomb with perfect bitterness. Feel was very soft with a crisp finish. The slight dry bitterness on the backend left you longing for more.
Looks almost like a glass of pineapple juice on the pour. Intense fruit smells of mango and pineapple. That is out of this world juicy with a dry finish that makes you want more. This was everything I hoped my first monkish beer would be!!
No words. This beer is phenomenal.
"Sweet honey peach fruit pineapple taste. Super fruity sweet. (I can't smell today.) Hazy and yellow/cloudy/straw. Low carbonation, super pillowy. Lovely, soft mouthfeel."
"L: Hazy apricot, peach, and honeycomb hues with a foamy white head"
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma is fruity with pineapple and peach notes, also some dank hops. Taste is sweet and fruity at first, some light nutty malt character, slightly astringent citrus, light bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Overall it's a really good DIPA with great hop flavors."
Canned 10/21/16. Consumed 11/21/16.
This is a really solid IPA. Had an entire can to myself. Was great through and through. Very hazy in color and thick on the mouthfeel. One of my favorites from Monkish.
Beer just don't look as good as this bad boy. Pours like a light orange juice with 1 finger head and nice lacing. Taste is pure orange/mango with minimal bitterness and great mouthfeel. As thick of an IPA as you could ask for. One of the better dipa's I've had this year
This is about as close to perfection as it can get. Pours a hazy yellow light orange with anew amazing danky funky aroma. Taste has an amazing dank burst with a great citrus and funky hop balance. Outstanding mouthfeel. Overall an amazing beer that surpasses very high expectations. Definitely holds up to any IPAs from not only NE but around the world.
Holy moly this is a great beer. Foggy window was amazing and this is just another step up! The look is cloudy as cloudy can be. Smell is super dry hopped. Taste is super balanced with strong Hop character. Such a great beer.
"i was so stoked to try this after hearing and reading an awful lot about it, and maybe it didnt travel well to colorado, but i was somewhat unimpressed by this when i had it at hops and pie this week, its a tasty beer, a cool expression of the hops, sturdy and fresh and goof, but it really didnt stand out to me as overly high quality or anything. its rusty orange tinted without a ton of head and a hazy density to it, mucky even. the aroma might be the best part, cut tangerine and orange zest, heavier citra than we usually get, subtle apricot and peach, layered and interesting for a couple of hops i know pretty well. the flavor is good too, starting better than it ends though, fruity and bright up front, plenty of orange character, orange candy, lemongrass, and a little grain sweetness, this is a little bigger than it needs to be right away for me, like i would love to try the original instead of the double, it seems just a little forced. right past the delicious apex of this, it turns green and chemical, over hopped, bitey, less refined than the best of these are by a long shot, and i have no idea if its an age thing, a flaw, or something from transit, but it really makes this pretty hard to drink and seems a shame after such an enjoyable experience up until here. past the saturation point and then a bit bitter as a result, broken down and muddled compared to earlier on, and by the end of a glass, i dont want any more at all, and i am left thinking this isnt any better than anything we have locally here in the same style, and when i think about the ones i have loved from the likes of outer range, trve, and cerebral, i realize this isnt really worth the attention it seems to have gotten. cool that it came through here, but ill need to try it closer to the source i think to get a better feel for it..."
One of my favorites. Love this beer.
"L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a dark orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a 3/4"", foamy, very long-lasting head. Excellent lacing."
"Awesomely good NEIPA. Looks perfect. Big juicy tropical and citrus notes, My only beef is it has a bit of a bite to it. Other than that it's an outstanding brew."
"I've had Double and Triple. Same great taste as Triple Starfish without being such a heavy hitter. This unfiltered beer has a great mouthfeel, perfect level of bitterness."
B- / WORTHY
"loads of candied orange, peach rings, rich doughy honey malt notes, cream, mango, grapefruit, and a touch of herbaceousness that provides a mellow green quality. soft mouthfeel and overall very tasty!"
My Favorite Aslin DIPA currently. Explosion of citrus in my mouf. All aspects of this beer put it with the best NEIPA’s out there IMHO.
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass.
Had a few times and really love this. My jam is citra and galaxy and this is a home run
No canned date
"Drank this out of the can at a Nationals tailgate put on like Aslin. This just reminded me of heady topper for whatever reason - maybe a little sweeter up front, but a very similar nice bitterness. Would love to have this on the regular somehow!"
"Serious orange bomb with soft mouth feel and a hoppy bitter finish. A lot better closer to room temperature than fridge temperature. A touch of ABV heat right at the finish of the hop bitterness that compromises the beer a bit, but that is being really picky."
"Appearance: Pours like an orange smoothie, with the bubble show eventually separating the liquid from the head; two fingers of foam stick above the cloudy orange liquid; excellent stickage that leaves a few shards"
Cans. Orange hazy appearance with good bit of carbonation/foam on the pour. Citrus orange and mango aroma. Juicy flavors. Sweet. Good mouthfeel.
"This one pours a very hazy and murky bright orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
Wonderful. Orange Sorbet/sherbet juice bomb. Notes of pineapple and guava also show themselves. Ever so slight slick resin finish to keep the balance.
"Glass of orange juice with a one finger off white, sticky head. The aroma is full of oranges, dankness and herbal hoppiness. Nice sweet, creamy beer. Tons of oranges and weed and pine. It has a ton of bitterness but a great balance with the sweetness. Killer beer."
"Pours like orange juice. Big white head. Smells like orange peels. Taste orange juice,orange rind. Excellent mouth feel. This hits on all notes. Look forward to more from them."
"look: Dull orange peel color, cloudy, hazy, soft 1-2 finger head from a light, non-vigorous pour"
Another thanks to Drew. No can date.
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with moderate head and not much lacing. Smell and taste are orange, peach, and grapefruit with a hint of vanilla. Alcohol is more noticeable than I expected for 8.3% based on other Aslin DIPAs."
"Thick, hazy look and AMAZING smell and taste! Great orange flavor without feeling artificial"
"Acquired in recent trade and arrived frozen. Doesn’t matter. Thawed, chilled and poured into a tulip with a nice head. Smells glorious. Tastes just as good (I’m a sucker for galaxy hops). If it lost carbonation because of freezing, it doesn’t show. Great beer, comparable with any of the great hoppy beers I get regularly here in the northeast!"
Appearance - Pours thick looks just like orange juice bright orange. Huge thick soapy head that lasts forever. Tons of lacing.
Can from the brewery for around $6. great stuff!
My nephew brought this up after a visit to VA - what an awesome surprise as its my fave brewery.
"Pours deep yellow orange. Aggressive pour reveals big billowing head. MMM smells great off the bat, sweet peaches, fresh pineapple, super orange rind. Taste is like orange/pineapple juice without the acidity. Super good! Feel is very light, low carbonation-trying to feel it at roof of mouth but it is too smooth. Mid Backend is where the hops become present. Virtually no alcohol for a DIPA. More bitter at finish but the smell and taste will keep u coming back. Very well done IMO. THANKS noyoudidnt!"
"Pours a completely hazy orange juice with 1 finger on aggressive pour. Aroma-pineapple, mango, peach, orange. Taste- mango, pineapple, hint of mint, ever so slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is slick, and a little fluffy. Overall- this one is crazy good. Digging it for sure."
Eru food and better than other of their offerings but I won't drive that far anymore when i pass veil and triple crossing to get to these guys! I hadn't had a beer that WOW'd me but i may do in line trades at veil for rhem to give them another shot
Can stamped 07/05/17
16 oz can picked up at Aslin on 7/8. 
This is a sippery liquidish flavorbomb that smells like bitches and fairydust and tastes like black cameltoes in Bahrain. Feels like masturbating on a rainbow. Overall a goodie.
Look: Murky orange super hazy two fingers of fluffy white head. Really nice glass lacing. It looks the part.
16 oz can poured into nonic pint canned on 4/18
Received from @SomethingClever – thanks Dave!
"Wow, this is one intense IPA. Extreme citrus, piney, grapefruit, orange flavors and nose, and big lasting foamy head. Nicely carbonated, with a real bitter dry finish that leaves a tingle and an Ah in your throat! Nice!"
"Moderate pour yields a one inch head over a very hazy body with very nice lacing. Nose of intense tropical fruit, some pine, and citrus. Taste follows nose almost exactly with nice, easy bitterness on the finish. Feel is very nice and overall, another fine offering from these guys from Herndon, VA."
There is no date on the bottom of the can or the label.
Poured from a bomber.
"Probably my favorite Aslin to date. It looks amazing, it smells amazing, a yeah it tastes amazing too. And I love that they bottle it - keep em coming, Aslin!"
Bottled 12/21/16. Consumed 12/30/16.
"Crazy hazy body with a thick, frothy of-white head. Aroma is huge tropical fruity and citrusy hops. Flavor is big and juicy, tons of citrus rind, tropical fruits and fruitcake. Feel is somewhat thick tasting, but drinkable nonetheless. A huge hazy hopbomb all around."
Shared by Matthew. Awesome.
Bottle shared by Matthew. Thanks man!
"Fantastic beer. I had a Heady Topper right after this and it made Heady seem somewhat low key. Anyway, very citrusy in both aroma and taste. Great job Aslin. Get it if you can."
Just diculous - all around favorite DIPA i've had to date. I just discovered this place and went with 2 rounds of flights to sample everything on tap. None disappointed but this stood above the others.
On tap at the brewery 9/22/16
"On tap, pours a super hazy orange with a nice dense head and solid lacing. Smell is a massive hit of mangos, then more tropical fruits and a bit of spicy herbs. Taste is the same. Feel is a rich medium. This is a stellar beer, maybe my favorite from Aslin, which is to say one of my favorites ever."
"32 oz Crowler. Pours opaque dull orange with thin white head that leaves little lacing. Big orange pineapple aroma, weedy hops. Juicy tropical flavored, mostly pineapple n orange. The hops are there as well, dank n weedy, love that combo. No sharp edges, flavors are soft but bold. Medium soft feel. Excellent IPA."
Notes
"Huge, cloudy, opaque, definitely dank! While this was an awesome beer, I truly liked some of the other Aslin IPAs a bit better. Everything about the beer was great, a great example of what a new age IPA is all about! Very nice!"
"Pours a murky, cloudy, orangish, color with a minimal head. Smells of tropical fruits and pineapple and grapefruit. Taste is smooth and orangish sweetness with very little alcohol taste. A fabulous beer on par with some of the best east coast IPA's."
Freshly zested orange peel is definitely the first thing you pick up smell wise and this monster is very juicy. The look of hazy orange juice is definitely an east coast IPA look but on par with green or julius from tree house or trillium vicinity.
"Outstanding. Phenomenal tropical, citrus and dank aroma. Totally opaque, orange hazy appearance. Tastes like the world's hoppiest dank tropical juice. On a level of its own. A beer so resinous, your entire mouth is coated in dankness instantly."
"L: Deep, hazy orange and yellow hues with an ample fluffy white head"
"L: Bright, one yet hazy pour. Almost looks like orange or tropical fruit juice."
"Pours a bright orange hazyness. Smell is the best part of this brew. Straight orange and tangerine. Taste will improve in crowler in time, right now has a light cirrus and orange pith note. Mouthfeel is great. Will update review on taste after I let my crowler sit"
Decent. 
A-Pours a hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing
"A little boozier than I like but, its a beautiful amber beer with a strong citrus and floral smell. The finish is dry and leaves a grassy aftertaste. For a traditional VT IPA this is delicious and strong!"
"DATE: September 23, 2018... OCCASION: sampling another of Jeff's Vermont pickups--FYI, this one is the 8% ABV... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours quite a bright, hazy lemon-yellow body alive with flecks of sediment and tiny, busy bubbles... its head is nearly four fingers of sudsy, soapy, cavernous white that caves in on itself while clinging to the glass--almost too attractive to disturb with a sip... prolonging that, first sniff is thick with juicy resin, lemon citrus, pineapple, mango, and papaya--despite the label, Crusher doesn't suggest any semblance of malt in its aroma... though I would have loved to experience this at 9.6%ABV, the 8% in my glass is plenty rousing, bitter, and Pavlovian in its mouth-watering trigger.... so much so, that the aftertaste lingers almost into its next sip, despite its dry finish.... medium-bodied but a live mouthful... the resin slays the tastebuds, massive and resounding with lemon, grapefruit and mango elbowing everything else out of the profile... light like a Belgian, sneaky with its ABV, great as a dessertif or a nightcap... one of the best one-dimensional offerings I have had, singular in its mission and massive in its effect...."
"Look - poured into an Alchemist IPA glass from a 16 oz can. Beer is lemon yellow in color, hazy, and has a beautiful three finger head with great retention and plenty of lacing. A real work of art."
CAN
"16oz can: This one pours a hazy golden color. There was a white head that leaves some lacing. Nice nose of lots of hops. Citrus, tropical fruits and pine. Possibly a touch of breadiness too. The taste is very good. Just a bit of bitterness, but no real sweetness to it. A wonderful blend of all the aforementioned hops."
A: Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves decent lacing
Best beer in America
The beer glows in a subtle golden hue. It is opaque with a number of floaters coming in the second half of the pour. A honorable head that quickly disapates with nice carbonation. Not as juicy on the nose as other brews from Alchemist but still checked the double IPA box. The taste is crisp but lacks any bite. A nice balance of flavors that put the hops forward but dont allow them to overwhelm the beer.
"Healthy two plus finger head of eggshell white, nice density and retention, even surface maintained as it dissipates, the lacing is average, a few streaks here or there at best. Hazy light bronzed orange color, touch brighter yellow at the edges, bubbles aren’t quite beads but they do gather together in a grouping. Big nose first of malty mocha powder and vanilla icing then pine sap, candied orange peel and sweet tea leaf, the damp herbaceousness too high pitched to come off as outright dank, voluptuous peach, apricot, mango fruit of full ripeness, more approachable than complex. Full-bodied, sappy stickiness adds heft as well as extends the finish for a prolonged period. The carbonation makes a good effort but not able to keep the pace. Develops a metallic earthiness here with coal tar and pine sap in support. Sweet caramel, molasses to dinner roll breadiness. Has its moments of hoppiness but the sweetness wins in the end. Here as well the mango, nectarine, pineapple, peach fruit more like thick slabs than fresh, tart juiciness. Does not seem to be styled for those who prefer keenly dry and bitter IPA’s. No burn but towards the end of the can you feel the alcohol."
This is the best IPA I've ever had.
"A: Dark gold leaning on amber that appears gelatinous at times. Full, ivory colored head. Rorschach styled lacing. Victory DirtWolf comes to mind if that helps."
"Not as good as Heady and Focal Banger (the two other brews I’ve tried from The Alchemist) which isn’t a knock because not a lot of beers are. The most hoppy, bitter, and layered of the three imo."
A: Poured into a tulip glass to a deeply hazy golden orange topped by a finger and a half of dense white head which has excellent retention
"Pours copper amber with haze and suspended particulate matter. The frothy cap is modest but lasts the whole glass, coating it with lace on the way down. Fresh red grapefruit, mango, pineapple and green apple hops in the aroma. The taste is a citrusy hop assault with an unrelenting bitterness. Doughy malt provides impressive balance in the maelstrom. The mouthfeel is full bodied with mouth numbing hop cotton mouth and moderate carbonation. Very high eucalyptus bitterness in the eternal finish."
Can
"Very hazy dark orange pour with a dense white head. Juicy aroma of citrus, pine and tropical fruit. Taste is mildly bitter with citrus rind and tropical fruit flavors initially. A good bit of pine and resin comes out as the beer warms to a nice, lingering bitter finish."
Poured from 16oz can into Snifter glass. No date. 
"Appearance: A careful pour yields all the head I can handle, with the cloudy amber liquid below; excellent persistence and plenty of lacing"
"Orange and hazy with a really nice head. Lingering on glass Aroma is a big floral and malty aroma combo. Really like the aroma. Then the taste and feel combo is just spectacular. Big flavor burst of moderate to high bitter hops but with an extremely soft mouthfeel and creamy and clean finish. More like Pliny or a big Stone beer like Ruination than an NEIPA. But a really, really well made beer."
"Had this on 2018-05-28 in Columbia, PA from a fresh 16oz can"
16 oz can poured into Dogfish Head IPA glass
"Pours a cloudy orange/yellow color. All i really smell is hops. The taste and feel are amazing. Nice clean, sharp hop bitter taste. Equally crisp with a nice dry finish. Outstanding."
"Hazy bright orange, ample head that lingers. Classic, vibrant citrus notes on the nose - passion fruit, melon, grapefruit with a nice dose of grassy hops. Taste is sharper, more bitter grapefruit vibe, overripe melon, very bitter finish. Not as balanced and delicate as the nose"
Sampled by pouring a 16 ounce can into 9.75 ounce Arome Glass.
16 oz can poured into an imperial nonic.
Love it. If this was made by another brewery it would probably be all I drank from that place. The only downfall of this beer is that it often gets overlooked in favor of Heady Topper and Focal Banger. But it is right up there with them in terms of quality and it is usually always in their rotation! (at least in my experience)
"Being a bit over the top on IBUs, I wasn't expecting too much but this is balanced, fresh, dry finish. Just a very good beer. Definitely not a novelty, this needs to get in my rotation."
16oz can undated purchased at the brewery. Hazy amber color and very hoppy/citrusy nose. Citrus rind flavors such as lemon and grapefruit are present along with some orange pith. This was a very hoppy beer and even though we don't think of ourselves as hopheads we didn't have any problem drinking it.
"I think it is better from the can instead of in a glass. Not much to look at. Smell is juicy and dank hops. Taste is bitter, dank, strongly hoppy, mildly juicy. Full mouth feel, strong alcohol presence, just another great beer from the Alchemist."
"First had at The Alchemist Brewery and Visitor’s Center, Stowe, on draft sample into footless goblet, and have had a couple of times since poured from pint can, gift from friends, into pint glasses. This is one great big ugly beer."
"Pours a translucent golden brown from the pint can, but with a massive quantity of suspended particles that indicate a fuller body than I would have otherwise guessed before sipping. No one told me I was supposed to run this through a French press before drinking. A full finger of head produces substantial lacing and retained foam. "
16oz can poured into a snifter.
"A real taste bud crusher. Delicious, but don't try to drink a lesser beer after it."
"Yeah, it's good. Aroma is the best punch in the face you could ever get. Taste is dripping with grassy floral & not quite citrus hops. Different from the fruity NEIPA craze which is putting out some great beers right now but this is a beer for the hopheads. Love it!"
Quite possibly my favorite beer. Does not taste like 9% abv. Alchemist crushed it on this one.....maybe that's where the name comes from?
"Nice double IPA with a kick. Has the ""Heady"" feel with an extra hops finish."
Perfect
Looks a standard shiny golden. Huge nose. Dry finish. Full bodied feel. Nice carb too. Resiny and juicy hop flavor. Cant taste the 9%. Overall pretty well done beer dammutt. Heady still owns.
"From a 16oz can, undated. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
16 oz can piured into a signature Tree House glass. 8% on the can.
"A richly hopped but balanced brew. Mildly cloudy golden amber with a huge head, good retention and lots of lacing . Some chunks of yeast that remind me od Saison DuPont. "
Poured from a can into a 12 ounce tulip glass. Looks a hazy golden orange with decent head and plenty of floaties. The end of the can was chunky but the beer is from early August and is not pasteurized so that is expected. The smell is very hoppy with obvious malt. The taste is a sweet hop bomb with a west coast dry finish. I have to say that it is well balanced for what it going on. Between the high ABV and the over the top hops it is still delicious. 
"Nice hoppy DIPA. Tons of flavor, smooth but still has bite."
"Pours light golden, very clear with an effervescent white head that slowly fades. Very intense hop aromas, lots of citrus, some lemon, some pine and earthy funk. Loads of flavor here, feels like I am chewing on hops (in a good way). Very intense hop flavors, lots of citrus, some pine, lemon, orange pith. Oozing with dank juiciness. Pretty full bodied, almost creamy. Overall this is an amazing DIPA and worth seeking out / trading for. Note: this beer tastes best when drank fresh. This can be difficult to trade for as Alchemist does not date their beers. The beer I am reviewing was purchased (by me) at the brewery 2 months ago and I notice a significant drop off in flavor after 4-5 weeks."
"It pours a slightly hazy yellow with an insane head that stick around forever and leaves awesome lacing behind. The aroma is surprisingly mellow and does not prepare you at all for the upcoming taste onslaught. Insanely chewable, with a great balance of hops and malts but with a very prolonged bitterness that lasts way past the point of swallowing the beer. Lots of dank, pine, tropical fruit and some berry candy. This is an awesome beer."
an incredible non filterd ipa
Appearance: pours a golden yellow color with a short head that creates a thin surface foam.
Look - slight pale copper color and some haze with a great white head and really sticky lacing
straight up- delicious beer. For the alcohol content it is very drinkable. The smell is pure hops and the look is awesome. Orange with sediment pouring out of the can. A really enjoyable drink. I love this.
L: Golden-hued hazy brew with a quickly dissipating head. A thin collar of foam remains with slight foam in the center of the tek glass into which it was poured.
"Drinking a 16oz in a Riedel beer glass. Rich golden color with the slightest haze along with a thick, two finger head. Smells of hops, grass, pine, and spice along with papaya aromas. Smooth carbonation with a medium body feel and creamy texture. Taste of sweet nectar, pine, resin, bitter hops, and spice. A bit on the dry side, but you get that sweetness on the tip of the tongue and a long, bitter aftertaste. An excellent beer!"
L -- Pours a very slightly hazed golden straw body with a two-finger dense white head produced with moderately aerated pour. Good retention and some lacing. Lots of chunky floaties at the bottom of the can -- heed their warning when pouring
"Thanks, Devin. "
L - Cloudy apricot coloured with a nice pillowy head. Pretty inviting
Relatively clear gold with a big white head that's sticky as can be.
16oz undated can.
"Surprisingly clear, with some yeast floaties at the bottom of the can. Pours a nice head and leaves some lace."
16 oz can poured into a speigelau IPA glass.
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Smell is really nice floral, earthy, and lemony hops that is really well balanced. Then, the taste bless you away with hop flavor."
"Smells and tastes very, very hoppy with some definite dank/medical green leaves, some pithy grapefruit, pineapple, a touch of candied orange, and a solid, ever building bitterness. Piney on the back end. I think the fruity flavors are much more noticeable on the warmer end, and it is just a lot of weed when cold. It really works over your taste buds. This is probably the hoppiest beer I have had. "
"Very pleasant aroma of peach, orange and other fruit. Flavour not quite as good. The bitterness is a bit on the strong side, but more notably the alcohol is surprisingly present. The fruity hop flavours are still there, but battle the booze a bit more than is ideal. It's a good beer, but it is not in the same league as Heady or Focal Banger. It probably suffers a bit as a result, because I opened this expecting (or hoping for) another gem, which is a hard expectation to meet. So, certainly very good, but not top notch."
In a snifter the beer was a clear gold color. Tiny white head. No lace.
"Crusher is still impressive but does not even compare to Heady or Focal. There is just way too much booze in this beer. Super overpowering that it makes it difficult to drink in large quantities. There is so much hops that it over takes the palate with bitterness. 16 ounces of Crusher is too much of a good thing. Try it out for yourself, but I would still to Focal given the choice."
"L - Poured from can into glass, got about one finger of white head that faded to a thin layer. Color is hazy straw yellow, a lot of sediment."
"Some say the hop forward Crusher can be ""offensive"" or ""over-the-top."" I couldn't disagree more. Drink it cold and drink it often. it will never disappoint."
Picked up at the pub on 12.26.17. 
"Tasted from can. Pours a golden orange with thick white head. Tons of sediment. Aroma is super fruity. Lots of orange, lemon, passionfruit, papaya, and grapefruit. Taste is moderately bitter but well balanced. Flavors of citrus fruit, floral and resin. Complex and excellent tasting. Goes down super easy."
Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this.
Poured from a 16oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.
"Dark gold, unfiltered hazy brew. Large chunky head forms, eggshell color. The standard Alchemist IPA look."
"Overall a good beer, but I found it to be pretty boozy.....takes away from the taste. Finish is a little bitter compared to others."
"An old friend from college surprised me with this beer when we met up at a party. Very appreciative since this is an awesome beer. Pours very cloudy orange-yellow with a thick, bubbly head and a little lacing on the sides. Aromas are not too powerful allowing you to enjoy the beer without too much of a smell overpowering the senses. Aromas of pine and refreshing orange citrus are what I could sense. Taste is great and follows the nose characteristics with some major orange juicy flavors with a bitter, slightly earthy aftertaste. Great texture to this beer; not too creamy, but a solid body with good carbonation. Overall, this is great across all dimensions, particularly in taste and appearance."
Poured from a 16oz can (NO freshness date!) into a The Alchemist branded Spiegelau IPA glass.
All around amazingly solid beer. Just slightly below Focal Banger and Hellbrook in my ranking of The Alchemist Beers.
Another one I've been seeking for a while
Looks like orange juice.
"This improves with each batch. I'm particularly enamored with this current batch, canned 7/11/2017. (The brewery staff mentioned it was canned the day of purchase which is how I know- still no date printed on cans yet.) Some heavy hoppy beers need time to 'ripen' but this is perfect right away."
Canned about a week ago.
"Received a 16 ounce can from my new friends Louie, Louis, and Al in Williamsburg, Virginia on June 26, 2017. Outstanding IPA. This was my first Alchemist brew and I wasn't disappointed. Can't wait to return the favor to my friends in Williamsburg."
"How does one segue seamlessly from The Eradication/Reduction of The Bottle Backlog at Chez Woody back into what really matters, namely, The CANQuest (tm)? Well, first, you have to jump into Mr. Peabody & Sherman's W.A.B.A.C. Machine, going back to the early-to-mid-1970's. There, a youthful Bro. Woody spent a LOT of time on his maternal grandparents' property, abutting a working farm. A young neighbor girl traded comic books & played tetherball with me. She grew up, married a fellow local beer aficionado & during a recent road trip to VT, they knew to bring me CANs! Viva The CANQuest (tm)! It pays to advertise. "
"Great IPA that packs a punch. I'm an Alchemist fan, and this is a great Imperial IPA."
A slight let down for me. I love Heady and Focal and maybe I expected too much. A fairly tasty beer but nothing I'd go crazy tracking down. Not very well balanced IMO. Good - but not one of the Alchemist best.
"So thankful to have had a chance at a few cans of these, almost at random."
"Medium-gold color and clear, save for a ton of floaties and sediment... Finger or two of ivory head trail some lace behind and slim into a foam cap. Aromas and flavors decidedly dankly tropical - like pine resin shellac on mango, papaya, and the like... Medium-bodied with some chew... Bitterness is fairly moderate but lingers well past the sip, overcoming the sugars and coating the tongue. Not sure of the hops or can date, but I liked this plenty, though I'd not put it on par with Heady or Banger, even understanding it was a different animal entirely."
"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a burnt hazy orange color with a slim finger’s worth of white foamy head, barely any lacing and kinda messy for what is there. The aroma starts off with sweet papaya with some mango warming up with some sweet to bitter danky onion. The flavor starts danky bittersweet. Onion, papaya and mango flow together to combine that danky to tropical fruit bittersweetness. Aftertaste is the same with a quick wet bittersweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sipping to sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs light, feels good. Light throaty hop burn without alcohol burn. Overall, really great beer, it’s really worth the hype. Maybe not Heady or Focal level, but this is up there."
Appearance- Hazy as hell just daunting me...
Pours a hazy pale if that makes any sense. I can't pick out a singular smell. Taste is bitingly hoppy and then some as I swirl it around. And I'm not tasting it five minutes later which is what I am not a big fan of. Mouthfeel- yup there is some! Plus it's just a great beer from The Alchemist. Super glad a trip to the area got me some time there. AND some super beers.
So much hop flavor you're practically chewing on them while drinking.
"Smelled like poop... no joke... taste was good, tried to get past the smell which was very hard. I would try it again if I could get and just hope that smell was a rare occurrence. Lots of sediment as well in this beer. This was also just canned this past week. Love all other alchemist beers but geez that smell...."
Consumed 5/10/17
Can may have been a bit old
"Slightly hazy golden color with a big white head and nice lacing. Big hop soaked dank aromas. Notes of intense citrus, pine, dank and herbal green resin. Medium and dense mouthfeel, lush and smooth with a dry bitter finish. Simply stunning dank and world class DIPA."
Top alchemist beer in my opinion. Good aftertaste from the terrific hops.
talk about a hop bomb! love this beer. The initial smell will knock you back for sure and the first couple of sips are mouth numbing hoppy goodness. the only criticism I have of this beer is that the aftertaste can linger.
"Can poured into snifter; hazy golden yellow in color with nice head. Citrus, resin, hops to nose- dank, dank, dank! This first sip is like bitting into a grapefruit! Very nice. Bitterness is balanced."
"Not quite as intense as Heady or Focal Banger, and the alcohol is a little more noticeable, but still a very good offering that I feel many will enjoy. The can doesn't lie. Be careful, it can sneak up on you."
L: dark amber color with solid white head and some lacing. 
"Pours a medium hazy orange color...not sure how old this can is but there are tons of floaties. Aroma is dank and juicy, pine and peaches blast through. Flavor is nice and medium bitter, creamy smooth and rich. Delicious double IPA."
Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip
"Look: Orange, fairly hazy, with big fluffy head that sticks. Medium carbonation."
"i regret pouring this into a glass. chunky mess. otherwise good head, lacing, retention. orange hued. really hoppy stuff here. good flavor very sweet finish as well. not a bad DIPA, glad I got to try it, but there are plenty of good Doubles out there that I would be willing to grab instead these days."
Hook up from my Vermont Grooms Man. Poured a nice golden color with some floating yeast. Smell was citrus with the pine resin I was expecting. Taste was citrus - orange and grapefruit followed by a nice subtle pine. The malts held the beer in tact so it was not a real palate crusher. This was a great beer to celebrate my weekend festivities. Luckily I think he will grab me some more for an upcoming visit.
"A: Pours a hazy gold with visible sediment chunks, slightly frothy, but visibly viscous. Sticky lacing"
"A superb beer for me. I loved the dirty suspended chunks floating in a lovely color of a beer. Great taste, great aftertaste and overall a wonderful beer. This is as good as it gets for me. Hardest thing is its a darn hard beer to get."
"Poured into an IPA glass. A moderately hazy golden-amber color with a thick and foamy white head. Great retention and lacing in the glass. The floaties danced on the rising bubbles, reminding me of a hoppy and happy snow globe. Bright aromas of grapefruit, blueberry, pine, and resin. Bracingly bitter on the first sip. Huge earthy, dank flavors mixed with grapefruit pith and pine. A clean and slick dry finish. Not at all boozy; just an amazing beer."
"The aroma is of banana, bubble gum, sweet white wheat bread, and a touch of sourdough bagel. Taste is mostly of semi-sweet white wheat bread, with essentially no bitterness, but with a shade of spice"
"LOVE the Alchemist, but this is overrated folks. Too malty and too sweet."
"Just about the hoppiest beer I know that's also drinkable, whatever that means. Highly alcoholic (9%), but you don't get overwhelmed with alcohol sensations as you drink it, so take care. I'm not an extreme hophead, but I like this kind of IPA from time to time. Finish is very dry, but it sends me back for another swallow."
"Poured a cloudy yellow-gold body with two-finger head that stuck around for a while. The aroma is intense as it reminds me of a light, floral, citric bouquet. The hops have a biting acidic pulpiness to them yet beer is real smooth while maintaining a thickness not accustomed to DIPAs and then boom!-sweetness on the backend (like a mild grapefruit). Great balance, slow sipper, great beer and man is that ABV hidden."
"Pours a golden orange honey color with a one finger pillowey head. The aroma is grapefruit, resin and pine. The flavor is tropical and weedy. It has a citrusy flavor up front with a bong rip finish. Solid beer, not as good as focal or heady, but still good."
"This beer is special. Dank nose. Weed and grapefruit. Not sure there's a beer with a better hazy, yellowy/golden look with bits of debris floating all over. Taste is as bitter as I've had. Makes this a palate destroyer-thus the 4.0 rating on the ""feel"". Not the smoothest that I've had but definitely a special beer."
Www.beertodaybeertomorrow.com
Damn this one packs a punch!!!!!! Pours out a light amber dark gold with a pinky finger of head. The aroma is big orange with pineapple and a little mango followed by Mellon and pine.
"Solid beer. Easy drinker if that can be said for a beer with this much alcohol. Compared to Heady Topper and Focal Banger, it is unexceptional but that is like damning with faint praise. Try it if you get the chance."
"I poured a small sample from the can so I could make some notes on the appearance but most of this pint was consumed directly from the can. Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow gold in color with a finger of white head. Aroma is resiny pine and grapefruit, from the can the focus is on squarely on the pine notes. Taste starts with some pine and grapefruit then adds pineapple and stone fruit notes with a solid bitterness in the finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a bit of slickness from the hops. Overall this is a tasty brew, it hits all the right notes for a DIPA."
Awesome beer fresh fruity taste with a strong smell of orange and zest with a smack full mouth feel
Pours out a very hazy/murky golden orange.
"Mango, papaya, honey melon, orange and citrus rind. Nice pine, bitter, dry finish. Definitely some underlying boozy malt sweetness. Pretty good, bordering on too heavy."
"Aroma is full of sweet pineapple, apricots, some caramel and pine cones. A dry crisp bitterness rides the entire length of the palate and then lingers. It's quite aggressive but as it warms the bitterness fades a little and becomes drier which is a much better balance with the stone fruit sweetness and slightly sticky caramel."
"Pours a golden color but I could do without the hop sediments. Aroma is pungent hops, lots of pine and resin. Flavor follows the nose. Very resiny hop forward taste. Has a nice body and overall a very enjoyable beer."
Big citrusy aroma. Robust hoppiness with woodsy overtones.
"I thought overall this was a very balanced DIPA. Very unfiltered and was decent. I'm going to drink it out of the van next, I wasn't that crazy over it poured into a tulip but it was good...."
Nice Orange Haze when poured into a glass with little flakes of goodness at the bottom but I definitely prefer to drink straight from the can as I do with most of the alchemists beers. Has nice tropical fruity smell with a nice hoppy aroma as well. Has a very juicy yet hoppy taste with great balance of the 2. I has a nice crisp clean finish making this hands down the best DIPA I've ever had. Better then Heady and Focal in my opinion. This is definitely worth the trip to Vermont all day.
"No nose, oozying with hop flavor through the crisp finish. No pine or sap."
"Pours thick into a tulip glass, orange haze, three very frothy fingers of white head. Some fair chunks of sediment here settling to the bottom. Leathery hops, hemp oil, pineapple, mango, the faintest whiff of alcohol. Bomb of bitter hops off the bat makes this a bit of a palate wrecker, though I get some resinous oils, burnt citrus peels and the like in there. Very full mouthfeel, clean finish, but dangerously delicious at 9%."
"no denying this is amazing beer, tough one to come by, thanks to my homie for shipping a can out for me. i really like this, its about what i expected it to be, and is right there with the others they make in terms of how awesome it is, worthy of its hype. the appearance is odd, at first its perfect, a hazy orangey honey colored dense beer with a tall white head that rises above the rim of the glass and holds on long, super pretty, but a closer looks reveals some really fishfoody sediment, unsexy, sloppy, chunky, and lots of it. hazy is cool with me, but this kind of obvious particulate in the beer is a problem. the aroma and flavor more than make up for that, heavy hops all the way, both oily and bitter as can be, but also with a biting orange citrus element to it, and a grassy herbaceous freshness, green tea sort of, powerfully alpha intense, and really the essence of the hop cone itself, its gorgeous. freshness is on point here, the citrus is distinct, and it packs a good bitter punch in the finish, and the burps are bitter too. very much an ipa, not a juicy bomb or a pure dry hop thing, whatever the kids are calling them these days, its a more balanced and overall more complete and better beer than anything that is trying to be its peer out there. some pine and orange in the finish too, oily and dank on the tongue, fluffy though, and absolutely wholly satisfying. this is famous for a reason, and while i wish my can wasnt all chunky, the flavor of these hops is what its all about! crazy its as strong as it is, it put me over the edge, but i ever detected it in the least. this was my first hoppy beer after a little beer hiatus, and man oh man it reminded me why i love beer so much. not sure i am prepared to call it better than heady or focal banger, but it certainly belongs on the same table. a rare treat to have ipa this well done!"

"Picked up a 4-pack from the Alchemist while in Vermont a few weeks back. Stored cold since then. Pours a cloudy/hazy yellow with white head that eventually fades to a thin lacing. Smells dank, resinous with lots of pine & citrus hop aromas. Like most Alchemist beers I've tried, it's like opening up a bag of fresh hops. Just great if hops are your thing. Tastes is more bitter than other Alchemist beers but won't take the enamel of your teeth. All the hop aromas are packed into the flavor. At 9% ABV it's surprisingly light to medium but very refreshing. Aftertaste is pure hop resin. There is some very faint light malt character but is obviously in the background. No warming or solvent notes but the alcohol does eventually kick in. I feel like this beer is like Heady Topper on steroids. My only complaint is that this beer is not as approachable or one you can have two or three of without getting wrecked for the night (or day, if that's your thing). Completely in your face. Like the can states, ""if you want some more?"" Well, they definitely put in more hops. Cheers!"
"Straight from the can oh man oh man... This brew is dank and juicy and a true hop wallop. So happy I was able to have it on an unlikely whim. If you have the chance, seize it!"
"Poured slowly straight into a 12oz snifter, a hazy, opaque fiery orange liquid turns to white foam at the top. Head formation peaked at three fingers, with just below exceptional retention. Lacing is prevalent after each sip. Aroma is decidedly light bodied, but hoppy. Orange peel, lemon zest, and grapefruit give a citrusy, fruit quality to it. Faint biscuit malt notes add a little strength to the aroma. Flavor profile opens up slowly, with notes of orange and lemon zest right on the front. As the flavor profile crescendos, and hits its stride, notes of grapefruit, and papaya add to the citrusy flavor. Biscuit malts mingle at the back, providing a little extra oomph to the otherwise hoppy flavor profile. Despite all the hops, flavor profile is balanced and - pardon the pun - crushable. Mouth feel is smooth, with a medium-thick thickness. It slips down smooth and clean. Overall, a delightfully quaffable hoppy beer. With the ABV sitting at 9%, and the overall balance of this beer, this may be one of the more dangerous beers out there. "
"L: Deep, rich gold with a 2-finger head that stays around for a while."
"Pours gold with a big bubbly head in my snifter. Aroma is huge tangy hops, tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is big passionfruit with a sweet light malt backbone, finishes dank and bitter. Texture is soft and smooth. Great beer."
"A bit overpowering, almost pungent on the nose and tongue. I like big hops but this is big to the point of burning the pallette."
Type: 16-oz. can
Poured to a tulip glass.
"Nice dank herbal IPA here. Hazy light orange pour, 2 fingers of head and webs of lace. Dank aroma, pine, resin, caramel. Pine and orange up front, weed, citrus peel, caramel like malt balances this nicely. Medium body, slick mouthfeel."
Damn near perfect. Hazy and smells very dank. Pine needles and citrus on the palate with moderate bitterness. Very crushable despite the almost 10% ABV. Would smash again!
"Pours golden with light haze. Lots of suspended sediment. Medium, white, short lived head."
"Drank some from the can, then poured into a glass and it had a nice 2 finger white head that faded slowly and left good lacing but the amount of sediment floating around was off putting and almost disturbing."
Appearance: straw to light gold with a white fluffy head 
sample from a friends 16 oz can
It will crush you!
"Pours burnt orange with a nice white head. Nice lacing with a nice white head that fades slowly. Aroma is pine needles, hops and citrus. Taste follows the nose with lemon zest. Bitter middle and hoppy finish. Very well made."
A: Not quite as cloudy as the other Alchemist beers. Pale yellow with a thin head
"First off, this beer is amazing. Best one to date of all my BA ratings."
Drank 07-11-16. Scored this on Phish lot.
"Look: Is a solid light orange that you cannot see through, isn't the best looking color but I can respect this none the less."
I have been waiting to try this one. Poured a murky tangerine color with a good amount of thick white foam. Nose is very dank and herbal with a faint tropical fruit background. The flavor is resinous and bitter upfront with some fruit sweetness breaking through slightly. The feel is smooth and thicker than most DIPA's. This beer is amazing and lives up to the hype! A bitter hop bomb with great fruit flavors to balance it out.
"First had 8/13/16 at Musikfest. Profound hop profiles, but still drinkable. Super sneaky ABV, but it's more refreshing than Heady. Focal is still my favorite from Alchemist though."
"This beer is exploding with hops. Dank, dank resin and pine, pithy citrus peel, grass, and herbal notes all cranked up on high volume. Mouth feel is medium to full with a light layer of slick resin to complement the bone dry hop finish. Well done. This a great beer to experience."
like smoking a bong of hops
"This beer tastes like a slightly upgraded Dogfish Head 90 minute to me. It is quite sweet and the hop profile is too mixed for me to make out strong identifiable notes. Its a good beer, but I expect more from Alchemist. This is definitely my least favorite of all their offerings (I've loved everything else I've had from them). To each their own, but if I wanted this experience, I'd save my money and effort and just pick up a 4-pack of 90 minute."
"drank from the can, but poured a little out to check the color. somewhat hazy orange, on the darker side. smell starts off with a good amount of pine and resin and a lot of citrus, no malt on the nose. taste is big lemons and dry orange, followed by a dry resinous finish, the malt is there but every time i try to focus on it the hops cover it up. feel is pretty much perfect, good brew from Alchemist. i will say that i expected to like this better given how much i enjoyed heady, but this is a whole different style of DIPA. very west coast."
Poured into a 22 oz pilsner holiday glass not sure of the date. Pours a very attractive orange with a 2 inch sticky white that leaves plenty of lace. 
16oz Can
Another great alchemist beer.
look is dark orange haze
"Many cans of this were consumed over the summer and autumn months this year. Several of these were consumed sitting around campfires throughout New England. A bitter hotter than Focal Banger and Heady Topper. Full bodied with dank, hop resins. Juicy with medium-high bitterness. Really solid beer, though it's my third favorite of the Alchemist trio."
My favorite of all their IPAs.
Quick review of Crusher. 
"Amazingly smooth, incredible feel, truly lovely hop aroma, such an outstanding beer experience, I feel blessed to live reasonably close to Vermont and to have a friend who lives in Charlotte."
FROM THE CAN
"Had this in a lineup of NE ipas, this was far and away my least favorite. Decent hop notes on the aroma, but nothing compared to the other beers. Flavor is very deep hop character, but again, lacking in robust dry hop. Pretty bitter. This was probably good in like 2010, but we are well beyond these west coast ipas"
"Pours a hazy golden color with beautiful white head. Aroma is intense. Sweet citrus fruits, pine, and a slight amount of alcohol. Taste is a hop explosion. Ripe citrus fruits with lots of grassiness. I do taste a little alcohol, but at 9%, it's hidden enough to make this extremely dangerous. It's quite bitter, but not to the point of off putting. Mouthfeel is slightly above medium. Another great hoppy beer from the Alchemist. I still prefer Focal and Heady, but Crusher is certainly in that range."
"Looks beautiful, and has that amazing citrus-fruity hop explosion smell familiar from other Alchemist beers. For me, those are the high points. Taste follows, but is a bit harsh, and the alcohol certainly isn't masked. "
"Wow, so good! Pours a very hazy copper orange, the smell is overwhelmingly great, citrus fresh dank. Taste is up front bitter, very bitter yet somehow perfectly balanced. The feel is chewy and I mean that in a good way. I over the top good, the drive was well worth it."
"This beer is unbelievably astringent, and nukes your palate with the force of 10,000 suns. The pour is so hazy you won't believe you're not getting 100% sediment. Excellent, but I can't imagine drinking an entire pint of this by myself."
"Pours a golden color, very cloudy, with minimal head that dissipates to a light ring. Mostly tropical fruits with citrus and grapefruit. Light floral. Again hit with the tropical fruits. Orange, pineapple, and grapefruit, with floral flavors at the end. Alcohol is noticeable. Medium light body and carbonation."
Can poured into a Sam Adams glass
Wow. I'm eternally in your debt jhavs. 
"Pours golden-orange and hazy with a fluffy head (disappears quickly). Smells resinous and fruity. Tastes piney and fruity, with a citrus-peel bitterness on the back end. Bitterness mellows out as you drink, though, and the fruit becomes more prominent. Boozy and warming from the alcohol, smooth drinking, pretty fizzy up front, lighter body. It feels like it wants to be dry, but isn't."
"Pours a light, bright, golden orange with a three finger head. The look and body are quite nice and the head is frothy. Smells of peppery hops and citrus. Taste is hoppy and biting, very hop forward and crisp. Lingering bitterness and dryness. Citrus not quite as present in the flavor. Somehow the booze is well hidden. Likely masked by the bitterness. Overall, not a bad showing from The Alchemist. Personally prefer Heady and Focal."
"This is a solid beer. It has world class written all over it. I'd say it is a bit more bitter than Heddy but it balances out in the end. For a dry finish, it is less exciting as Heddy or Kern's CITRA DIPA."
"Have been having this on back-to-back days with Heady and Focal. The Crusher has a similar hop profile to the other two, but is slightly more opaque and has a marginally better mouthfeel. Delicious beer (as you'd expect), and with a little less bitterness MIGHT be my favorite of the 3. Either way, I'm glad Kimmich sticks to his guns and brews these the way he wants, because while a lot of other breweries are cranking out similarly-flavored beers, The Alchemist manages to cram more flavor into each sip than most of them. Fantastic beer."
"This bristles menacingly with fresh, pungently raw tasting tingly hop goodness. I couldn't find much in the way of delicate tropical fruit. Just wave after wave of juicy, incredibly fresh tasting citrus and some ganja sweetened by just enough bracing caramel balance. Aptly named."
"16oz can. Pours a hazy brownish orange with an inch of frothy white head. Tons of lacing. The aroma resinous with pine and tropical fruits. Smells a bit boozey. The taste is more ripe tropical fruits blended with some alcohol heat and pine. Grapefruit, orange peel, and mango. Pine at the finish with some herbal notes. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic beer."
"Poured from a can into a teku glass. The nose is pine-dominant. The palate follows the nose. Dank hops give way to a resin that is more extreme than that I've tasted in any beer before. The palate is hops slathered with pine sap. It's an unbelievable IPA that doesn't rely on any gimmicks for its rave reviews. This is pure, unadulturated IPA - well crafted, and singular. An excellent, dry finish (almost like a crisp, dry, white wine). Mouthfeel is on the thicker side for the style (medium thick), with mild carbonation. This is an exceptional IPA that stands among the best of the best - near the apex of modern IPA tradition."
L: Gorgeous. Nice and hazy brilliant golden orange. Huge white head that hangs on and leaves some nice lacing.
Pours a hazy orange gold with about a thumb and a half of fluffy white head. The head breaks slowly leaving a skating rink of white foam and some nice lacing. 
A big thanks to Keith for bringing this one over for a solid night of beer tasting. . . .
"A- Tallboy poured into a goblet with a slightly milky hazed pale golden body and a thick, creamy white cap. That head makes it up past a finger high with very good retention before dying out to a foamy, wide belt at the edges. Lacing begins fast with large sheets giving way to spotty patches."
The Alchemist Crusher
Everything I expected from an Alchemist IPA. Aroma exploded from the glass and the flavor was very on point. Balanced and easy to drink. Loved this one
Can Date: purchased 10/14/16
Got a four pack of 16 oz. cans directly from the brewery. 
"Undated can into pint glass. Pours a cloudy orangeish-amber (not one of the best-looking brews I've seen). Initial impression is pine resin, followed by citrus (orange, grapefruit, mango) and eventually some maltiness toward the end. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Dry, slightly bitter finish. Alcohol isn't particularly well hidden, although this beer tastes so good that you can kind of ignore the booziness. This isn't as good as Heady, nor is it as good as a few DPIAs from other brewers, but it's damn good."
"Hops are intense... doesn't have the balance of heady or focal, but a super dank smell and taste. Feel is creamy with a mostly dry, but slightly sticky feel. Not going to taste much after drinking this, but it's well worth it."
"Pours hazier than other Alchemist beers, pale gold with a nice head. "
Appearance - Pours a cloudy orange with huge thick off white head that lasts forever. Excellent lacing trailing all down the glass.
"Appearance: Cloudy lemon drop yellow, with a nice multi-digit tower of bubbly white foam head, amazing retention and stupendous chunks of lacing as it recedes. If you don't drink from the can you will notice a few chunky floaties, but nothing too detrimental. And truly, kind of expected."
16oz can into a pint glass. Thanks Jonathan Hand. No freshness dating.
Pours a papaya juice orange hazy body into my new surly tulip. Sediment sinks to the bottom of the glass. The beer is a little over a month old. Head doesn't last forever but leaves decent lacing.
This beer should definitely be higher on the top beer list. Great all around. I'd say second best beer from the Alchemist. I thought it was much better than Folker Banger but not quite the Heady Topper. Top 10 beer for me all around.
Acquired in trade.
"Poured 16oz can into snifter. It has a cloudy deep orange color with 2.5 finger white head. Fantastic retention and lacing. The aroma is dank and very hoppy with tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange and some bready malt sweetness. Flavors of tropical fruits, grapefruit, pineapple and hints of mango with a bit of dry pine and malt sweetness on the finish. Medium body that is stick, but finishes nice and dry. Just another superb IPA and not one that I recommend you 'crush.'"
"Pour is a medium orange hue, seems a little more hazy than heady or focal. Frothy white head that settles to a rather large ring, nice lacing. Aroma is a bouquet of fresh hops, bursts of pine in the background with a subtle hint of tropical fruit. Mangos, pinneapple, papaya. Hop forward taste as expected, big sappy pine with a finish of peppery like sweet malt. Not much tropical fruit detected, definitely earthy, intensely bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, hoppy palate coating goodness. Overall this is like heady on steroids. Interesting intense hop profile balances well with the subtle maltiness. Great beer."
"This smells like you dipped your face into a huge vat of fresh hops. Smells like pine. grass, lemon, grapefruit, resin, fresh greens, etc etc. The taste is expected, liquefied fresh hops and grapefruit juice. Very boozy and bitter, but not in an off putting way. To me still not quite as good as Heady or Focal but a solid beer no doubt."
"Considering how much I liked Heady and Focal Banger, I figured for sure I'd love everything about this as well. Not so much..."
Thank you jhavs for this
"Didn't even bother pouring it into a glass. Amazing DIPA - such a complex flavor profile despite the big ABV chassis. Citrus, pine and big bitter hops lean against a supporting malt backboard that's neither too sweet nor detracts from the hop showcase. Crisp, clean, bright and bitter, this beer should be a sipper but it's easy-drinking; it goes down quick and crushes not only your palette but also your tolerance. Remind yourself to slow down and enjoy it. It's unreal how there's a subtle cascade of flavors with a near 10% ABV."
"Props to BierRunner who scored me a 4 pack of all three from Stowe and kept it nice and cold -- there really needs to be more Alchemist south of the Mason-Dixon. No surprises here -- big huge hop flavor -- mostly resin, but a few hints of citrus at the end. As with Heady and Focal, delivers that huge bite but doesn't leave you feeling like you just smoked a cigar and need to scrape your tongue. Very drinkable - maintains a balance even with the hop explosion. 9.6 ABV very much hidden. Another superior product from the folks at Alchemist. A great way to start the weekend,"
16oz can into a Surly teku. 
"A - Pours an opaque, golden orange with a thick off white head."
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass—Jester King stemware, as usual. This was purchased at the Stowe brewery about two weeks prior to consumption, and refrigerated consistently since. Must be two to two and a half weeks old, max, at the time of consumption. "
Crusher is another exceptional brew from The Alchemist.
"Picked up at the brewery, enjoyed three days later."
I poured this beer and had ton of floaties in it so looked nice hazy orange but floaties take some of the appeal away. not much nose to me. wierd considering the abv and hype. taste is really bitter with topper esque notes playing into the brew. overall I like topper better. this beer is quite harsh and bitter which is not bad. but the drinkability is low and although it is a good beer one at a time is plenty for me.
Beautiful amber hazy appearance with descent foam head upon pour.
Tap at the brewery: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of intense green juicy hops with some citrusy notes is really enjoyable. Taste is a nice mix of green juicy hops with some citrusy notes and some residual sugar notes are also noticeable. Body si about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Another superb hoppy creation form this incredible brewery.
Pours golden with a flakey biscuity head. Sweet tropical fruit aroma. This beer is like Heady on steroids and HGH. It is aggressively bitter and the sweet boozey malt is a hammer to the head. There is nothing sneaky about this. It is loud and abrasive.
"From the can, pours a very hazy dark orange. Two fingers of dense, off-white foam leaves a little lacing. Smell is peaches, pineapple and some sweaty, piney dank. Taste is fruity, along with spicy herbs and some resinous bitterness on the back end. Not much alcohol taste at all. Not getting much malt either. "
"The beer comes in a light gold color, very creamy and hazy looking."
Can received in trade with rej.
"Juicy, dank, pungent and weedy. This is a powerhouse of a brew that does not shy when I comes to hops. Overtakes the palate with waves of tropical and citrusy fruit with weed/dank notes and some malts."
"16 oz can. Pours hazy deep orange, thick white head slowly fades to a pile in the center, lots of sticky lacing. Weedy hops fill the nose. Taste is semi-sweet malt balanced so well with dank earthy weedy hops. Some citrusy juiciness in the background. The hops linger perfectly with the sweetness still there in the end. So much flavor in this brew. The to medium slick feel, ultra dry finish. Dangerously drinkable and flat out delicious. Gotta get some more."
L - Hazy light orange with two fingers of head and some sediment on the bottom of the glass.
"thanks to Brandon for the share, enjoyed from the can in a glass chilled. "
Talk about tropical fruit! 
Drank from a 1 pint can
"From the can at Lockn Fest. Enjoyed from Ice cold through room temp. Had a heady earlier in the day and this thing blows it away. Juicy, creamy mouthfeel, lots of citrus. Less pine than heady. SO easy to drink, really enjoyed this beer. Glad I had an opportunity to try it. Definitely one of the best IPAs Ive ever tasted."
"This is an amazing beer, even better than Heady Topper. It starts with citrus and finishes with a refreshing bitterness. I drank it out of the can as the brewmaster recommends so I can't comment on the look. But the smell is wonderful and the mouthfeel is excellent -warm and smooth."
Shared 16 oz can.
16oz can into a Spiegelau stemmed tulip glass.
"Look: hazy, light orange, little lacing, and worst floatie/sediment buildup i have ever seen in one of the 6 or so cans that I have had"
"This beer is a beast. Reminds me of a mini Palate Wrecker with just a tad more drinkability. Once you get adjusted to massive hop bitterness, it's pretty impressive. Not surprised."
Can courtesy of Schlimenhaumer.
From 16oz. can into standard pint glass.
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Acquired from Carlos who bought this 2 weeks ago at the source.
08/26/2016
"Pours a murky yellow/orange with a half-inch khaki head that remains as wisps on top and leaves faint spots of lace. The smell is a pleasant mixture of citrus, tropical fruit and pine. The taste is dominated by bitter grapefruit with some underlying hints of tropical fruit and pine. Full, creamy texture. Aggressively hopped and bitter."
"Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a tight, one inch, bright white head. Nose expresses delicate citrus notes, a hint of toasted malt and a light earthy quality. Taste expresses equal parts citrus, equal parts earthy/herbal with a kiss of toasted malt. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an easy, even carbonation, a light prickly and a mild acidity. Overall, my favorite of the three regular line-up, with Focal a close second."
I received the Alchemist’s the Crusher in the mail from a friend and I have to say it lives up to its reputation. It is a very delicious DIPA.
Wow. At one point I'd heard this was the worst of the 3 current Alchemist beers - and to me it may be the best of the 3. It pours a little lighter color than Heady topper (close gold-ness to Focal).
Serving: Can
"Hazy golden color with white head. Aroma is really dank and catty with onion, chives and garlic. Taste starts sweet and vegetal, really dank and herbal. Full bodied and smooth. Really good, lots of dank hops and a really good amount of bitterness."
appearance- Bright orange and hazy. Pours a soapy three to four inch head.
Poured into a Duvel tulip. No freshness date.
8/16 can drank in a tulip 8/17/2016
"While not quite as good as Heady, I'd put it up there pretty close. I'm honored to say that I got to try this for the first time on tap at the brewery - I highly recommend it!"
A: Poured a hazy yellow with good head and good lacing
Smell: there beers smell so awesome. Sweet oranges pineapple peaches banana melon super juicy hops.
"A little boosy especially the smell. Good carb, fading bitter typical of a good IPA. This one is very hoppy. Great beer if you like hops. Bit of citrus taste, more bittler than focal or Heady."
"Poured from the 16oz can just picked up from the brewery on August 4, consumed on Monday the 8th. Super fresh! Into a Foam Brewers snifter this beer is a very cloudy deep orange color with a fluffy head that leaves good lacing splotches."
ALCHEMIST CRUSHER DIPA 8/14/16
Big bodied. Almost like there's honey or something amping up the mouthfeel. Balanced flavor. Classic pine and grapefruit rind flavor. Fairly boozy. More traditional in style than their other beers.
Soo good and soo drinkable! I love these guys!!
"Appearance is that same bright, turbid yellow-orange that all the other Alchemist IPAs have, at least those I've tried. The Crusher is topped with a very large, foamy, slightly more dense, almost khaki head leaving shit tons of spongy lace."
Thanks to mymrnngjckt for the hookup on this. A pounder can poured into a tulip shaped pint appears hazy copper in color with a foamy off-white cap resting atop that fades leaving stringy lace.
Poured from a 16oz can into tulip glass:
"Undated can purchased 8/4 at Alchemist, but I'd guess it's not more than a day or two older than that. Poured into Kane tulip glass."
"Poured from a can into a tulip. Dank, sweet, nice mouthfeel, not a ton of citrus / tropical fruit and a bit more malty presence than I prefer but a nicely balanced beer similar to Heady."
"This beer pours a vibrant cloudy golden orange with a 2 finger foamy white head that sticks around forever and leaves webbed chunks of lacing. The smell is orange, grapefruit, citrus pith, dank pine and sweet malts. Taste is the same. A little too sweet and malty for my liking, but super hoppy nonetheless. Feel is excellent. Medium-full, oily and sticky with a prickly bitter finish. Very drinkable though. Overall a very good beer. 9%+ DIPAs are normally too malty for me and this is no exception. But at the same time it is definitely a hop wallop upside the head, just wish it was a touch less sweet."
Way too happy for me. Very bitter with only hints of fruits.
"A: Hazy, dark orange with a thick soapy white head."
"Juicy, hazy orange body with a thick, frothy off-white head. Aroma is very juicy; big citrus, mango and pineapple. Flavor is big and hoppy with tons of juicy notes; pineapple, bitter citrus zest, a hint of bitter grapefruit. Feel is full, juicy, slight alcohol note. A really nice DIPA. Slightly more alcohol presence than many of their other offerings, but still juicy and delicious."
"Got to try this one a few times. Reminds me of Green from Tree House. Still I prefer Heady Topper, little bitter to me but very good when you can get it fresh. Great smell, little bit of malt but noting too major."
"A. Medium copper color, slightly hazy, small egg shell head."
"16oz can from Jeremy, bottle share on 7/30/16. One of the evening’s highlights, where big juicy IPAs were in abundance. Citrus aroma, grapefruit, some pine resin. Citrus carries over to the taste with some caramel malts peeking through , minor bitter bite. Crushable indeed..."
"Overall I thought this was a great DIPA. Lots of grapefruit, citrus hops, and resin to it. While I prefer HT this is right on par with Focal Banger and a world class beer."
"Pours a thick dark opaque golden orange, with a robust and creamy head, and nice citrusy nose. Intensely Hop forward and back, with lots of hop oil retention and maltyness on the palate. Malty pineapple and orange flavors, and creamy rich mouth feel. This is my favorite of the Alchemist beers!"
This completely shocked me. It tastes like an imperial version of focal banger. This is possibly the best from alchemist. Super juicy and dangerously drinkable at 9%. Amazing!
"Smell is slightly dank, lychee, and orange citrus. Taste is orange, mango, juicy citrus, and a fairly bitter finish with a slightly boozy aftertaste. Very different from Heady and Focal Banger but just as high quality."
"pours out a slightly hazed golden orange with a bright white head, excellent lacing. aromas of danks, grain, lemon, herbs, pine. on palate is big earthy dankness, grapefruit peel, herbal and pine needles. mouthfeel is medium with some nice texture to it. overall a very enjoyable and smooth DIPA that is well balanced, cheers!"
16oz can poured into a tulip
Awesome beer and stoked I finally got to try this. The difference between this and Heady/Focal is huge but doesn't lessen the beer. Found it interesting they said it's more like a barleywine and you can age it 2 years in the fridge
"Straight from the brewery. Poured into a tulip, though I drank 1/4 of it from the can to compare. Prefer the glass."
"opaque, fruity smell, piney taste, dry"
"Big oily resinous hop aroma and taste. Nice mix of pine and citrus. Great balance between the sticky hops and the sweet malt, love the lingering bitterness. "
Mastering the art of making India pale ale only leads to hop-heads wanting more. And its that push of the envelope that causes the Alchemist brewer to go absolutely ballistic with the scarce cones. Using the most irresistible hops on the planet with the techniques that allow the beer to have a succulent upstart and a gripping dry finish gives The Crusher a taste that linger much longer in memory as it does on the palate.
"Hazy gold with orange hues with resinous clinging lacing, looks like a killer DIPA. Smell is of earthiness, pine, pineapple, grapefruit trace amounts of orange zest and bready malt sweetness. Taste is killer! Tons of hops perfectly blended with the malts this one could easily be too sweet or too hoppy but the balance here is pure symmetry. You get a ton of tropical fruits-grapefruit, pineapple and hints of mango throughout with a light bit of pineyness and dry malt sweetness in the tailend. Nice dry cloying finish leaves you begging for more. Overall, I had high expectations for this beer which and am usually let down but this beer lives up to the billing, A truly stellar example of the style and worth seeking out."
"This is a big beautiful DIPA, damn this is so good. Awesome hazy dark/murky orange with great foam retention. Smell is equally impressive, dank dank dank, huge hops... I'd be guessing galaxy/mosaic/simcoe??? you get a good whiff of alcohol but nothing that would turn you off. too much fruity goodness to sip on. Tastes great, lots of earthy hops coming through and it's a big boy, the way a DIPA should be! a slight bitter/dry finish but it's just right... this beer has been perfected. So much dandy-weed here, loving this... go seek this out!"
Slight hazy golden yellow. White head.
Can from the brewery.
"Pale hazy orange with a head that keeps and spattered lacing. Smell is super dank. Getting lots of wet fermented hop. Searching deeper, there's a nice tropical bouquet. First time I had this I thought it was a little too boozy. It's clearly a heavy IPA, but not in your face. Nice malt presence balanced by a fruit hopping. Thick mouthfeel, solid carb."
This beer is stunning! Everything about it is beautiful. Reminded me of ultra fresh Heady straight out of the tank. It's super dank citrus-y liquid hops candy. Ultra..um...crushable for a 9%.
"16oz can, undated but purchased fresh from the brewery's reopening, poured into an Anchorage Brewing Teku glass."
"On tap at the new Stowe brewery. This beer is a golden orange color with a frothy white head. Loads of pungent hops in the nose, resinous, dank, citric and well hidden is the dry, toasted, sweet malt backbone. Taste is a mouthful of delicious hop juice over a semi sweet malt base. It all works well together but I could see this one nailing me if I had more than 20 ounces or so."
"This beer is ridiculous. It's so well done like all of the other stuff from the Alchemist, but I will say the hop profile is a bit more punishing than their other offerings. It's delicious but not quite as balanced as Heady and Focal."
"fan-f'n- tastic offering. the hop aroma hits you as soon as you pop the top. pours a wonderful murky orange, notes of mango and pinapple on the nose. You must LOVE hop flavor to enjoy this brew, lots of tropical notes with a definite bitter hop backbone and a dry almost bitter finish. somehow the high booze level is so well hidden here, this can lives up to its name. Def a dangerous brew!! Another banger from the Alchemist! Cheers!"
L - pours an orange cream tangerine dream. Big fluffy head abounds. Lattice structure (let's pretend I know what I'm taking about) that takes its sweet time dissipating. 
"Very intense hoppyness, out of the three from our ""case"", love the new brewery!"
"Although it's stronger than HT and FB, it's a bit sweeter. So easy to drink."
"Much more bitter than other Alchemist offerings, but still refreshing and delicious, although strong as well."
Fresh can poured into flute. As well as previous taster at the new brewery in Stowe.
"today new brewery in Stowe, VT. "
"Poured from a can purchased at the new brewery in Stowe, VT. "
"Fresh can consumed in Lincoln, Nebraska."
Not quite Heady Topper but its still fantastic!
Great beer from a great brewery.
"Ugly silver can shared by MrBarleywine, thanks for the opportunity!"
"Got this from a trade, probably the only way I could get it here in Florida. This beer has a ton going for it and not much going against it."
Heady Killer for sure.
"Had from a can within 30 days of release with several people, everyone agreed this is worthy of 100pts."
Not very good.
My least favorite of the Alchmesit hoppy beers. The crusher is an accurate name as I felt this beer was overpowering in terms of hops and malt. Very bitter beer that was not as balanced as their other offerings
"Huge thanks to Joe_Grizzly for sending me a tanker full of Alchemist brews, I actually hopped up & down in excitement when the UPS truck stopped in front of the house today. Slightly dented 16 oz. silver bullet, going down. "
16oz can purchased on 10/4/14 at The Alchemist's truck sale. Poured into a snifter tasting glass. 
"All I can say is wow. I don't know how they get a juicy DIPA at 9.6%. It would have been my first 5 except for the head that fades quickly. I would imagine that is due to all the hop oils in this beer. It might be impossible to get a 5 here, but man this is close."
"Sample from the brewery, the name says it all. A very intense brew yet stay drinkable for a big beer. Not for the faint of palate though as the hopping is pretty bold if not slightly harsh, in a good way."
Take Heady and Focal and add a few more bushels of hops...
"A-Cloudy orange, two finger head with some lacing."
"Mango and pineapple nose. Lovely resiny hops with notes of citrus and tropical fruits. Balance and a lack of bitterness while offering huge, juicy flavor. For my money, this could be better than Heady."
Can into Alchemist stemless wine glass.
16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
"Got this thanks to a very generous fellow out of Vermont that's not on ba, but thanks matt!"
"Crusher, Poured a tulip glass."
"A - Copper orange color with medium hue, dense white lacing, lots of floaties, mild carbonation."
L: Hazy orange with a lingering foam head.
"16 oz. can gifted from GMRFx, unknown can date but purchased at the most recent Alchemist tent sale on 08/11/2014, poured into a small plastic glass at a BJCP study group, drank 08/27/2014 over an hour."
Fantastic brew. Heady Topper on steroids. Similar flavor profile and nose as HT but beefed up with more hop presence as well as malt backbone. Still very drinkable and an amazing finish.
"This is easily a top 5 beer for me personally, better than Heady for sure, this one is special, drive/fly for it if need be!"
Great beer! The Alchemist strikes again by coming out with a great DIPA that is similar yet different then Heady and Focal. I wish that this got to the west coast!
"Cloudy pour, wonderful citrus/grapefruit/pineapple smell, prefer this to heady."
This beer has fallen off from when it was first brewed several years ago. Still a really good DIPA and I would drink it any time
"Did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper."
The latest batch is even better than earlier versions. More citrus notes.
Sixteen ounce can shared by Dan (thanks) via the truck sale.
"Tried a 3 ounce sample at the 2014 vermont Brewers festival. Pours a hazy yellow/light orange hue with excellent carbonation and head retention. The aroma runs the gamut of tropical fruits with a Piney undertone, slight malt nose and just a hint of the high abv present. Tastes like a creamy mix of mango, papaya with several layers of hop flavor. The beer finishes incredibly smooth even though the mouthfeel is just so viscous and chewy. Another gem from Waterbury's (soon to be Stowe's) favorite brewer. This beer is worth seeking out."
16oz can from the recent truck release. Poured into a Lawson's Finest snifter 7/26/2014.
Tallboy can courtesy of Mike....what a great guy.
"Can shared by Curran, thanks dude."
Sampled at VT brew fest.
"Pours a totally hazy yellow-orange body with a fat ring of lacing on the glass. Mango and papaya in the aroma but the flavor is so raw and good. Lots of fruit, some bitter, some sweet. Melon, hint of grapefruit and papaya are strong. This is so different that Heady yet almost just as good, if not as good."
Tasted this at brewfest 2014. A nice beer that I wouldnt mind trying again as beerfest only gives you 4 oz glasses and the lines are VERY long at the Alchemist section. Even longer than the Lawsons section. A very hoppy beer and has areal nice alcoholic bite but not too powerful.
"The first time I had this beer it was hands down my favorite Alchemist beer to date. Since then I have had it maybe twice and it wasn't as good as I remembered it being. However, that being said the beer is still excellent. It's got tons of flavor and aroma. Overall this beer is still and always will be awesome."
Pours a perfectly opaque orange color with big hoppy herbal notes and a little tropical fruit on the nose. The taste is more tropical fruit balanced by an earthy hop explosion. The ABV is present but it's not as over the top boozy as some have said. Big rich incredibly chewy mouthfeel. This beer is intense and I love it!!
this stuff is awesome
Purchased at today's can sale. I have had The Crusher in the past at the old pub and the Vermont Brewer's Festival. I'm excited to re-visit it.
Taken out of a 38* fridge poured into pint glass.
16 oz can poured into The Alchemist Pint glass.
"A: Pours a golden color, very cloudy, with minimal head that dissipates to a light ring."
Served from a pounder into an Alchemist Will Becher. 
"Remarkably similar to Heady Topper. See my review of that for supplemental tasting notes. This is basically Heady Topper that appears a little brighter, with a dryer finish and a touch of alcohol heat. Phenomenal. So easy drinkable at 9.6%. If I was told I was drinking Heady, I probably would have believed it."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a HF Willi glass.
"Pour is hazed deep yellow amber with a tight white head. Nose grain up front with a ton of hop punch behind it. Citrus is strong with notes of pine and floral hops. Taste is different, lots of citrus and grapefruit with a good bit of herbal and piney hop. Light resin, the herbal/floral note has a light tang and peppery touch. Body is lighter, well carbonated and fairly dry finish."
"Thanks for the can, Joey!"
Review after my second Crusher. Was skeptical that it would live up to being as good or better than my favorite Heady but wasn't disappointed. I am at a 5 on both and it would be a tossup on which to buy cases of if they were both readily available. Simple answer is I'd buy a case of each.
Poured from the can into a snifter glass one day after release.
"Lucky enough to be in VT when this was released. Drank straight from the can, and then the next one into a Teku glass."
"Drank 1/2 from HF balloon glass, 1/2 from the can."
Not really understanding the hype behind this one. I think TG's Pompeii is actually a much better IPA. Here goes:
"Bomber from Tavour. Well worthy of its reputation. Hazy golden pour. Big airy, frothy head. Piney, hoppy aroma is followed by a luscious taste, creamy smooth and with a gentle bitterness. Heavenly throughout."
"Thinly hazed, lightly golden body; rocky, sticky, white head. Pine and spice aroma; a bit of tropical fruit juice. Intense combination of pine and hop bitterness flavors; a smidgen of orange and pineapple as well as some alcohol presence. Heavy body; rather sharp and prickly with the bitterness and ABV; semi-dry finish."
"Sosus Double IPA from Toppling Goliath reminded me a lot of Yellow Rose IPA (Texas) and both are really great IPAs. Both are juicy, dank and refreshing and a real delight to drink. For me it is easier to find Yellow Rose but I am glad I got my hands on a few Sosus. They are both truly outstanding IPA."
"Like Gene Tierney In “The Ghost and Mrs Muir,” this one has Raul spellbound. Delicious like a triscut after a sack of bubble kush, this one delivers. Imagine yourself on an island, and on this island J-Lo picks you the finest tropical fruits in all the land... This beer is that. You. J-Lo, and guavas and stuff... I just can’t, I cannot go on."
Pretty close to perfect.
"Appearance - From the bottle, the beer poureda hazy yellow color with a cracker white head. "
"On-tap at The Tip Tap Room, Boston, MA"
"I love the story behind this beer's name and art, and I do enjoy giving Mosaic single-hop DIPAs a shot, even though I have a storied history of finding them to be among the most inconsistent form of pale ale to ever grace my glass, so I felt like I needed to give this one a good shot. Toppling Goliath has generally impressed me with their hoppier beers, which I'm very glad to find in my area after years of only hearing about them! Here goes nothing!"
Poured from 22oz bottle into glass. Bottling date is stamped '08/14/18'.
Poured from 22 oz bottle into shaker pint glass. Picked this up at the brewery a couple days ago.
Toppling Goliath has had an incredible summer IMO. Really did Mosaic justice on this one.
"22oz bottle undated purchased at Moonshine. Hazy orange color and citrusy nose. Citrus flavors such as orange, pineapple and mango come through with a background of grapefruit especially on the finish. An enjoyable beer."
"Hazy, golden-orange. Nicely carbonated. Mosaic normally isn’t one of my favorite hops, but this is terrific! TG makes so many outstanding IPAs and DIPAs and this yet another."
Always one of my favorites from Toppling. I had to go back and move up my past rating on this with this latest batch. I love the grapefruit rind flavors I’m getting. It’s crisp and a nice change from the super sweet milkshake IPAs that are everywhere now.
"This is an awesome double india pale ale with a hazy appearance (especially if you add the yeast at the bottom of the bottle), and an aroma that is fruity and dank beyond what words can possibly describe. The taste is intensely bitter but fairly balanced and the aftertaste features a fairly mild but long bitterness and dankness."
Growler poured into snifter glass.
Bomber poured into teku glass
Pours a beautifully hazed bright orange with a plump finger of off-white foam.
"Hazy, orange beer with a big fluffy head that leaves tons of lacing behind. Smells sweet and tropical with overripe papaya, notes of orange and some floral hops. Tastes lightly sweet with the papaya and orange up front. The sweet and citrus is washed away with a nice bitterness with some pithy and some floral qualities. This is a nice beer showcasing mosaic hops."
Bottled ~5 weeks ago. 
Appearance – Two and a half finger head on a hazy yellow body.
"Pours to a semi-hazy, straw appearance with a 1 finger white head that breaks rather quickly. Smells like Mosaic - really a fantastic nose of dank earth, grass and herbs with creamy citrus in the background. Taste is great too with plenty of dank hoppy goodness - pine, earth, citrus, etc. Feel is moderate - perfect for the style. Like almost all TG hoppy brews, this is a clean tasting DIPA that is well made and an absolute pleasure to drink."
"I opened a bomber from the most recent release. The color is golden straw with a white haze.1 finger head and nice lacing. Nose is of cream, blueberry and sweet onion. Taste is amazing. It incorporates all the good sides of mosaic and adds the complexity of white tea with a touch of lime on the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect. Not pillowy but fine, impactful effervescence. This batch is amazing. It is my second bomber. I don't think one can do better with mosaic."
"I received this in a BIF box from @swenny916. Poured from 22 oz. bottle (no evident bottling date) into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, almost opaque, golden-honey color with a huge, fluffy, milk-white head and lacing that resembles gelato. Huge smell of Mosaic hops with lemon, grapefruit, and lots of pine needles. This is a classic bitter, hoppy, DIPA smell. Wow, just superb! It opens with a blast of Mosaic (one of my favorite hops) that bites from the start. There follows a dose of tart grapefruit and lemon, along with bitter pine. Then, at the finish, there just a hint of tropical fruit and vanilla/caramel that takes the edge off the bitterness. Until, that is, the after taste, which is a Mosaic-lover's delight. It's off the IBU scale. This ale is crisp, dry, with lively carbonation, and at 8% ABV it's dangerously drinkable. Overall, Sosus is one of the best single hopped DIPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. In a world of gimmicky, adjunct-laden IPA's, it's nearly perfect. It absolutely deserves its World Class rating!"
Consumed 4/7/18
"Drank from a 22 fl oz (1 pint 6 fl oz) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
A fresh pour straight from the tap at Toppling Goliath in a pint glass. 
22oz Bomber
"Big fluffy head like a feather bed. Sits on top of a dark golden body. Not clear. Not pulpy. Murky. Melon, grass, and guava on the nose. Once you taste, it turns it up. Slick mouthfeel gives this dipa an ipa feel. Juicy and heavy without being cloying. Helluva beer"
"Recent batch. Poured into a TG tulip. Slightly hazy golden yellow on color. White head develops that dissipates slowly. Aroma is passion fruit, some dankness and resin. Taste is everything that’s in th aroma. Super mosaic bomb. Dank and sticky. Feel is lighter for a DIPA. Overall, this is outstanding. One of the better mosaic hopped beers I’ve had."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big white fluffy head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells dank, with blueberry, floral, earthy, and apricots. It tastes dank, with subdued bitterness, blueberry, apricot, and earthy pine. The beer is medium full. This is a great IPA from Toppling Goliath."
"22 oz bottle purchased at Binny’s. A bit hazy on the look. Wow on the aroma, pineapple, fresh tropical candied fruit. Taste is similar, citrus forward. This beer is very good and near perfect. Glad I tried, but will not likely get it again due to the cost, $12. I can’t pay $6 for an IPA, when there are many almost as good for close to half the price."
July 2015 @ Savannah
22oz bottle
All Mosaic... nose is tropical while the taste has some nice bubblegum notes that I usually only get from the regular Tree House IPAs. Solid all over.
"Super duper fresh. Maybe 2-3 days old. Picked up with KBBS Feb '17. Best Mosaic beer I've ever had, and I've had some amazing ones. This batch, this fresh.....takes the cake"
"Cant' tell the bottling date as it's smudged, so hopefully nothing off about it. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a moderate white foam head that quickly recedes, leaving a small amount of lacing on the side."
"Sosus pours as you would hope it would. Bright but deep gold with a fresh, unfiltered look. Not hazy... floaty. The good floatie. Not a ton of crap in there. A rocky white head holds tight to the surface and sides of the glass."
"Delicious beer. Can really taste the Mosaic Hops. A slow drinker. Full mouthful feel. It's about #4 for me on the TG bombers. It's a incredibly well crafted beer. If you are a Mosaic fan, it's a must try."
"Nice frothy two finger high head with a dimpled surface of an eggshell white hue, retention is above average as any larger bubbles settle into the mass, the lacing is extremely thick and looks glued to the glass sides, almost no movement. Shiny yellow gold to orange rust colored liquid, no real visible haze, coated wall-to-wall in a sheet of fast rising bubbles. Pretzel dough, salt and freshly mown grass infuse the nose first, sour white grapefruit accents frame the pineapple, papaya, nectarine fruit scents, on the whole has a dry texture which stymies its lift, pine cone, decomposing forest floor matter provide dankness before it all cascades away. Full-bodied, on the heavy side and super creamy, enough so that it counterbalances the biting hoppiness. The carbonation diffuses the flavors some. More concentration and sweetness here in the pineapple, mango, peach fruit, buttressed by the buttered biscuit element. Much more zesty bite in the orange to white grapefruit citrus than juice. Loses a good bit of the dankness here, cleaner grassiness. Has a tight weave to it which might benefit from relaxing and letting it all flow more."
Poured from a bomber into a 8 oz glass. Glory from smell to taste resiunds from this beauty of a beer. Sof pillow of a head that was light and frothy to the crisp mouthfeel. Glorious beer!!
"Hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma has dank, grassy hops with sweet orange rind and pink grapefruit. Taste follows hoppy and dank with sweet malt in the background, really well balanced. Grassy with a medium grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Medium body and carbonation, feels smooth on the palate. A really well made DIPA, balanced, with the 8% ABV integrated very well."
22oz. bomber bottle poured into Willi Becher.
So many top 250 beers I don't agree with but this one is well deserving.
On tap at Toppling Goliath 8/16/17.
"Tasted from bottle. Pours a hazy gold with thick rocky white head. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruit notes. Taste pretty bitter with flavors of orange, grapefruit, resin, pine, caramel, mango, papaya. Very well done excellent tasting imperial IPA."
"After all the hop bomb cloudy IPAs that are so popular these days, it's nice to have a straight up old style double IPA that delivers the goods. Pours a semi-cloudy orange hued gold color with strong head and thick creamy lacing. Smell is a dank and citrusy hop, but not overpowering in the slightest. Taste is slightly bitter and slightly citrusy, but extremely well balanced and flavorful. Very smooth drinking, easily sippable, an extremely good beer."
"Loads of mango,dryness in the nose and taste. Some sulphur presence, dryness and pomelo as this warms. Finishes dry citrus and tropical "
"Poured out a hazy, copper color with a one-finger head of foam. It smelled so tropical - mango, pineapple, grapefruit. Sweet and juicy tasting with tropical notes and sweet caramel. Nice bitterness for balance."
"L - Cloudy goldenrod with rocky white head that took some coercing to generate. The remaining layer is replenished with a steady flow of dispersed streams of carbonation, creamy enough to coat rather than lace"
"Bottled dated 7/10/17. Consumed 7/25/17. Strong citrus and pine aroma... very strong! Golden haze color, with a small off-white head, dropping quickly to a bubbly cap and ring. Taste is true to the aroma with citrus and pine flavors, but not much bittering at all (despite the pine flavor). Good body to the feel, smooth. Excellent flavor, with just enough bittering in the finish. Excellent."
"L- Pours a brilliant, hazy orange with a huge, white head and lots of carbonation."
"Bomber dated 7/14/17, About 2 weeks on it."
Pours a rich orange color with 1 finger of head and great lacing.
"Sosus is here to bring us all the glory that is the Mosaic hop. I had this a couple years ago at the taproom and now have a chance to review a bottle. Nothing terribly remarkable about the appearance. Slightly hazy amber with a dense head. Moderate amount of lacing is left down the glass. Very pungent aroma as soon as the crown is off the bottle. This is one dank, weedy smelling beer. Also more subtle notes of tropical fruit and a herbal component. This is one wonderful tasting beer. You can have all the King Sue, just give me Sosus. This is dank, herbal, and tropical. Maybe not in perfect harmony as it gets a little bit much with the dank. But new flavors are discovered with every sip. Nice malt sweetness as the brewers put consider thought into this hoppy beer. Excellent body and carbonation for a double IPA. I would say this is the finest example of a Mosaic DIPA in the world."
"Golden with Orange tint and a thick white head that sticks around a couple minutes. A citrus resin and biscuit nose. Tastes of orange peel and pine and a nice malt backbone. The soft malt pairs great with the Mosaic hops on the palate to leave that great dry, resiny after taste. Great beer."
Happy Father's Day to me.
"Pours hazy orangeish yellow. Thick, medium, off white head that lasts a while with lacing."
"Chewy, Dank, Fresh, Citrus. Lucky to try this beer!"
"Pours a nice deep honey color. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit, papaya, mango, and more citrus. Flavor is delicious. Lots tropical fruit with a distinct mosaic hop presence. While mosaic is not my favorite hop this is reall week done. Feel is nice but not as big as I would associate with a DIPA. Overall this is delicious."
Poured into a snifter.
"First Toppling Goliath beer. Only took 2800 beers. Oh, man. "
Smell: tropical fruits pineapple peach and guava. You get that blueberry and dankness that mosaic is know for. This smells like a mosaic hoped beer.
This is my favorite tg beer. (That I've had)
22oz bottle poured into a TG tulip
nice orange yellow hazy
"Very zesty and bitter DIPA. I get more fruit the more I drink. Really dank. Nice malt backbone. Semi-dry, but still leaves some residual sugars to balance out the bitterness."
Pours a light golden color. Initially cloudy but it clears up as the beer settles in the glass. Thick frothy head dissipates steadily leaving lots of white lacing on the glass. Lovely looking beer. 
"This is a solid DIPA, probably due in part to my affinity for mosaic hops. Don't let my bias persuade you from trying, however. This is a world class beer, make no mistake about it. Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass."
Happy to check the box on this one.
2-21
Three bottles enjoyed between early January 2017 and late February 2017.
"Poured a slightly cloudy golden orange color with just over fingers worth of foamy white head. The smell is amazing, full of sweet fruit and pine resin. Very juicy fruit flavor with a good balance of pine bitterness. The feel is medium with decent carbonation and a bit of smoothness. This beer is amazing. Perfect use of the Mosaic hop. Been waiting a long time to try this one and it's worth the wait."
Moderately clear amber-gold with a minimal bubbly off-kilter head that recedes to a collar.
"I have come to the conclusion that Mosaic hops are really my favourite. Yes, even above rock-star status Galaxy and Citra. This is the hops that brings the dank, the resin, the pithy citrus and grapefruit. This is what I've always loved about hops, and this is one of the best representations of such hops I can remember. One of my top DIPA's ever."
"Smells amazing. Giant mosaic nose. Very smooth and light for a DIPA, but ABV catches up. Looks unassuming, but packs a juicy punch."
"Tasted in a snifter from a 22 oz bottle on January 24, 2017."
Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange color with a two finger dense off-white head.
"Great beer! From the minute I cracked this open I could smell it. Right off the bat I get a citrusy smell along with pineapple and maybe some mango. What ever it is, it smells amazing. Taste wise the mouth follows the smell, the moasic hops for me came through for me and gave a perfect balance. There's an great bitterness/sweetness balance here that far surpasses anything else by TG. I got hit with the bitter right up front, but then as it wheres on you the sweetness comes on at the end for a great after taste. The overall mouth feel for this is really quite smooth and the perfect amount of carbonation. Given its high IBU there's a somewhat dry finish but it's not over powering and the longer I sit between sips the more sweetness that returns. "
L- Light orange color. More clear than I would expect. Solid fluffy white head with lots of lacing. 
L (4) - More of clear orangey color than I expected. And a coarser bright white bubble presence.
Sosus
I loved Pompeii IPA so I had to try this as it is pretty much the DIPA form of Pompeii. The scent blew me away. Scent was fresh cirtus fruits and very intense! Taste followed with citrus followed by dank hops. Super juicy. Tasted like I was eating fresh fruit.
Great beer. Clear golden brew with nice lacing. The smell is full of citrus fruit. The mosaic hop is amazing. Incredibly easy to drink with not much bitterness. Thanks to @ECOBOOSTINST for the trade. This is one of my top ipas.
"Smells INCREDIBLE. So dang juicy, hazy, just gorgeous. Was sitting on the couch with the beer on the side table and i kept smelling it from where i was sitting. So good. First sips of juicy bitter dank hop. Huge power dank on the tongue. This may be better than the king. I know they are different hop profiles but as a dipa this is crazy good. one of the best ive had id say. Had in from a bomber, poured into a 'Pulpit Rock tulip'. NICE"
"Poured from 22-ounce bomber into an oversize wine glass. Slightly hazy, deep orange-amber color with a fluffy snow-white head that seems to hang on forever. Luscious aromas of grapefruit, citrus, and pine, with some light floral notes. Not quite as intense on the palate, where the hop intensity is somewhat subdued. Flavors of tangerine and grapefruit, notes of pine resin and citrus rind. Not nearly as bitter as I expected for the high IBU rating. Well balanced, crisp finish without much lingering bitterness on the palate. Alcohol presence is nearly undetectable. Excellent complement to spicy food. Another outstanding hoppy offering from Toppling Goliath."
"Appearance: slightly hazy yellow, big head."
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an IPA glass. 
My neighbor once again kicks ass and let's me in on a fantastic beer. It poured a slightly hazy yellow with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is awesome....juicy fruit zeal. The taste is nicely balanced and leans slightly bitter. There is a definite fruit base with bitterness toward the end....thinking mosaic hops. The Mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's amazing and certainly worth a try.
I must post a disclaimer. I tend to not love Mosaic heavy beers.
"Pour at the TG tasting room. First off, this is imo the best mosaic ipa I have ever had. Its perfectly balanced in every way, smooth and juicy while have a nice hop bitterness that doesn't linger. Could drink all day...."
Poured from a 22 oz bottle with no date into a tulip glass. 
"L: clear golden, with huge white sea foam head"
Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a JK Snorkel glass. Unable to find a date on the bottle.
Pours with a thick head over a deep golden base. 
"this is pretty special stuff, and definitely one i have been seeking out for awhile. all mosaic, these guys do some special stuff with citra, nice to see this at an equally high level, some of the best single hop beers in the world i have to imagine, not in any way wanting for a more complete hop profile, i dont know how these guys do it while so many others fail. this is hazy yet bright sunny yellow, not all that different than say king sue looked in the glass, not quite a full inch of white head. aroma of pineapple juice and orange, really lively and juicy, ripe and strong, minimally bitter, without any of the cat pee aroma we often get in lower quality mosaic beers. the flavor matches pretty well, canned pineapple juice for sure, more bitterness here, lime zest, orange juice, even a hint of oily mango sweetness here, lots of hop compounds swirling around in here. i like the grain base too, its perfectly round and smooth and substantial enough to support all these fruity mosaic hops, but not too big or sweet to get in the way. really well built overall. everyone and their brother is using mosaic and citra right now, the cat is well out of the bag on these varietals, but very very few use them as well as toppling goliath. this rarity is well worth the hype, just delicious on tap!"
"Great overall beer. A ton of peach on the nose and a melon flavor. If I had this and King Sue side by side, it would be hard to tell the difference. TG never fails to disappoint"
"Pours a Beautiful hazy golden color with tons of lacing on the side of glass as you drink this, smell was tropical with white fruit, tropical and citrus. Taste is delicious a great blend of fruity hops with papaya , peach, pear,mango, and citrus, medium carbonation with little bitterness , its highly drinkable and tasty"
"Nose - tropical fruit aplenty....mango, guava and some stone fruit like peach and apricot"
Serving: Bomber into pint
"Had this side by side with Pompeii. The Sosus was 2 MONTHS fresher than the Pompeii, but Pompeii was much much better in my opinion. It was more fruit forward where Sosus was 3x as bitter."
Bottles just sitting on the shelf at Hy-Vee.
"A: Hazy orange-gold color, though almost translucent. Two-inch white foam head with tons of beautiful lacing."
"One of the better mosaic DIPAs I've had. Pours a clear burnt orange with decent head and moderate lacing. Tons of danky pine, ripe pineapple, and blueberry in both taste and smell. Toppling Goliath continues to impress...."
"pours a clear orange with one finger head. Aroma is onion, basil, pineapple, mango, orange. Taste is orange sherbet, pineapple, and bitter mosaic hops. Mouth feel is full and creamy. Carbonation is crisp. One of the better IPAs I've had this year."
Excellent
Tropical juice bomb with piney bittterness lingering. Pineapple shines through the palate. Second favorite TG hoppy offering (King Sue is my #1). Definitely worth seeking out.
Served in a La Chouffe tulip
"Lots of tropical fruit, great nose, one of my favorite mosaic beers ever. TG can really do hoppy beers; now if only they'd get a little wider distribution footprint, they'd be perfect!"
"Smell is passionfruit, sweet malt, pine, pineapple, and dankness. Taste is dank, pine resin, mango, and citrus. Nice mixture of a west coast IPA with a more tropical-forward IPA. Zeelander is still my favorite TG IPA, but this might be a close second."
"Bottle dated 5/02/2016 poured into a Toppling Goliath ""chalice"" (their words, though it's a tulip) on 5/15/2016"
Such a treat. Easily the best mosaic beer I've ever had. Juicy berry and tropical fruits with a slight dankness. Tg does it again.
Pours golden honey color with large fluffy head.
Very good beer from TG. Typical cloud appearance like you'd see with PseudoSue or Pompeii. Aftertaste is weed. Surprisingly smooth for an 8.00%-er. Would definitely seek this one out if it comes our way again.
"L - turbid orange, medium white head"
"Newer labeled 22oz bottle poured into a snifter. The beer pours a golden straw color with a little bit of haziness. There is a decent amount of carbonation in the beer resulting in a decent amount of dense white foam. The aromas have peach, citrus, and grapefruit. The taste is slightly bitter, hop forward, crisp, intense pine notes, and follows the citrusy aromas. Medium body with the aforementioned carbonation. Definitely a hop showcase here. Overall this is a very delicious DIPA and worth seeking out. You will not be let down, cheers!"
"Pours an orange-amber color with a smaller, bubbly head on top."
"Exceptional DIPA. Nice orange appearance. Juicy, tropical fruit smell. Not much bitterness or overly sweet tasting. More tropical fruit tasting and goes down very smoothly.... Almost too smoothly. Would love to be able to find this easier."
"This is one of the best IPAs on the market. Brilliant mosaic hop smell right away, followed by one of the best tastes that you will ever take from an IPA. Toppling Goliath knows how to make them, and this is as good as it gets."
L: pours a dark orange with a white head that lasts a while
"Drinking from a TH Teku glass. Got in trade about 2 weeks ago. Holding up nicely. Burnt orange look, great lacing, head sticks around. This is a mosaic single hop and it has a nice unique smell and taste as a result. Excellent stuff."
Bottle poured into a snifter.
"L: Glowing orange, the hue of Ryan Seacrest's fake tan. Unique, beautiful. "
"Wow. Tons of fruit on the nose and taste. mango, passion fruit, melon, candied citrus peel. Explosive fruitiness of a West coast ipa yet has the balanced, nuanced quality of a new England ipa. Seriously delicious beer."
Damn I was impressed by this beer.
L: Very light and transparent
"L - Dark, hazy, rusty orange with a finger of white, frothy head. Some sediment is sitting at the bottom of my glass too."
"As a Tree House regular, rarely do I find a beer that is at the same level. Most simply lack the tropical notes I now associate with IPAs. This beer didn't disappoint. No further explanation needed. Get this beer."
"This beer is definitely ""all that and a bag of chips."""
Poured from bomber bottled 9/20.
Bomber served into a tulip glass. Date on the bottle seems to be from August '15.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick fluffy head fades slowly leaving tons of lace. Just wanna keep sniffing the big juicy aroma, tropical fruit, pineapple. Flavor is soooooo juicy, and just as dank. Excellent combination of sweet and bitter. The hops turn floral/earthy in the swallow and linger just right. Full soft creamy mouthfeel. Been drinking some great IPAs lately, and this one is at the top of the pile."
Great beer from Toppling Goliath . I got the new bottle with the birds and I love it . This is a great DIPA thats stands up to the new england brews I get .
From 7/11/15. Poured into a snifter from a 12 oz. bottle.
Very unimpressed with this. Chunky with tons of sediment. Smelled and tasted like rotting onion. Really not an enjoyable experience. Reminded me a lot of 2-3 year old Founders Devil Dancer. Not worth the hype.
"This IPA from the midwest is right up there with the big dogs from New England. This was the closest to a ""Trillium"" type beer that I've had from a brewery in the midwest. The look, the smell, the taste, its all there. Great job TG, I look forward to the next batch!"
"Poured into a tulip glass. A nice orange color almost looks like a glass of orange juice. The head was a bit thin but had a nice white color to it., lacing was beautiful and plentiful. "
"The beer looks like pink grapefruit juice, straight gushing."
"A great example of highlighting the mosaic hop. Maybe a bit heavy on the malt for my preference and drinks a tad heavy for the style, but very pleased with this one."
Purchased at Toppling Goliath on Mornin' Delight release day!
"could tell from the look it was going to be good---cloudy! have yet to find and IPA or IIPA I liked that was clear--- great expression of mosaic-- Tropical fruits and hoppy dankness... a touch too malty for me but that's because my benchmarks are TreeHouse and Hill Farmstead and yes, I do believe they make the best hoppy beers on the planet..., But really well done.... TG!"
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight tulip glass. Thank you very much Paul for hooking me up with this awesome extra.
"Very nice beer, lots of fruit. Mouthfeel is amazing very smooth almost creamy like. One of the better double ipas I've had. No bitterness at all taste is all fruit"
A - orange amber clear color with nice white head that fades pretty quickly 
"Not a huge fan of Mosaic hops, but this is really damn good! Beautiful golden orange color. Smells dank, tropical fruit, orange juice. Taste is pithy citrus rind, orange juice, grapefruit, bitter rind and hints of pineapple and guava. Awesome beer with a lingering finish. Sticky, medium-bodied beer."
got some bottles at the 2015 MD release and poured at home
Had this after king sue on draft at TG and it blew the king away. This latest batch is the bomb
Fruit (especially orange) forward IPA. Incredibly smooth for a IIPA. Another amazing beer by @TGBrews.
Just picked up this newest bottling at TG on 29 Aug 15 while there for the MD release. New blue label and in my opinion a much better beer than the last version. Absolutely delicious!!
"Very malt forward, little to no aroma and barely tasted hop presence. Might be an old bottle, but without bottle dating I am not sure. Underwhelming."
Big thanks to tbadiuk for the bottle!

"Look: Very attractive. Rich orange body. Like King Sue, the body is darker orange, opaque. When held up to the sun, there is no shine through. The white head is patchy and clingy. After a bit, the head retreats into a scruffy halo around the glass, with a patchy island near the middle."
"Grapefruit, medium bitterness, orange, mosaic hops, lemon, light mango, clean malt, guava, passion fruit"
"A bit of a letdown here. It was a very good beer, but not even a top 5 DIPA for me."
wow great ipa. mice citric hop. straight up nice
"Did not live up to hype. I love mosaic and this didn't give me much of it. Generally a disappointment...and was high on my ""wants"" list."
"Mosaic isn't for me, but for the style it's well executed."
Pours an apricot orange with moderate clarity and a finger of head that disappeared into a wisp after a few sips. Nose is dominated by sweet resinous flavors with slight floral backing. Taste is more balanced than the nose with orangey citrus smoothing out the hop flavors. Beautifully balanced with a lingering hoppy finish.
Re-review. Had out of a bomber that was purchased during the MD release. 
Appearance: Pours a honey color with an orange tint; a decent amount of lacing is produced by the one inch cap
Delicious DIPA. I feel like last years batch was far better then this one though. Still very good and worth getting.
"Another great beer from TG. The Mosaic hops deliver a great juicy flavor, almost a touch of spice. Great citrus aroma. I think I like this more than Pseudo Sue. I can't wait until they brew this again."
Bottled dated 8-20-15. 
"Poured cold into tulip glass. No bottling date, but I know it was bottled around three weeks ago. Consumed on 9/12/14."
"On tap at Hunahpu’s Day 2014, poured into souvenir taster glass on the second run through the TG line after catching the last bit of King Sue. Cloudy light orange body with an off-white head that looks creamy. Aroma is citrus, mango, pine, caramel malt. Taste is mild citrus sweetness complimented by the caramel, moderate citrus peel and pine bitterness. Medium body, oily, creamy, and slick texture, average carbonation, long bitter finish."
Not a fan of mosaic hopps usually. But this is done so well I was surprised. Absolutely loved every last ounce. Well balanced. Thanks again TG!
Sosus is my 2nd Favorite (non stout) offering from TG...second only to King Sue. Sosus is an outstanding TG beer with awesome smooth hops character!
"Another awesome beer from TG. This beer is extremely drinkable. The mouth feel is great and I would recommend this beer to any IPA lover. This brew has a fantastic finish, which really stands out. "
"A: Hazy light orange color, creamy head, but doesn't really linger"
"Bomber shared by Doopie a few weeks back, and originally brought to us by youbrewidrink. Cheers for the share guys! Did this one and King Sue together."
Last batch of Sosus was very disappointing. Very malty and too much grapefruit.
A huge thanks to Jeff for this one. 750ml bottle into a Blue Point snifter. 
"Looks like hazy pineapple juice. Has that citrus Toppling Goliath smell. Sweet aroma. Mmm, that’s good stuff. Sweet and citrus smell. Awesome pineapple mango taste. So tasty. Can they make an average beer?"
A: deep golden ale with rich foamy head a few fingers high
Amazing DIPA. I've never had anything in the DIPA category that I'd put up with Heady...until now. I wonder if I drank them blind which one I'd choose...doesn't really matter because both are fantastic.
"Pours a mildy cloudy orange with sticky lacing. Nose has huge tropical fruit and pine character. Notes of peach, papaya,mango, and pine cones come through on the nose. Flavor has nice fruity hop flavor up front followed by bitter pine backbone. The bitterness is much more assertive than king sue. It's a clean bitterness that finishes with a nice pine character. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and well carbonated. Overall, another delicious dipa from Toppling Goliath."
22oz bottle from the release a couple of weeks ago. Poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.
"Thank, Chin!"
Bottle from the brewery shared by RussianDragon. Thanks bro!
Bottled about 10 days ago. Tulip glass. 
"It doesn't get better than this. Zero booziness, and absolutely heavenly to drink. If IPAs/DIPAs are your thing, you haven't had one until you've had this. Nearly perfect."
Sweet Tangerine juice. Really well balanced. No notes of booze. Huge citrus juice nose. Almost like Five Alive. Orange hazy body.
Appearance: A gorgeous straw bail color with a finger of white head and nice lacing.
"Oh man, I forgot how good this is. Poured this freshly bottled gem (. 8/21/14) was lead to believe this was said to be bottled on 8/20, pretty sure that is a fact."
"I had this a long time ago and rated it a perfect 5... It was at a small tasting and at the end of a long -mostly big/high abv- stout night. But I absolutely loved it and cried when it was gone.... This makes me nervous to revisit because I hope my first impression was accurate, here we go:"
"I hate to go with the perfect 5 but this one deserves it... Amazingly hoppy and fruity, melon, citrus, super ""dank"" if-you-will. Reminds me so much of Maine Beer Co. ""Dinner"". Light copper color, fruit bouquet aroma, what i want beer to taste like, bubbly and crisp, perfect. not much more to say..."
This is definitely one of the best double IPAs I've ever had. I've never had Heady but I have to imagine this can compete. 
1798th Review on BA
Possibly my bottle isn't as fresh as the person I got it from believed it was. I was expecting a bit more from this one. 
"22oz bottle into tulip. Thanks again, Geoffrey!"
This is an Double IPA brewed entirely with Mosaic hops. I'll admit I haven't actually been a big fan of this hop in the past and this one was the test to end all tests for if that held true.
"From 05/21/14 notes. Big thanks to BeerLawyer85 for sharing this one; thanks Ross! First Toppling Goliath beer, poured into a globe glass."
"Pours a light orange with a two-finger head which dissipates quickly. Decent lacing. The aroma is citrus, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. What an awesome display of the mosaic hop! Lots of fruit in the palate - citrus, passion fruit, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. Grapefruit,mpine resin, and malt in the finish. Medium bodied with decent carbonation and oily hop residue left on the tongue. Overall, potentially the finest double IPA I've ever had, outstanding work Toppling Goliath!"
Thanks to Wowcoolman for sharing this one at AndrewK's tasting. 
"Bottle shared at Swamp Head Bottle Drop. Psyched for this one. Pours light golden color with a thick white fluffy head on top. Aroma of vegetal hops (mmmm), grass, pine, (and maybe even a little weed mixed in). Flavor follows with a beautiful floral and vegetal hop note, some incredibly light sweet malts in the backdrop for a DIPA, grass, pine, ever so slight citrus rind but this focuses more on the grassiness. Medium bodied with medium carbonation and very easy drinking. Excellent brew, but probably overshadowed by Duet which I had right before it."
Pours out a nice orange in color with a great two-finger white head with great retention and some very nice lacing.
"650ml bottle, poured into a Toppling Goliath Teku. Enjoyed on 3/30/14, reviewed from tasting journal."
A-EBF sample pour. Foggy yellowish orange color with a tight packing of white froth.
Glass Used: Teku
"Grapefruit, orange, melon, tangerine, peach and pine. Cracker malt. Perfect level of sweetness to bitterness ratio. Dank and delicious. Citrus all day. Real good"
A: Pours a light golden color with about a half finger white head that dissipated quickly to light lacing.
Served chilled in a pint glass. 
"It pours golden with a thick white head. The nose is fresh, big passion fruit, floral, grassy, herbal, soft fruit, marmalade apricot, peach, and plum. The taste is soft, bitter-sweet, doughy, grapefruit, floral, light alcohol, herbal, bitter grass and toast with a dry, bitter finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation and velvety mouth-feel. Not quite as punchy as I hoped for. Smooth, crisp and rather drinkable. Pretty delicate for a double."
"Pour is golden yellow with a small amount of tight white head. Huge citrus, mango, and grapefruit with a hint of pine resin in back. A faint touch of sweet malt up front. Taste is more grapefruit with a hint of bitterness. Malts are so faint, hops are huge. Resin and grapefruit through the finish. Body is light, very well carbonated and quite dry."
This beer rocks! It's cloudy orange to yellow body is full of hoppy details & packed with citrus! There's a great sweet note from the malts & it's feels so good in your mouth you almost want to chug it! This is a perfect beer in my opinion & you need to get your hands on it if you can. Delicious!
"A huge year to say the least for the folks brewing in Decorah. Bottling line finally up and going and releases of Kentucky Brunch, Mornin' Delight, XHops, and Sosus have them one of the most talked about breweries in the country. Early in '13, Sue and Sosus were released simultaneously and people went crazy for it, and still do. This Imperial IPA focuses on the mosaic hop bringing out citrus and tropical fruit notes along with some dankness that make this an easy pick for the Hot 25 in Eastern Iowa!"
22oz bomber bottle with an awesome label that resembles a stained glass window. This stained glass depicts a frosty pint of beer with the name of the beer and the style of beer in the glass of beer. Above the pint is the Topping Goliath medical cross symbol. Flanking both sides of the stained glass is the Govt. Warning and a paragraph that describes the beer. A brewed date or a bottled date would have been extremely nice. 
"Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. The beer pours out a pale orange-gold color, slightly hazy, with a really tight 3 fingers of white head that sticks around like grim death. Really great nose on this beer! Lost of sweet and tart tropical fruit notes like pineapples, ripe peaches, lemons, sour apple jolly ranchers, and oranges."
Served in a snifter.
"A-clear golden color with a nice white head, and good lacing"
"22 oz. bottle kindly provided by Mista, thanks Geoffrey!"
"A - Pours a medium gold color with a light, creamy white foam head with a very soapy looking lacing ring, and sticky."
This poured out as a yellow color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is loaded with hops. The taste is also loaded with hops. The feel is medium bodied with a good carbonation to it. Overall it's a very good brew.
Huge thank you to Steasy66 for this treat.
10/12/2013 At work on a weekend
"Latest batch, opened 10/11/13"
"About a week after bottling, into my TG tulip."
Thanks to Stevedore for helping me get a bottle of this limited bottle of TG hops! Thanks again Steve!
I have pretty good faith when I buy a beer from this Iowa brewery. I bought a 22 oz. and saw everyone was buying their max 2 bottle alotment. I bought 1. It was still chilled so i brought it right home and opened it.
Beer pours pours somewhere in between straw and amber with a little haze. Pretty darn pretty. 
"A - Pours a bright straw yellow with a hint of golden orange. Nice finger+ of fluffy white head, pretty decent retention, absolutely fantastic lacing."
650 mL bottle poured into a snifter. 
"22 oz bottle sans bottle date, courtesy of JP and shared with Duane. Thanks buddy!"
Big thanks go out to bencopper27 for the 22 oz. bomber. My first from TG. Poured into my Bruery tulip.
"Wow. I generally drink Hill Farmstead and Heady. I've had all of the so-called great IPA's through various trades- Zombie Dust, Pliny, Three Floyds, everything from San Diego, etc. ..(snore). This is the real deal. Maybe I'm getting ahead of my self since I only had one bomber, but this has the super juicy, resiny, oily feel that all of the big boys are trying to get but few do."
Big thanks to mikeyv35 for sharing a couple bottles of this delicious beer. From notes
Date: 05/21/2013
"a clean light golden yellow pour with 2 fingers of bright white head which gave off a ton of great sticky lacing. smells mostly of bitter hops, pine, grapefruit.. a nice sweet honey-like scent comes off towards the end and blends well with the hop scents. mmm, a hop bomb! tons of bitter skunky hops at first, followed by typical cascade piney grapefruit flavors, blending in nicely (as was the smell) with a deliciously sweet bready caramel malt profile. a medium body beer with a crisp light mouthfeel, very fizzy.. very refreshing and goes down easy. you can't tell it's a double ipa honestly, the booze is very well hidden. an amazing dipa, and a great first impression from this brewery my friend has been telling me so much about for the last year and half or so! what scares me, is he said this isn't their best beer."
"Toppling Golaith is slowly becoming one of my favorite breweries! It wasn't more than a few weeks ago that I heard about TG as their imperial stout, Assassin was hitting Madison. I am always a sucker for high alcohol, special release stouts so I picked up a bottle and researched this brewery that I previously knew nothing about. It wasn't more than a couple of days later that I had the opportunity to get a bottle of Sosus. About two weeks after that I finally drank it and was very, very impressed. "
"Poured from 22 oz bottle from the fridge into my Duvel tulip. Though I have packed up all of my plates, dishes, and cups for my upcoming move, I still have eight tulips in my cupboards to choose from. Priorities."
Bottle (2013)
"Picked up a bottle of this beer, reportedly bottled a bit over a week ago, in one of my periodic cross-border pillages into Wisconsin. Great having two states' distribution within 25 minutes of home! 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. "
"Thanks to Nick Wade for the bottle. Arrived on my doorstep today and drinking it tonight while fresh. Bright gold with light haze, topped with a white foam that has decent retention. On the lighter side of color for a double IPA. The aroma has a blast of citrus hop freshness with a strong grapefruit vibe and hints of sweetness. Very hop focused yet clean, there is just a touch of dank twang that really finishes off the smell and makes it oh so inviting. "
Wow! I haven't been impressed this much lately!
Great Beer! Poured into into snifter glass. Glass present a white head which dissipated quickly. 
"22oz bomber from the 2013 bottling aka super fresh- probably one week old, poured into a FFF teku and quaffed with a friend on 5/5/2013."
"A - Pours a light, cloudy peach/orange color into my chalice. A nice white finger of head disappears quickly and leaves behind some lacing. "
"Pours a light Orange color, finger of head, nice lacing."
Outstanding. Drinkable.
Poured out of a can into a tree house pint glass 
"Not trying to over power. Not grassy, not juicy, not too zesty. This is clean and delicious"
"Probably the most overrated beer I have ever had the displeasure of trying. Dry, dusty, bitter, and bland."
An exceptional IPA that stands out above a sea full of IPAs. Love getting my hands on this beer. Love me some fuzzy baby ducks! This is a beer everyone needs to try at some point.
"Amazing, had it on draft at Olive Bar in Unionville, had 5 of them. If you can find it, drink it. I like it better than the double fuzzy."
"Really excellent IPA. Finally got my hands on some fresh cans this weekend. Opaque pale orange with a lacy white head. Strong aromas of papaya and a whole range of citrus, especially orange. Medium bodied, smooth textured, and pleasantly dry throughout. Lighter and more refreshing, though less complex, than their DIPAs. Of course that's by design. NEBCO's got the winning recipes."
12oz. can into a Fuzzy sensory glass. 
"Golden orange yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Citrus zest, nectarine and mango. Biscuit malt profile. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Lower in carb. Balanced with all flavors melding together. Not really bursting with flavor, but it's nice. Don't really get the super hype on this one. Maybe the balanced nature of it actually elevates it."
"From the tap, in a pint glass, hazy if not opaque, citrusy"
Very nice single hop Showcase. Balance is key here with nice dry finish with just enough juice on the front end.
"Nothing is ever perfect, except if you are talking about FBD IPA then yes, it is perfect."
Look: Translucent straw gold with slight haze and a moderate white head. Light activity. 
On tap at New England brewing company
5 week old.
A 12 fl oz can with no canned on or best before date on it. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.
Cloudy amber appearance with nice head that desipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of citrus. Taste is more of a balanced hoppy citrus with some bitterness.
Look: Amber Golden color. See a little bit of light through it. Fluffy one in a half fingers off of white head. 
Huge shoutout to my NY connection for getting access to this gem!
"Pours burnt Amber. Nice white head. Citrus on the nose. Taste is citrus, orange peels and candied orange. Really tasty. Has a piney finish. Look forward to more from them."
"The body appears turbid with an amber orb in the center and gold around the edges topped by a large, off-white foam that slowly settles with a fuzzy cling."
"A unique taste. Minimal grain, lots of citra hops. Great looking can and name. It's worth waiting an hour in line when they have it available in cans."
"Consumed approximately one and a half weeks after the June canning. Citrus forward with lots of orange, solid but unspectacular mouthfeel. Well done, overall."
Canned a week ago.
"Having loved G-Bot and Coriolis from NEBCO, I had high hopes for this one. And it lived up to the hype. Strong citrus on the nose, the taste follows suit. I put this up there with Squeeze and Julius in the citrusy NEIPA conversation. Connecticut throwing their hat in the ring amongst the big boys from MA/ME/VT/NH."
A 12 oz can (no date) poured into a TH Teku.
Amazing citrus aroma on the pour. Wonderful flavor that's just a bit behind what the aroma promised. Smooth drinker with mild bitterness that doesn't last too long after the swallow. A fantastic example of the New England IPA style.
Not a bad beer at all but not worth all the hype. Very drinkable with a nice finish. I think in my opinion Trailblazer should get more hype
"12 oz can. Pours hazy dull orange with two finger frothy white head, slowly fades leaving scattered lace. Mild citrusy tropical aroma. Balanced malt and tropical fruit, semi sweet taste, dank piney bitter finish. Medium soft feel. Really solid IPA, may not quite up to the hype, but would definitely welcome more."
Fuzzy Baby Ducks poured light orange with about a half inch to inch of foamy lacing up the side of my goblet. I got a nice whiff of general citrus juice but no particular fruit aroma was too predominant. Taste was very nice like fruit hard candy with a bit of piney hop in there as well. A very clean beer did and was not as hazy as traditional NE style IPAs. Very solid little brew here and the label art may be the best out there.
"Love the artwork on this can, but sadly that is not graded. Pours yellowish, on the darker side with decent white head. Great smell, with citrus dominating, but slight floral notes as well. Taste is similar. Nice citrus(more orange rind), but there is a floral presence as well. Finishes slightly bitter, but nothing dank. I'd call this a good example of the evolution of east coast IPA, in that it is starting to be more like Tree House with the big citrus notes, but the bitterness of something like Heady is still there."
"Shocked this is a top 100 beer on BA. I've have many of the other IPAs on the list and this one doesn't fit with the others. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad beer, but also not anything to seek out"
"A standout among so many others that have began to crowd the style. This is OG, if you will (a recipe at least 4 years old as far as I know). Beautifully orange with a mild haze in appearance - like it just so happened to look that way, not trying to be hazy for the sake of in-vogue haziness. Aroma is balanced citrus hoppiness without the sweetness that accompanies many TH IPAs nor the yeastiness of Trillium. It's sort of a distilled representation of the style. Taste follows the nose but introduces a really wonderful creamy mouthfeel that I didn't expect from the appearance or aroma. It's oily in a good way and without being chewy. Finish is crisp with a mild bitterness that reminds you it's beer (a good thing in my book - if I want a fruit smoothie, I'll go to Jamba Juice). For my two cents, this is right up there with my other favorite 'local' citrus-based hoppy beers Julius and Fort Point, but marks out its own unique territory. Amazing stuff and really hoping they can this more often."
Inaugural Fuzzy Baby Ducks in a 12 oz can from the brewery. 3/22/17 tag on the 6-pack
"Really impressed with this beer! Look was a very nice yellowish-orange color, hazy. Half inch head. "
Fresh growler drank on 2/24/17
5
Poured from a 32 oz growler filled at the brewery.
"I don't get the hate'n on this beer. ""Stick with Hill Farmstead, Treehouse, Trillium . . . "
"Great beer! Has all the elements of a great IPA with citrus forward smell, great look and best of all nice finish. May rate Coriolis higher but not many other beers."
"Growler poured into snifter, at Widow Browns"
Amazing aroma. Citrus big time. Taste is much different. I'm picking up citrus fruits and...Apple..? Pleasantly bitter and drying. Very good IPA. But I was expecting epic greatness though.
Outstanding. Amazing smell. Pure citrus. Drank from a growler. Great beer
"A classic. I've been wanting to try this one for years and finally had the pleasure. Very tasty IPA, with Citra as the star of the show. This and Coriolis are probably my favorite from NEBCO."
"I have had the pleasure of having this one a few times. When ever it hits a local restaurant or bar, there is sure to be a line of folks waiting to get it."
People in CT love fuzzy. I just think its an alright citra hop IPA.
"I had a few growlers of this and samples at the brewery. Great beer, great smell, smooth hop taste. Very very good but I think they have a few other hop beers I like more. Another great northeast IPA"
growler purchased 7/1 at brewery. 
"Enjoyed on draft at Cask Republic in New Haven, poured into a modified tulip glass."
"poured into tulip glass on tap at Little pub Wilton CT. Nice golden yellow hue with minimal lacing. Candied orange on the nose with a bit of pine earthiness. The malt profile is minimal, the feel lightly carbonated with an even mouthfeel. Initial hop bite, but has a generous juicy profile and finishes smooth with no bitterness. Very easy drinking, almost sessionable little fruit bomb from NEBCO. I really enjoyed this brew!"
L: Golden orange and apricot hues with a slight hazy body; thin white head and a scant lacing
"Growler fom Brewery: This one pours a hazy golden color. It had a small head and left no lacing. It has a nice nose. Citrus, mango, pineapple. The taste is excellent. Good hop bite and balanced. Citrus, pineapple, mango. As good as advertised!"
"pours a beautiful hazy orange, head dissipates quickly. smell is orange peel, orange juice, and slight geapefruit. no malt whatsoever. taste is great: candied orange, dry citrus, that orange peel, and a very tiny malt back end. this one is citra through and through, NEBCO did a great job with this single hop. feel is fuzzy, as I would hope given the name. great great beer. don't know when I'll ever get my hands on this again because I won't stand in that line, but I hope I do one day."
64 ounce growler poured into a snifter.
"Thank god someone else waited in line in a downpour and not me! Overhyped and didn't deliver. Not a bad beer by any means, but far more pedestrian than people make it out to be."
I thought it was a very delicious beer but I had no idea what a palate destroyer it was. I asked for a taster of Sea Hag (which I love) for comparison and I almost couldn't taste it. We have a winner!
Better then G bot
"I was super excited to finally get to try this, and it lived up to its billing. Love the 'fuzzy yellow' color and the hops explode out of the glass."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a big, stable head."
Pours a hazy orange that is very common of the great NE IPAs. The nose is unlike any other single hopped Citra IPA I've had having more of an earthy pine and follows with the fruitiness in the finish. The body is very refreshing with a good medium bitterness and carbonation and it finishes dry and clean.
Not all it's cracked up to be but a pretty fantastic IPA none the less. The smell is what really got me. One of the best out there. It's like a floral grapefruit explosion in your sinuses rank this a step above Sea Hag and a couple steps below Gandhi Bot.
Tastes like an SOS clone
"This is a really good IPA. One of the best out there? Not. I would never wait in line for this like some BAs have done on a frequent basis. It's balanced, it leaves nice sticky lacing on the glass, and it offers a myriad of citrus notes (if that's your thing). All that said, there's nothing about this beer or the brewer that makes me say, ""damn, I've never tasted that before."" It's been done, and done better. I like your beer NEBCO, but it's not as elusive as you make it seem!"
Growler from the new facility poured into snifter. Fresh. About 10 oz. pour.
"Burnt orange juice. Multiple finger frothy head. Solid sticky lacing. Let's get tropical. Serious tropical nose. Distinct pineapple and other tropics. Great hop profile. Starts with a strong citrus and ends with a mildly dank bitter. Real juicy feel. Medium rare carbonation. Overall, very impressed and pleased with this beer."
"I have had the pleasure of enjoying this beer many times... being within driving distance of NEBCO. Overall, this is one of their best offerings at the brewery. It does not come out often, but when it does, you will have to wait in long lines obtain or get lucky at a bar before it kicks within 30 minutes haha. Look of the beer is a bright yellow, smell is of pure citra hops, taste is anywhere from grapefruit to lemon to lime and so on... Overall super refreshing and light; can't help but crush a few of these pints (if available). Worth seeking out in my opinion, cheers!"
"Another great offering from NEBCO. Unfortunately, this disappears quite quickly, so you either have to be very lucky, or in the know in order to get a taste. Catch it when you can."
It's a solid IPA but I don't get the hype. Other breweries are producing similar grapefruit-y IPAs like this that are cheaper and much easier to find.
"Its is your typical beer Citrusy IPA in taste and smell. Mouthfeel is well carbed and very drinkable. Unfortunately this beer is overhyped. It is a very solid IPA, but I think that its score is reflective of how difficult it is to obtain this beer rather than the actual beer its self. Stick with Treehouse, Trillium, Hill Farmstead, Lawsons, and The Alchemist those are the people brewing the best hops in the world."
Outstanding double IPA! Citra Bomb but still drinkable!!
This beer is da bomb
"Hype aside, it's an outstanding beer. The aroma alone sets off fire alarms in my head, and is something you could smell clear across the room as soon as the growler cap came off. Citrus, some earthiness, peach, and lychee fruit. Pours a very nice light orange to med gold, but lacks stellar head. Taste is pure citra; lemongrass, light melon, peach, grapefruit rind. Highly quaffable."
"Had a 64oz growler of this on the 4th. This is right up there with all of the best IPA's. However great this beer is it is not whatsoever worth the VR'S, PROPS or any other bigger stouts guys are giving up for on here."
"This beer is by far ""the"" most overrated beer I have ever come across. This is the only good beer NEBC brews IMO. This should be there staple. Instead it's seahag which is a complete disappointment. Bissell brothers substance is pretty similar. Go get that it's better."
Smells like man sweat. Tastes like swamp water and dirty diapers. Brilliant!
"L: Hazy orange body topped with a thick, creamy head that leaves a generous lacing."
"This IPA is the definition of hype. Have to admit, I got swept up and traveled well out of my way just to get to a bar that had it on draft. Barely found a parking spot."
"The Ordinary in New Haven delivered. Served slightly cool in a tulip glass. Comes out a lovely hazy golden color, but with minimal head or carbonation. I've had this before a few times and it's always the same case. "
Amazing beer with smooth taste. Perfect bite.
This was such a treat when I had it. Super intense citra hops and absolutely crushable!
Stopped by j. Timothy's for a few Ducks. Excellent pout into tulip glass. Nice smooth flavor. Better than Gandhi in my opinion.
"L - pours an opaque, delicate, glowing orange. Is this where the name comes from? Looks very inviting. "
"Drank on tap at Plan B Burger Bar, Glastonbury, CT"
Love this beer!NEBCO always has great beers but this is one their best
Golden Amber pour. Very crisp. Most drinkable beer I've ever tasted. Lives up the hype. Huge thanks to my cousin Eric for securing me a growler
Poured out as a hazy orange color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is nice and hoppy. The taste is hoppy too and has a subtle sweetness in there also. The feel of the beer is smooth and creamy. Overall this beer is killer.
Pours Hazy orange. Taste follows the nose- what you would expect from citra. Lots of citrus upfront balanced by some pine+bitter at the end. So drinkable. Would drink on a boat with a goat wearing a coat.
Delicious hop flavor that is so beautifully balanced. Tons of tropical flavors and easily drinkable for even your non hophead friend.
A: cloudy pale yellow minimal white head and lacing
"Lovely, beautiful golden brew, topped by a white head with great retention."
Out of a growler. Amazing taste and smell. Great feel and easily drinkable
Had on tap at Three Sheets New Haven 3/2/15. Fantastic beer - lives (largely) up to the hype.
"Genuinely surprised by this one -- thin, brackish and completely unimpressive."
"64oz growler filled 2.20.15- Nice Nose, Citra all day. Very nice. Have been looking for this one for a while. Good to cross off the list. Don't need to chase it anymore but would happily drink more."
This is definitely the most over-hyped IPA I have ever had. 
"Aroma - A punch of citra hops to the face—orange, grapefruit and pineapple most notable in the nose, but also some slight notes of acetic/funk presumedly from the yeast."
"Bright golden body with a decent white head. Smell bursts with citrus right away. Very inviting. Taste starts strong with grapefruit juice, orange peel, and maybe even pineapple and then shifts toward bitter pine resin on the finish. Slick mouthfeel with a west coast style body. Really nice IPA that is crushable and flavorful."
"Very good IPA. Strong tasty hops on the nose with an overall sweet IPA. Finish dies off pretty quickly, but that doesn't take away what a great beer this is."
One of the best I've ever had. Thank you NEBCO
Great brew from a great brewery
Appearance: pours a straw color with hues of orange coming through as well. a 2 finger foamy white head forms and has good retention. huge amounts of haze and cloudiness to it. completely opaque.
"Drank from a 10 day old growler picked up on a trade in CT this past weekend (Thanks Brian!). This is a really great IPA. Amazing fruity/ floral aroma and wonderfully balanced, fruity, hoppy taste. I think it just loses a little (just a tad) on the finish. Very wonderful beer, but maybe not quite worth it for how hard it is to obain. I actually like Gandhi Bot a little better. (note, I have been drinking Dinner and Treehouse Haze the past few days, so my palette has some major competition). Definitely worth drinking if you can get it and maybe the best 6.2% abv IPA I have had."
A: cloudy - unfiltered; golden yellow - SRM 7-8: 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin cap; nice lacing;
64oz growler filled in late November. Thanks Matt. Poured into a stemmed glass 12/5/2014.
"Simply one of the best. If your looking for the juiciest hoppiest IPA out there, this isn't it. If your looking for a PERFECTLY BALANCED IPA, this is the one. The backbone to NEBCOs brews is a force to be reckoned with."
"Black Friday bottle share poured from 64oz growler into Iron abbey tulip. Nose is tropical citrus fruits and soft pine. Taste is citrus followed by a heavy bitter orange pith taste. Overall really tasty IPA. Worth trading for, ehhh...."
"It's a fantastic beer. Can't give it the full 5 because there are a few beers I prefer slightly more ( THB C-9/Julius, Nebco Ten-er #11). Only had to wait ~75 minutes! Love me some citra hops."
The citra hops give this beer incredible aromas and taste
"Fuzzy Baby Ducks is with out a doubt one of the best single hop IPA's out there. Only a handful of beers can match the smell and look of the ducks. The ones that do, are the beers I seek out. World Class."
Connecticut stand up!
best nose i have ever had hands down but its too rare!!!! this stuff is top 5 beers ive ever had
Given to me via fresh growler from the brewery. Not much to say other than the best ipa I've ever had and I've had most of the heavy hitters.
Growler shared by Andrew - thanks. Reviewed from notes.
"This has been a looong time want. Thanks to stillmatic2232, I get half a growler of it!"
2 day old growler...
Out of the blue April release from NEBCO to the delight of their customers: a million thanks to Smutty for braving the lines and for the fresh growler filled 4/16/14 and arrived/consumed 4/18/14. 
"This is one of my first my first highly hyped beers and it lived up to it. Similar in color to Gandhi Bot with a hazy red/orange color and one inch white head. The taste is big on the grapefruit and not much else, maybe some orange or tropical fruit as well, but mainly grapefruit. Motuhfeel is great on this with juicy hops up front and a smooth, almost creamy finish. Overall, this was more than worth it to track down and it easily deserves its perfect score on BA."
"64oz Growler from NebCo. Pours a hazy yellowish orange color with a 1/2 inch of head. Lots of lacing. The nose is a big whiff of tropical fruits. Pineapple, guava, mango, orange and a hint of lemon. The taste mirrors the aroma. Juicy tropical fruits with some lightly toasted malts. Mango, guava, sweet grapefruit, tangerine and light lemon. Some piney hop notes at the finish along with some sweet grapefruit. Medium bodied with a good deal of carbonation. Very drinkable with not much of an alcohol presence. Dry. Overall, amazing IPA."
Reviewed from notes from 1/6/14
"Totally lives up to the hype. Pours a hazy orange with a nice average sized head. Nose is citrus, mostly grapefruit, orange. Taste follows, big citrus, grapefruit is forefront but nice big bitter bite at the end. Extremely drinkable. Excellent excellent beer."
"I was fortunate enough to score several growlers of FBD this holiday season. I'm not sure what to say about this brew; all I want to do is gush. It looks and smells beautiful. The flavor is centered around the hops but remains completely balanced. This is without a doubt the best and most drinkable IPA I have ever had. It has, in many ways, ruined me, because I think about it constantly and wish I had more, but this is the only bad thing to say about it."
64 oz. growler poured into a snifter. 
"So is this a 100 pt rated beer because those that reviewed it as such have never had Zombie Dust, Perpetual, HF Citra. Do the ratings on this site drill down to specific hop categories. IE. Is this reviewed as a 100 pt IPA or a 100 pt Citra hop IPA. Either way I am missing the point. Really good beer for sure. 100 pt really good beer. Not so much."
Finally! Ending 2013 with an amazing brew...
Inch tall white head on a dull orange body. Head recedes to a cap and collar. Sticky step lacing.
"Poured into a hill farmstead tulip, from a big growler, with a very thin head. Beautiful orange hue. Head goes away quickly. It smells amazing, even as I'm pouring it. Very bright citus nose, smells very sweet, too. Grapefruit, orange, some tropical fruits, all the good stuff. Taste follows the nose. So much citra goodness and just a tad bitter to offset some original sweetness upfront. Some floral character in there, as well. Lightly carbonated and thin, goes down easy. Leaves a slight bitter citrus on the tongue after that is just great. This is a very good beer. Reminiscent of some great pale ales. Zombie dust, psuedosue. I could drink a lot more of this."
"Look: Small head, light orangish yellow. Hazy, but not turbid."
"batch 3, 32oz growler filled Saturday, 12/21/13. Consumed Tuesday, 12/24/13."
New batch from the new place
"To me, this is the ever-elusive NEBCo. offering. Gandhi is great, but it's available relatively regularly. This is the beer that had me thinking NEBCo. could give Hill a run for their money, based on the reviews anyway. As such, I and many others opted to wait for around an hour for a portion of their final keg this December. At $10/2L growler, they've already got Hill beat by far. I must admit I come into this review with Susan in mind, which is my second highest review (4.99) and comes in at $16/2L. I judge this a fair comparison considering their close proximity in ratings and geography."
"Been a long wait to try FBD and it is everything I had hoped. Pour that is cloudy gold with spotty white lace that sticks around for the whole glass. Smell really aggressive citrus and some floral. Taste is grapefruit, lemon peel, orange with a bit of grass toward the end of the sip. Feel is creamy with a medium carb and a good body than fully coats mouth leaving a semi dry finish."
"This is an amazing single hop Citra. Just about perfect in every sense. An intoxicating aroma of citra greets the nose, and the taste does not disappoint. Just juicy goodness that should be sought out by any IPA lover."
"Cloudy golden , small head , which lasts throughout."
Thanks to wittyname again! Growler to pint.
"Pours a hazy golden to orange body with straw colored hues beneath the foamy, pure white head, resembling a fuzzy baby duck."
Being an IPA addict and after having read the reviews I drove about an hour to the brewery and picked up a few growlers. Shocked and impressed that NEBco fills a 64oz growler of this stuff for $10. Bravo. And feel free to charge me $15-$18 next time.
"A very cloudy weak tea colored IPA with a decent white fuzz on top (quite appropriately) and generous lacing to follow. The aroma brings intense citrus, grapefruit, orange, lemon, whatever, it’s there in spades almost to a sweet tart conclusion but it includes a little bready grain to give a touch of balance perhaps. I love it. The flavor is “grab your tongue”, Hop Stoopid bitter with the continued hop theme along with a grainy suggestion. This stuff is near mid-bodied but the tiny, brisk carbonation gives it a very lively, summer refreshment feel. It’s pretty intense and the flavor settles into a fruit syrup bite that still carries the grain goodness underneath the hop attack. Man I hope NEB sticks with this one. Sea Hag is a pleasant IPA that I’ll always like, but this moves up there with Stowaway as one of my favorite new IPA’s! Bravo Rob!"
"On tap at Eli's for the tasting. Pumped to try this one after destroying back at the gym and a nice 2 mile 6 min 30 sec average run. Prepping for a backyard Olympics competition with oldcrustacean (3 rounds 5 minutes a piece in the ring, 3 tennis sets, bench/dead lift/squat competition). I had a nice chat with Rob the NEBC owner while enjoying this one. They are really killing it. Hazy orange body with a nice head and sticky lacing that hangs around. The smell is citrusy tropical hops. This beer is bitter but the tropical notes balance it out beautifully. Goes down so smooth... I thought it had a much lower ABV. Between this beer, the new sea hag formula, galaxy, ghandi bot, imperial stout trooper, and gold stock, this is one of my top breweries."
"Could this be one of the best brews ever? Had tons of the initial release, and couldn't wait for it to be brewed again. Had this on tap at New York Pizza in Plainfield. Brought to me in a pint glass, straight from the keg. Here we go. "
Poured from a gorwler into a plain tumbler pint glass at Durge's.
another winner from NEBCO.
"On tap at The Winchester, right across the street from NEBCO in the presence of some awesome BA's. Standard pour into a pint glass. Review coming from some notes I took on my phone...hey, ticks a tick!"
Had on tap at Prime 16 in New Haven.
Just had this beer on cask from a local bar.
"I dont review many beer but this one I had to. This is a non biased opinion even though they are my favorite brewery and easily the best in CT, if not New England. I was also the first person to receive a growler of this!(or so I was told, thought that was cool)"
Got my growler filled today at the brewery. Day two of the beer's existence. 
64oz growler into Duvel tulip. Filled this afternoon; beer was released yesterday.
A-Pours a soupy peach-juice color. Off-white bubbles create a cool film atop the brew. Completely murky. Looks like some sort of fruit juice. Impressed by its complete lack of clarity.
"A: Pours a very hazy golden-orange color, with a small white head. "
"On-tap at the brewery, poured into a NEBCO pint glass. "
"Had on tap. First Curiosity beer for me despite several Tree House trips. Pours hazy orange yellow in color with half inch head. Taste is citrus, starfruit, peach, melon, and bubblegum. Light bodied, slightly bitter and moderate carbonation. Amazing. Would get this if it were a regular offering. Has a Tree House taste but tastes different. A real treat."
Shared with JLindros. You're the man Dean.
"Growler, big thanks to rudzud"
"Poured from a growler (yes, a growler) filled at the brewery 04/10/18."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of tangerine, melon, cantaloupe, watermelon, and bubblegum. It tastes of tangerine, melon, cantaloupe, watermelon, and bubblegum. It is very light and crushable. This beer tastes like it was brewed in Monson, excellent."
L - Had to drag my ass all the way out here for a pour. It actually looks nitrogenated with a very tightly foamy head. Super sticky lacing. Darkish orange and thick haze all around. 
"12oz bottle. Poured out a cloudy orange color with golden highlights and a small, off-white head of foam. It smelled of tropical fruits, orange peel and caramel. Bitter piney hop bite with grapefruit, mango and orange. Sweet caramel backbone."
Appearance - The beer poured the color of yellow Tang if such a thing exists. 
"Relatively fresh bottle from mid September that I received in a recent trade. Extremely murky and cloudy yellow but not at all dark. Aroma is kind of muted, citrus. Flavor is your typical citrus and fruit hazy IPA."
Bottled 5 weeks ago.
"An amazing double IPA without the overwhelmingly acidic, bitter, grapefruit taste. Exceptionally smooth with a unique & refreshing nose. Stands out in the crowd of IPAs and with an ABV of 8%, it packs a punch, but the flavor is uncompromised. IMO, THE BEST IPA I've ever had."
"Omg, this was so much better than I expected. It smells like pineapple and fresh satsumas--defintely tastes like some kind of citrus. At $4 a bottle, I was wondering how they got away with charging locals in Louisiana that much. I get it, now!"
"Appearance: Pours somewhat cloudy and in the orange direction of goldenstraw; the head builds to two fingers and retains until rocky, leaving a nice curtain of lace"
"Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter glass. Pretty excited to try this. So let's see! This beer pours out EXTREMELY hazy for not being the double dry hopped version. It's like juice and pale in color. It forms a one finger white and dense crown. I can smell juicy citrus notes as soon as I started pouring. Putting my nose to the glass, they become more prominent. Citrus juice with oranges, mango and even melon notes. The taste comes in with that juiciness as well but ends the build up and doesn't end up blowing me completely away but being very very good. This doesn't have that soft pillowy feel that most I've had from this style do. It seems to go in and cut straight through all the way instead of floating with softness. I do like it but find it kind of crazy that it's achieved this high of a status on here, but oh well! I'd get it again! And if they can make it like this over and over again with consistency, then that explains it!"
Canned 8/13/18. 
Poured a hazy golden orange with a finger of white head that dissipated rather quickly.
"I always get nervous trying big-hyped beers for the first time, as the expectations are often unrealistic. But this one surpasses expectations in that is really does stand out uniquely and positively. The primary notes of uniqueness center around the strong onion notes in the nose and tongue, which are a little odd but kind of funky, and the strong, balancing stone fruit and tropical fruit characteristics that provide stellar IPA personality. Really delicious and memorable beer that I’ll happily drink anytime I find it."
Hazy light gold color with white cap and great lacing.
Looks like a screwdriver 
"On draft at Brass Tap, Tuscaloosa, AL."
"It poured a hazy apricot golden color with a foamy white that leaves nice lacking down the entire glass. Smell is very much citrus( first I thought tangerine) then after testing realized it was all grapefruit. The taste is grapefuit but not overpowering, a nice tart yet sweet. It does have a little hop bite at the end but a great balance to it. Overall all I can say is WOW. This is a must try for everyone."
"Great IPA, there is a unique aroma immediately after you open the bottle that is sweeter then the typical IPA but has a potent earthy citrus aroma. The flavor matches well but there is less sweetness and there is a dry finish. Well worth seeking out."
Excellent fruit bomb with one of the most delectable IPA nose ever; however suffers from being one noted.
"Pours a super hazy, orange juice orange-yellow body with a one finger white head that reduces to leave spotty lacing. "
"This double IPA is near perfection for me. Look, smell, taste, body. Does all of the things that I want "
"First had in New Orleans, Mardi Gras 2018, poured from 12-oz. bottle into faceted hotel water glass, and have had on draft since. Not too pretty, and the burst of wonderful citrus and tropical aromas is gone pretty quickly after the pour, but this is a huge and satisfying DIPA."
"A very good beer. However, I think it's a terrible value. I stopped into a local bar and grill (in Louisiana less than an hour from the Brewery) and a standard 16oz pint was $11 while Space Dust was on tap for $6. 4 pks are running $14-15. It just isn't worth the money."
"Tasted in a Rastal Teku from a crowler on June 29, 2018. Look is hazy orange gold. Smell and taste is guava, tropical fruit, dank hops and sweet malt. Feel is full in body yet soft and fuzzy on the palate."
Bottle dated 06/06/18 from Modica Market Seaside FL
"An excellent ipa. Has a very soft mouthfeel and is brimming with flavor. The nose isn't as good as others, but in fairness to the beer it is almost a month from the bottling date."
"OMG!! AFLAVOREXPLOSION!! yes pineapple, yes guava, delicate alcohol balance, hidden well with lingering taste of ""watsnext"" you will NOT be disappointed with this brew."
"Excellent Double! I have been wanting to try this, and finally got the chance."
"Pours a very cloudy yellow orange color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is mild. Aroma is excellent. Fresh, citrus. Somewhat piney. Taste follows the same way. This is very, very good."
Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin white head. Nose is of citrus peel and floral. Taste floral forward which is interesting. Light citrus and a bit of pine as well. Medium to full bodied and slightly creamy. Pungent bitter finish to it.
Looked and smelled the part but doesn't deliver the goods compared to other of the new breed... Strange burnt malt or hair spray finish after a terrific burst of juicy hops... Starts like a lion and finishes like a lamb.... Would love to get fresh on tap as this has been a bucket list brew for a while for me
Disappointing. Overrated. Sad.
"I was told this is the best beer made in Louisiana. Based on a sample size of 20, I cannot disagree. "
It really surprised me! Really really good!
Opaque maize with a moderate white froth leaving a uniform garter lace.
8/16/17 bottle drank on 9/6/17
"Batch 25 - 7/27/17. From bottle. Deep cloudy, orange color with medium-low foam head upon pour. Tropical and fruity aromatics which are matched by the abundantly juicy flavors. Pineapple, mango, orange... abundant. Feel is soft and smooth... maybe mildly dry but almost not. Very easy to drink."
"A murky, fruity, juicy, and smooth Juice bomb DIPA. Very good beer!"
12oz bottle poured into a tulip
"elite level ipa here, way ahead of the trend in the east coast style, and something really special. huge thanks to my new orleans hookup for sending some out, so stoked to finally drink this beer of lore! a nice hazy golden to straw color out of the bottle, no visible sediment in here, no chunks or particulate, and a tall white head, airy but lasting. pretty beer in the style, not so heavy looking or milky as many of them are, more refined. the aroma is just awesome, probably has to be some citra in here, the beer just bursts with ripe melon and citrus notes, so soft though, no abrasive bitterness or vegetal hop matter caught up in here, its cleaned up, mellow rather than intense, but still so pungent, really mouthwatering. the flavor is about the same, but there has to be more than just citra going on, its so well rounded in its fruitiness and freshness, its a truly brilliant hop complexion here, and this is what makes the beer so famous, it has wide appeal without the bitterness, just a crazy dry hopped juiciness, and oh so fresh. not a trace of its alcohol strength, and a nice creamy mouthfeel that really makes it feel rich and special, but its also very dry. some oils lingering, citra hops forever in the finish, or something like them, and overall just a splendid ipa from these guys. a new high bar in the style for me, so stoked to have been able to drink a few of these! famous for a reason!"
"Smell: This just jumps out of the glass with over ripe tropical and juicy citrus fruit. Pineapple,mango, sweet fresh peach, orange, grapefruit. Some honey malt sweetness. Along with some herbaceous notes. 4.75/5"
"32 oz. crowler. Hazy pale orange. Smells of tangerine, some light mango, and some garlic. Tastes of tingly citrus, sweet pale malt, garlic. Some garlicky and resiny bitterness and a lingering sweetness in the back end. Medium body with soft carbonation. Excellent and nice to have a big IPA that doesn't taste enormous."
"First had 7/24/17 at home. This may be the cloudiest, murkiest beer I have ever enjoyed. It's a dull yellow and smells like Tropicana. The body is like a milkshake, or a ""hop-shake"" if you will. The taste is a juicy fruit, orange, tropical medley with a medium bitterness. Amazing beer I will be recommending to all my trading buddies."
"12oz bottle, about 2 weeks old (manifested on 7/6/17) poured into a snifter glass 7/21/17. "
"WOW. I had this beer right after a Sasion, explosions of celery and hops. Super thick mouthfeel and incredible juiciness. This beer is incredible. If you can get your hands on it please do. Really clean flavor after the sip is done and settled. No bitterness or dry feel. Seriously this beer is a treat. A must get IMO"
"Pours like orange juice. Smells of juicy hops with a tinge of wacky tobacco, musty after smell. The taste is THICK of hoppy goodness. It isn't as fruit juicy as the smell and color indicate, but it is a superb beer."
Cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Mild citrus and hops aroma. Taste is a nice blend of citrus and hops which is a little on the mild side.
"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a hazy golden orange color with a thin wisp of a white head. Light lacing spider webs nicely around the glass. The smell starts off with a sharp sweet to crisp and bitter onion and grassy hop oils leading into bitter grapefruit pulp and rind. Light pine swarms in underneath. The taste takes on the bittersweet orange rind persona well. Bitterness accustoms itself well into the aftertaste and finish. Mostly a wet bittersweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping quality about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing a bitter juicy citrus quality to hit my tongue. Overall, this confirms the idea that great beer can be found anywhere. Find this gem, and you’ll find your Diamond in the rough in the South."
Was not as blow away by the taste as I thought but man it is high quality. The smell is like getting slapped with a pineapple or citrus bomb. Head is alright I don't really put much stock in that stuff. After taste is great coupled with the 8% makes for a good night.
Solid brew - glad I got to try it but a little bit of a let down for me. Nothing unpleasant here but I expected more. Smooth and drinkable but not a ton of flavor IMO. Worth a try but don't go nuts tracking it down.
Bottle dated 4/7/17. Very juicy and dank with a big hop punch that doesn't linger. Looks and smells like fresh OJ. Infinitely crushable. Well done Parish.
"Appearance: hazy yellow, totally opaque; it reminds me of liquified pollen or lupulin. The head is a 1/2 finger of off-white with poor retention, which is what prevents this beer's appearance from scoring higher. "
Poured from a 12 oz bottle (bottled 01/11/2017) into a Parish Teku. 
"Poured into a wine glass. A hazy golden straw color with a frothy white head. Bright aromas of grapefruit, pine, and earthy tones. The taste followed with a fantastic balance of hoppy flavors as noted in the aroma. Beautifully balanced with a sturdy yet restrained malt presence A world-class IPA. Well done."
"Look: beautifully hazy, thin .5 inch white head, gorgeous orange color"
Jan 2017 Batch
Batch mid-July 2017.
"12oz bottle, manifested on 11.15.16, poured into a Three Floyds Eye of the Beholder Pint Glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"11/14 batch. Seems off for such a highly rated IPA. Pours dark orange with very little head. Aroma is dank and vegetal. There is some citrus hiding somewhere, but mostly overwhelmed by the dank herbal notes. Taste is dank and herbal as well with lots of malt, ripe orange, grapefruit pith. Taste is messy and muddled. Does not taste fresh. Mouth feel isn't bad, but its a little flat. Much preferred other IPAs I received in the same box like Bloom and Crowd Control. Need to try another batch of this."
The beer comes in a pale to medium amber with a medium haze.
"Shouts out to man like Tim on the plug! Cheers bro. Very nice bronze color, see-through appearance with some sediment and a short but lasting head. Smell hit me when I popped open the 12 oz. bottle but it really explodes once poured. Citrus smorgasbord on the nose! A little dank and floral but its all about the orange and grapefruit here. Taste follows nose with pineapple and stone-fruit in the mix. Soft up front and ending dry, the sip is very balanced in flavor and feel. This is a world class DIPA that is most definitely worthy of the hype."
"This is good but not great. The bottle is a few months old so I'm not getting the freshest batch available. And maybe it could be a little colder. It's smooth and creamy, with a creme brulee flavor on top and citrusy underneath."
"It's a very good DIPA, but does it deserve to be on the top 250? Probably not. It certainly pours beautifully, but I've had a lot better than this. I've heard this one varies by batch though, so I wouldn't be against trying it again down the line."
This is the Gold standard to which all IPAs should be held to
"Aroma is resiny, with solid grapefruit and tons of mango, nectarines, papaya. Tons of tropical and citrus fruit."
12 oz bottle courtesy of drummermattie02 pours a very hazed orange color with a small cap of sticky head. Decent lace for the little foam that initially formed.
This is probably the juiciest beer I have ever tried. It's super crushable and attacks the sides of my tongue with the most fulfilling blast of flavor I've ever experienced. If you've never tried Ghost you are doing yourself an incredible diservice and are probably missing out on at least 15% of your lifetime happiness over all....
Pours a cloudy light orange. Looks like a glass of orange juice. Nose is a mixture of tropical fruits.
A friend of mine in Louisiana sent me a batch of these. I loved it.
"This beer is an example of a world class beer. It smells juicy, tastes juicy and dank. There is so many citrus flavors hitting your senses at one time it's hard to describe the sensation. The malt background is balanced nicely with the hop bomb it accompanies. Traded some ghost for Zombie Dust and my buddy who got the ghost was floored by it. Good stuff Parish."
5.5 week old bottle
"Drank the most recent batch (5/16-19/2016) straight from the bottle. Even a month later the juicy factor holds up fairly well. I know it doesn't pour the prettiest, but it presents very similar to many of the other unfiltered East Coast DIPA's; cloudy and slightly orange. While the malts come out more after a month, Ghost still has a great taste and slight juicy feel to it. Not astringent. Everyone should try this beer at least oh, say, four times a month."
Savor 2016
This pours out hazy almost like a light cider. Sweet floral fruit on the nose. The taste is sweet with citrus (tropical ugly fruit?) and the bitterness only comes in on the back end. A light carbonation to this one but it's exactly right. Absolutely wish I could get larger than a 4 pack at my local spot.
Cloudy orange note in the appearance. Smell and taste are way juicy. Nice mango note with a moderate pine. Nice mix between the two. Heavy body with a nice body. Very little carbonation but enough to give good texture. Go for it
"Everything about this beer is as it should be. It looks like a hazy fruit juice, which hints at the smell and flavor. The smell is citrus, tropical, floral, and slightly piney. The taste follows the nose. Huge juice flavor from the hops, and a balanced bitterness on the back. Wow!"
"Dank, hazy sweet hoppy goodness here. First time having GITM and very impressed. Tons of citrus. A bit sweeter than many other DIPAs out there but in a good way. Highly recommend it. Well done Parish!!"
"This is one superb brew. Got 2 in a trade that were a month old, and can only imagine what it tastes like fresh. Hazy, hop, and stupid good."
"If American hops have commonly carried the mere suggestions of citrus and tropical fruit flavors, then these newer, sexier, juicier hops don't simply suggest fruit, but they nearly overwhelm with them!"
"This beer is a total beast! Hazy, Dank, Fruity, Crisp. Pours a thick hazy orange The look of this beer is one of kind.. Smell is dank and citrus. Easily the best DIPA I've ever had. The best beer not many know about yet outside of Louisiana."
"Many thanks to NolaHopHead for the trade on this one. Pours a deep orange-gold with one finger of creamy off-white head that holds a dense collar with patches of oily lacing. Hazy. Turbid. Beautiful. I can appreciate a nice clear IPA, but I have to admit, there's something about these murky masterpieces that really butters my biscuit."
Coming from NE hops I tend to judge IPAs based on that. And this beer didn't disappoint. Very smooth and great tasting.
"Friend from a bottle, nice fresh brew on date. Very nice floral nose, lower malt for a southern IPA, and overall very palatable. For me personally it lacks a crisp feel and just doesnt really pop"
"Top notch IPA for sure. Got a lot of those NE Hops characteristics with the hazy appearance, heavier body, and straight up juicy notes. I'm not going to compare it with the likes of those NE IPAs, but safe to say, it is certainly in that ballpark. One of the better IPAs i have had."
"Pours a beautiful turbid, murky orange. Small white head with not much lacing. "
Poured from bottle- strong aroma with great hoppines! Looked for this beer while in New Orleans without success- snagged in trade. Really a well balanced beer and at 100 IBUs this one is worth the search.
"Pours a murky light amber with an off white, one finger head that ends up as a thin skim. A swirl puts perma-lace on the glass."
"Very refreshing, great IPA!"
"Based on the look, smell, and previous ratings I thought this would be a home run instead it's just another good IPA that depends on the batch?"
"Look: Hazy, murky orange you can barely see through"
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Belgian snifter. Manifested on: 01/13/16
"Bottle pour into a taster. Dank, grapefruit, a bit of sweetness, medium bodied. Excited to see these types of beer pop up in unexpected places across the country!"
L: Turbid and hazy golden hues with a generous 1cm white foamy head and moderate retention
"Batch 9 bottles 2/15/16. Last two bottles of the batch I lucked into on my last day in New Orleans. Pours a seriously murky and cloudy bright orange. Looks like orange juice. One finger off white head. Beautiful looking in he glass. Aroma combines notes of mosaic and citra. Orange, grapefruit, pine, dankness, and some stone fruit. Taste starts with a big pop of bitterness with waves of dankness and huge orange and pine from the mosaic. Very dank finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and the malt bill provides a nice amount of sweetness to mix with the dank. Tastes very much like the mosaic forward Dipas from Cellarmaker. A great double IPA worth seeking out."
"L: Orange haze, 1 inch head, minimal lacing, some sediment."
Hazy golden orange. White head. 
Fresh bottle poured into snifter.
"Hazy, dank, tropical, juicy, delicious. Dont look now, but Louisiana has a New England style IPA that is worth seeking out. If I could get this locally Id always have some on hand, its legit."
12 oz bottle into tulip glass. 1/13/16
Great...that is all
"This is an incredible juice bomb like so many of the MA beers that are so popular. Incredible aroma, tastes like juice mixed with beer. Need more of this in my life!"
Drank from a 12fl.oz. bottle acquired in a trade with DanPing
"This may not look or feel like a NE IPA, but the taste is certainly comparable. Likely the most under the radar beer I know of based out of Louisiana. I've had two batches now and I believe the latest version (from Jan 2016) is the best. It makes me think they're continuing to perfect their craft!"
"L: Hazy/cloudy orange hue. Can't see through the glass. Slight head - 3/4"", Nice lacing"
Pours a hazy thick unfiltered yellow pineapple juice looking color with a 1 inch foamy head. Smells of tropical pineapple juice. Has a nice sweet tropical flavor up front followed by a medium bitter aftertaste. Wow this is really well done.
That's a hop bomb with an flavorful head aroma! They did this one very well!
Enjoyed this one. Nice hoppy treat! This was sent to my by a trading partner so it was not the freshest batch but it was still excellent and I hope to try it again sometime when its even fresher.
Smells and tastes JUICY JUICY
An unbelievable beer! This needs more distro
L - Hazy Orange
A: Hazy orange/yellow with off white head that dissipates fast into moderate lacing
Golden in color. Can't see through this one. Love the look- beautiful and super unfiltered. Taste is bittery and citrusy forward. Very strong in taste. Crisp finish but a palate wrecker. This has a super unique flavor profile.
A hazy orange/yellow color with good lacing. The smell has an inviting earthy almost dank hop smell to it. The taste is a predominant bitter hop taste while still brig decently balanced. The finis is more bitter and not quite as good. Overall a solid IPA.
12oz bottle 2 weeks old into a snifter
"What is there left to say about the best beer from Louisiana? Hoppy, fragrant, and balanced are the words I'd used to describe it. The release of this beer typically results in a day-off-work scramble around town to locate it but it's well worth it."
"Batch 6, bottled 8/7/15. For my tastes, this is as good for this style as I've ever had. Great hazy/cloudy look in the glass, an awesome aroma that hits you from the moment you open the bottle, and the taste is muy bueno. Citrusy, juicy, great mouthful, and great finish. Very close to Batch 4 from March, often described as hoppy Sunny D. Drank it by side with fresh Zombie Dust, and would hate to have to choose which one to have as my third pour. Much better (for me) than Batch 5"
Mango double ipa in August 2015. Best beer I've ever had
Batch 6 (bottled 8/6/15): Love the haziness look--not overly hazy but a nice orangy cloud that you can't see all the way through. The nose has a great powerful citrus to it. Upon tasty it's not overly boozy and the citrus definitely comes through. Even hops on the palate from start to finish. Very smooth!
A-Bronze/orange color with some haze and thin head.
"12 oz bottle. Hazy orange with thick fluffy white head, slowly recedes leaving lace the entire way. Really big citrusy nose, some tropical fruit. Wow I love the taste of this beer, juicy but not super sweet, super dank citrus peel and piney hops are prevalent, not harsh. Mouthfeel is so soft. Overall you wanna just crush another one but must resist with the abv. Outstanding DIPA, one of my favorites."
"The best IPA i've ever had. If i were to drink this in the winter i would probably say something with a bit more resin taste would be better lol. Good balance, you dont realize youre drinking a double ipa until it's too late. Smell is strong citrus, mouth feel is smooth."
Poured from very fresh 12oz bottle into Spiegleu IPA glass. Bottled on date was 8-7-15.
"Had at The Bulldog on Magazine St 08/10/15- the very first pour from the first keg of the year!!!!! Such a damn fine beer- very well balanced. Copper to gold color with a slightly hazy character and thick white head that settles to a thin lacing. Smell is resinous pine layered thick over some tropical fruit notes, simply perfect. Taste reminiscent of smell with hops and an added fruit kick that can best be described as reminiscent of pineapple- does a very nice job of taming the hops. Mouthfeel is slick and clean, finishes dry with a minimal linger. Overall, there aren't many beers I'll actively seek out- this is an exception, and for good reason. I've had more than my fair share of SE regional brews, and this is my vote for the best."
It's a very solid dipa. However it's kinda lack luster. Dunno if it's be cause its a couple weeks old but it's just kinda straight fwd nothing special.
poured 12oz bottle into snifter. Bottled 5/7/15.
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (""manifested"" on 5/7/15) into Gnarly Barley 1 year snifter."
Look: Orange colored body. Dense white head with multi-size bubbles. With a tilt of my multi-use snifter = Attractive melting legs and curtains with artistic lacing left behind.
"very good beer! Lots of citrus, clean, fresh taste. Lots of hops, but not over powering, easy finish."
"I miss the citrus from the last batch, but still an exceptional beer"
"Hell of a job Andrew!!! Balance is the main reason this is up there with the big guys!!! No 8.5% anywhere!!!! Hard to achieve this level of balance, and yes its more balanced than Pliny!! I think they're gonna like it! Cheers to the best brewery in Louisiana!!! Much love from the Midwest!!!"
"On tap today at the brewery. Absolutely delicious, the best beer to ever come out of Louisiana. Can definitely compete with other big name IPAs/DIPAs. Excellent!"
"Great citrus nose, dry grapefruit taste and a bitter dry finish."
3/2/15 stamped 12 oz bottle
"Cool looking label....make it a better mouthfeel, and we are talking world class"
Wow what a surprise...haven't smelled a beer with this profile since double sunshine...excellent taste as well...can't wait to get my hands on more
"Pours an off gold clear yellow, this beer has some big pine smells, along with sweet pineapple. It is a big hop taste. A very nice tropical punch, followed by a slightly sweet malty finish. Nice carbonation, this is a thick and creamy IPA. Seek out the Machine!"
"Parish Ghost in the Machine has a thin, off-white head, a murky, milky, orange-gold appearance, and fairly heavy lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of sweet, strong, and acidic hop resin. Taste is the same, with white bread and noticeable, yet, not particularly harsh or dynamic hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Parish Ghost in the Machine finishes semi-dry and surprisingly drinkable for an 8.5% alcohol ale."
"Bottled 2 days ago and is very good! You know it's a great beer when your fiance doesn't make her typical ""yuck"" face."
I never realized how good this beer is until I had it fresh.
Bottled late last year
"Wow! Extremely hard to get my hands on this beer, but found myself near the brewery and stopped by. The smell, oh my god the smell! Super piney dank happy perfection. Medium body, wonderful citrus/resin flavor. Did I mention it smelled great? 8.5% will sneak up on you with the fantastic drink ability. "
"Was expecting more out of this. Not much aroma, tastes like it has promise, but fades quickly"
"Very proud this beer is poured in my home state. Reminds me of the beers I've enjoyed in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Parish has certainly captured the art of the American double IPA. Resinous, delicious, savory and long lasting while still refreshing."
12oz bottle manifest on 08/06/15. Poured into a tulip glass.
"Excellent brew. Each batch is brewed a bit different but each one is a really solid DIPA. Floral nose, really good hop bite, and possibly the smoothest drinking DIPA you'll ever have. If you get a chance please try this. Possibly the best beer brewed in Louisiana."
"Latest batch bottled on 11/20/2014. Even better than I remember. Pours a somewhere on the lighter side between golden and copper, with a 1-finger head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is intoxicating. I could just live in there for a while. Lots of tropical fruits, pine, and even some floral notes. Mouthfeel is medium with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste matches up with the aroma - lots of citrus. Definitely a hop bomb, with just enough malt to balance it out. I would rate this one up there with just about any DIPA currently being brewed."
Pours a bright golden-orange with heavy haze in the glass. Seemed clearer on the pour. 1+ finger head is eggshell white and has good retention. Medium amount of spiderweb lacing.
"Appearance: Huge,foamy, sticky off white head which clings to the glass and doesn't want to go away."
"Just released, as they said “manifested on 27 Aug14”. Utterly fresh. Getting one from the last pack in the store, it comes and goes out immediately. Thanks so much for the Beer Sommelier from Stein’s in New Orleans for not letting me go home without proving this local beauty, although they were running out of it."
"Blind IPA challenge winner of 12 different well known breweries. This was fantastic, huge tropics and way too crushable Parish knocked this one out of the park."
"Had this the first go-around and loved it. It has been re-released, this time in 4-pk 12oz bottles. Even better!"
Drove over to Broussard from Lafayette today for the second release of Ghost in the machine. 
"Bottle pour at the pre-FWIBF bottle share held at the Adelaide Inn in Paso Robles, CA."
"Poured into a snifter. This one was hard as hell to find. Got it at Acquistapace's in Covington, LA."
Pour at the Ithaca Luminous bottle release.
"Parish Brewing Company - Ghost In The Machine, poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
A - Pours a hazy orange and a bit of gold with a two finger eggshell head. I'd say this is a great looking beer.
Just... Damn this is good.
"Batch 6 bottled 8/6/2015. Poured into tulip. Pours a hazy deep orange copper color with a one finger head on top. Leaves lacing while the head recedes. Smell is amazing, big citrus and tropical notes, smells like a juicy hop bomb. Taste follows the nose with big citrusy orange peel, dank hops, piney resin and a bit of sweetness to balance out all that hop character. Mouthfeel is medium with a balanced finish. Overall, this is the best double IPA brewed in Louisiana. The hop character, the balance, and the aroma make this beer world class."
Bottle dated on 2/19/13. 750ml bottle.
"Been anxiously awaiting this beer for nearly a year, since talking to the owner of Parish Brewing about it. It finally made its debut in mid-February, and the question remained: would it live up to the hype, or would it be just another double IPA?"
Let me preface this review by saying that hunting this beer down (it wasn't easy)was worth the effort.
Poured into a Parish Brewing tulip
Poured from bomber into a tulip
Had to give this a proper review. 750 ml bottle into a snifter.
"Amazing taste with Molasses, Pineapple,Lime and almonds. Good taste with great balance. Amazing sour beer. Color is straw yellow. Good carbonation. Great drinking."
"Really hazy pale yellow color with no foam. Aroma has intense marzipan and almond extract with lemon notes and citrusy hops. Taste follows with almond bitterness and citrus sour candy. Medium body with soft carbonation. Really unique flavors, great balance, dry and fruity."
"This one pours a very hazy and creamy looking orange, with a small head and lots of lacing."
"Opaque yellow-orange with a thin, spotty film and thin bubbly ring."
Expected more..
Smooth as a baby's bum
"Hoppy, balanced, crushable. Incredible that's 8.5%,."
Canned on 7/11/18
On tap at the tilted barn
"It looks like a glass of REALLY pulpy orange juice with a dollop of tan foam slathered on top, similar to many other beers in this style. The nose is the obligatory citrus bomb, with spicy nectarines and passion fruit - but do I also detect some malt?"
"Medium gold and hazy, with a fat white head... This is a delicious beer... soft and plush with juicy fruits both tropical and from the orchard - little bit of a danker tangy undercurrent rounds it off nicely... A superior NE-DIPA entry... 3/27 canning..."
Outstanding
Not for the faint of taste. Real good.
Released 12/14/17; drank 1/5/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"After trying four beers so far from TB, I loved two and kinda hated the other two, so there was a lot at stake when I cracked this one open. "
Thanks to Ryan for sharing this can.
"Golden in color. Looks like a mango smoothie. Turbid. Orange, peach puree and Grapefruit juice. Biscuity, cracker malt. Medium bodied. Smooth, lower carbed, creamy. Nice amount of citrus bitterness. Real good."
"Beautiful soft orange citrus forward creamy double IPA. Hoppy, not to sweet, bitterness not there so you can enjoy on the colder side if you want it to be a little more crisp. Not much else you can ask for IMO. Could have a little more carbonation but overall an amazing double IPA worth the lineup if you're into that or a decent trade. Cheers"
"Straight up orange juice Northeast DIPA. Not quite bright orange haze in appearance. Smells like something you'd have to drink for breakfast, and tastes pretty much the same. Soft smooth mouthfeel with low bitterness bite. Honestly, I'm very glad to have my first visit to Tilted Barn include pours and cans of this beer. It's destined for the top 250 here on the site where it will likely spend a long while."
"All you can say about this beer is damn that is an amazing DIPA! ""The Chosen One"" is a good name for it. I still taste the hops in my mouth a half hour after drinking it. I actually caught a buzz from the one beer. It was so smooth, fluffy soft and drinkable the 8.5% abv is never even noticed. It's a little sweet, very balanced with hoppy, citrusy goodness. I would put it against any TH or Trillium Beer. Definitely one of the best if not ""the"" best DIPA I've ever had. I think I need to take a beercation to Rhode Island!"
Been hearing a lot about this place. Let's see how they stack up!
"pours out a super hazed golden yellow color with a dense and bright white head, sick lacing. aromas are creamy orange, melon, papaya, bubblegum. on palate is orange creamsicle, mango, peaches, doughy malts, sugary and gummy sweetness, some green herbaceous notes and a subtle hit of spice and danky pine on the finish. mouthfeel is medium bodied with some really nice fluff to it. overall"
"For my palate, this is one of those rare beers that just wows you into drinking more than you probably should. Cloudy; excellent head retention; lacing for days. The nose is a beautiful mix of tropical and herbaceous; the taste follow suits. I get a ton of Galaxy hops. The feel is prickly; chewy; tongue-smacking. I didn't go into great depth with this one, but I'll say this, if you've ever had Tree House Green, which I love (disclaimer), this is Green done better. It also features that so-called Tree House bubblegum element that so many people rave about. I'm not even kidding. This beer is LARRRGE."
"Poured 2/12/2017 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery the previous day, into an imperial pint glass."
"750ml swingtop growler filled on 12/30/2015 and served in a tulip. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a tight, quarter inch, bright white head. Head eventually dissipates towards the shoulders leaving a soapy slick. Spots and swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Big juicy nose - orange, pith and a hint of stone fruit. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of mango and a light herbal/medicinal bitterness at the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a pleasant, even carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a very good DIPA with lots of tropical fruit notes. Malt bill comes off a little bit thin for the style; however, it's quite drinkable with a well-hidden abv. This beer would be great in cans."
Amber appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a slight citrus touch. Taste is a fairly strong hoppy with a slight touch of citrus.
Appearance – Hazy deep yellow body with a one finger head.
Great tasting beer. Goes down smooth. Very refreshing.
"Wow. Tropical paradise. Thank you Lord, thank you God. Say n'more,... nudge nudge, aye aye. Love it."
"Pours nice dark orange yellow. Good amount of haze with nice pillowy head. Nose is super ripe melon,berries with some minty scents coming through. Pretty dank. Nice! Mouthful is good and coating making the flavor profile all that much better. Front end palate follows the nose with nice ripe apricot and melon with flavors of berries , kiwi, and serious resinous mid to end palate blast leaves you rather stunned. The flavor builds throughout the sip and bitter dry finish is perfect. Flavor bomb with tons of tropical flavors make this amazing. A little more harsh on the palate than say, treehouse but every bit as good. This beer knocks it out of the park. Top of the line. Prob my favorite from this brewery. I need more!!!"
Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. Thank you Ryan for hooking me up with this one. 
"12 oz can poured into a tulip. Darker gold in color. Dank aroma with grapefruit. Taste is the same...tons of grapefruit and a nice bitter finish. Medium bodied and not too heavy. Overall, this surprised me in that it’s this good."
Best IPA that Nebco produces. Perfectly executed. Get your hands on some as soon as you can because this is the real deal.
"One of the greatest beers I've ever had. Can release yesterday and I got my maximum allotment of 12 cans. This is hazier, more obviously ""New England"" in style than NEBCO's other DIPAs. Peachy yellow in color. Thick, dense head that goes nowhere. Room-filling aromas of mango, cantaloupe, orange zest, strawberry, and spearmint. Overwhelmingly flavorful on the palate, insanely resinous and dry, still fruity, with a finish that lasts for minutes. In appearance and aroma, this reminds me of the best DIPAs coming out of Vermont like Foley Brothers Prospect. What sets this apart is the abundance of bitter resin and clean dryness that balances the fruit and creates a more exciting, more complete DIPA experience. Sometimes a beer is so well made and so delicious, you just have to say, ""This is perfect."" Well, this is perfect."
On-tap at the brewery. Enjoyed on the icy trip up from NY to MA for Christmas leave in December 2017.
"On tap at the brewery. Golden straw, cloudy but not full haze, pure white thick foamy head."
"Light golden yellow orange in color. Cloudy in appearance. Dank, grass, melon, tangerine, orange, nectarine and citrus zest. Cracker malt. Light. Nice citrus bitterness that lingers. Not too sweet. Real good."
Very well executed DIPA. This one flies under the radar but no longer for me. Side by side with the baby ducks and this holds its own and then some. Klaus!
Fresh growler filled 10/22/17 and drank 10/27/17
Sampling a cold growler filled at the brewery 5 days ago. The beer is poured into my snifter and is a slightly hazy golden color with a fluffy and frothy bleached white head of 3 cm foaming up. The head is fairly dense and fades slowly to a sturdy surface layer. I dont see any bubbles rising to the surface in the glass.
"Drank this one back to back with Super Super Naught, FBD, and Double FBD, so it had a lot of competition, but came out on top. Great IPA, and typical NEBCO goodness, but just a little too lean ... needs a little more New England attitude!"
Growler filled at brewery 12-15. Pours a light orange with minimal head. Very nice lacing. 
My favorite from NEBCo
"This is a beautiful orange-gold brew, fairly clear (translucent), with a strong white head with good retention."
"Hazy Amber with foamy white head, aroma is a soapy funk (not the glass...) but gives way to grapefruit and citrus. Taste is juicy, but not a fruit bomb. Great feel with plenty of hop bitterness - which for me, many New England IPAs are lacking. Perfect carbonation too"
"Not a bad DIPA by any means, but it's hard to stand out when your brewery also makes Fuzzy Baby Ducks and Coriolis. It is beautiful to look at though, and hopefully it tastes better fresh on tap over what I got from the growler pour."
"Growler was a low fill and over 2 weeks old by the time I got it. diacetyl on the initial taste but not so much on the nose. Nose has nice earthy hops, pine and grapefruit. It's growing on me slowly, alcohol is a bit aggressive. Overall a pretty nice DIPA."
Very thankful to a loyal and reliable trade partner for keeping me up to my eyeballs in NEBCO offerings! This one was a long time coming as it's not done very often...it didn't disappoint! Super super smooth for an 8% DIPA! Loved it!!!
"Pine and citrus hop flavors, about 50/50. Bitter on the finish, but not off-putting."
Pours a foggy golden straw color with a 1-finger creamy white head. The head dissipates into a nice film that rests gently on top of the beer. Leaves some splotchy lacing.
Very underrated beer from New England Brewing Company if you ask me. I'd put it ahead of G-Bot and Fuzzy Baby Ducks which is ranked much higher. Will make a special trip!
A: cloudy; deep gold in color; 1 finger ivory head that receded to a thin collar; very nice lacing;
"Fresh growler fill from NEBCO and poured into a Gandhi-Bot snifter (felt it was appropriate haha). Pours a dark orange/caramel color with slight amount of head and lacing. The smell is somewhat of a mixture of peach, mango, oranges and maybe some other citrus rinds. The taste follows suit with the blend of many tropical fruits. Carbonation is on point and the mouthfeel is medium. It is very drinkable for it being a IIPA. This one is definitely a ""sleeper"" beer from NEBCO; quite possibly my favorite offering from them. Overall, try to get some fresh from the brewery... you will not be disappointed! Cheers!"
"On tap and it tastes pretty fresh. Good looking copper and slightly hazy with a thick white head that quickly disappeared. Smells of tropical fruits and peach and a bit of piney hop resin. Taste is similar with a burst of sticky, prickly piney bitterness. Very solid beer and leaves a nice slick feeling and lingering bitterness. "
"L: Deep copper, almost amber, hues; slight haze and a generous white head"
A: Tangerine to caramel in color. Very clear with creamline head. Consistent carb leaves a session lasting film with some droopy lacing on the side. 
"Probably my favorite nebco ipa. Has tons of citrus flavors. Kind of a mix of peach, orange, and grapefruit. Very tasty but not a big fan of the bitter aftertaste."
32oz. pill bottle growler into a Heady Topper stemless snifter. 
appearance- Golden amber and a little cloudy. Pours a soapy one finger head.
Giddyup! Beautiful orangey-brownish color that is expected of an IIPA that's not of the recent NE-variety..
Grabbed two growlers of this yesterday and I was very happy I picked up two. 
"My first IIPA from NEBCO, and it did not disappoint. Pours a orange gold color, a bit cloudy with a nice white head. Lots of tropic fruit in the nose, oranges, pineapple. Taste follows the nose, loaded with tropic fruit but has a slight bitter taste in the finish. A great beer!"
Look = Hazy with a darker orange tint
"Drank on tap at J. Timothy's Taverne, Plainville, CT"
"Edit (02/20/2016): Had again last night at Prime 16 and this batch was remarkably better and hoppier. Upticks in the aroma and taste by 0.25 each, other variables unchanged."
"L - a crisp, clear, amber. Leaves a lovely glow on my hands as the light glimmers through the orange ball of NEBCO deliciousness. "
"Pours a hazy dark orange, head dissipates quickly into a thin layer and ring, beautiful lacing. smell is pungent as hell: grapefruit, oranges, soft tropical notes, and a pretty decent pine scent, almost no malt on the nose. taste is even more pungent than the smell, but follows the same general notes: grapefuit, oranges, peach, mango, slight pineapple, big pine, and almost ""mosaic-like"" earthiness at the end. great DIPA from the CT craft masters."
"Color is a somewhat cloudy orange, but nearly as cloudy of the now stereotypically NE IPA. Smell has a nice, enjoyable floral scent to it. The taste is all earthy hops with a slight bitterness to balance. The finish is a little too bitter for me, but still enjoyable. Another solid/good IPA from nebco."
"Just an awesome beer!! This is very well balanced, crisp, and refreshing. I just hope that @Mpontiakos and @TheBlueJerzzzz can someday get their hands on this amazing beer."
"A: Golden w/ light haze. Thick, creamy head. Splotchy lacing."
"L: Hazy gold straw color with a thick, pillowy off-white head. Speckled lacing follows the beer down the glass."
"This is probably the best batch i have ever tasted, i think the addition of mosaic is new. This beer is up there with FBD"
"They need to make more, it's a great beer!!"
Nectar of the Gods. NEBCO does it again...
mini review:
"On tap at New York Pizza. Pours a a hazy burnt amber color with a half inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is uber fruity. Tropical and citrus fruits. Orange, mango, pineapple papaya, grapefruit and a hint of lime. The taste is more of those tropical and citrus fruits. Lots of mango at first followed by guava and grapefruit. Light toasted malts towards the finish. Bitter grapefruit at the finish along with some more tropical notes. Pretty dry mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. A bit boozey. Overall, amazing."
"Between 2015 and 2016 this beer seems to have become slightly less hazy and slightly more boozy. I can't say I'm excited about either of those changes, but it hasn't made the beer less delicious. It's just different. Drinks more like a west coast IPA (minus the dank) than I recall from years past. Deep orange in color almost copper like. Grapefruit and pine in the nose along with a caramel sweetness that is more in the flavor than the aroma. Also get some past ripe pineapple if I search for it. Pretty well carbonated, thankfully preventing this beer from feeling too heavy on the palate. Hop bitterness is assertive, get a lot of citrus pith and essence of citrus oils on the sides of my tongue. I still wish NEBCo would brew this more often but I think it's always going to be a rotating release for them."
"A: hazy dark orange, nice lacing to boot, 1 finger head"
"Beautiful burnished gold and orange peel in the glass. Pungent. Nose is a lovely tropical blend of sticky papaya and guava that wafts out of the glass. The flavor is nicely sophisticated here, running from a sweet, mango fruit upfront to just enough malt to balance the massive hops here, to a dry, slightly bitter bite on the backend that cleans things up for the next sip. World class. Better than the Bot."
"I got a growler from the brewery in New Haven, Connecticut."
32oz growler into a Duvel tulip. Gigantic thanks to Matt and everyone else at NEBCO for making this incredible beer and getting it to me while fresh. Cheers guys!
"Filled on the release day, 7/9/14, drinking now (one week old - disclaimer: This blew my mind at the brewery, so I waited for my own hype to chill out before reviewing). Poured into the only appropriate glassware: The Gbot"
Poured from the expertly filled tap to the squealer on-premise at NEBCO taps.
"I'm going back and reviewing some of my favorite beers I've had since my previous ratings now mean nothing. Locust Reign is one of my top 3 favorite NEBCo beers. The other two being Coriolis and Fat Ten Er #2. I wish that one day I could compare all 3 side by side, but unfortunately, that tasting has only occurred in my dreams."
"This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style."
"Poured into a snifter. Very hazy bright yellow color with a modest white head. Big tropical, grassy, and earthy aroma. Taste followed: pineapple, berries, mango, grass, and dank flavors. Smooth, full-bodied, and soft bitterness. One of my favorite TIPAs."
"Amazing Triple IPA! Definitely one of the best I've ever drank! I was able to try this from a pretty old can, and even still it was hazy and super delicious. Very lucky to drink an all-time great!!"
Another awesome IPA from Hoof. 
"Drinking from a 16oz can into glass. I have a hunch that perhaps this can has been sitting around for a while as the aroma and taste is very muted and borderline stale (dare I say). Even still its a tasty big beer, with a surprisingly thin body for 11.5%. Not top shelf worthy, at least not the can I drank from."
"To me, this is about as close to a perfect beer. The best part is how hidden the alcohol is. Sure you can't crush a bunch of these but just one could be just enough. With it's limits, that makes perfect sense to me."
"Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice fluffy white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Lots of pineapple, mango, papaya and a hint of pine. Moderately bitter. Hides ABV extremely well. Huge tropical fruit flavor taste similar to aroma with some dank notes. Top notch imperial ipa."
Looks a cloudy off yellow color. Smells of sweet fruits. Tropical explosion in the mouth with a dank finish. Feels amazing!!!!!
"Hazy as all get out, and mango fruit punch for days - I've had a lot from Hoof Hearted, but this is by far their masterpiece. Good luck believing it's a Triple IPA too, because it drinks like a single! One of my new favorites."
The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color.
"Pours a hazy golden color with pure white head. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Flavor follows the nose with big notes of papaya, mango and citrus. Has a bit of bitterness on the back end with a clean citrus peel aftertaste. Has a nice drinkable body and overall very delicious."
From can. Pours a milky orange. Very impressive head for a trip/abv. Sticky lacing stays in place well. Minimal booze in the nose. Honeydew and grapefruit rind? Great smell anyhow. Very sweet to mask abv. Noticeable carb but an overall smooth finish. Nice and sticky. Solid beer.
"Poured from the can into a tulip. Huge beer, but pretty easy drinking considering the ABV. Tropical fruit, minimal bitterness, solid mouthfeel. Really solid triple IPA!"
L: standard TIPA color nothing special looking but very good looking
Surprisingly one of the better triple ipas out there. Not overly bitter and weedy/dank. 
"For me, I have experienced all of the hoof hearted beers I have wanted to sample. This.... this is the best by far. It is absolutely delicious with every sip you take. It has only gotten better with age. I can't really describe it too much. The aroma is pineapple, mango, peach, orange. The taste is straight juice with some hop bitterness. And the alcohol is covered so well that I can't even seem to distinguish where it begins and ends. It is one of the best examples of what this brewery can do and one of the best beers I have had all year. I truly love this beer and the 16.99 I paid for the four pack (x3 because I bought 3 total 4 packs) is well worth it. I think they have finally found there stride at hoof. I had roller blabe and didn't enjoy it till I waited 5 weeks post batch. South of Eleven was excellent. I really liked Konkey Dong. And this beer... this beer is truly why I drink the style. I just absolutely love it! I hope they can brew it more then once a year, but if that is the case... I will be back next year! Great job Hoof. You have finally made me want to consistently go to every release!"
fresh can drank on 11/5/2016
1 PINT can
L: Pours a dark gold with a nice head that stays around a bit.
"First beer I've given a 5 across the board..best IPA I've had to date, this is a deceptive beer it drinks like a TH double IPA but is so slam packed with fruity hops and more hazy..oh yeah and it's 11.5%, I've never tried a beer that hides it's booze content this well, a hazy delight."
"L - not so sure about this label. Muscular humanoid topless dragon with a classic male stripper bow tie... and that's it. But then he's got a guitar in one hand and a wizard RPG character riding him. I have no idea. Pours a neon radioactive grassy orange green right out of the can. Damn! Murky, swampy... the color of dragon scales?"
This is an absolute dream to drink. 11.5% ABV that is completely hidden. Huge burst of tropical fruit with the perfect amount of pine. Seak out if you can. World class IIIPA
"Tried it from the can and also poured into a snifter for review purposes. Really really cloudy beer, dirty yellow with almost a brownish tint. Very healthy lacing, but I can't tell how active the carbonation is because it is so cloudy. A gigantic juicy hop bomb on the nose. I could just keep smelling this thing if it didn't taste so damn good as well. Big juicy hop characteristics for the taste. It doesn't present much in the way of bitterness, maybe just a little at the end, but it's very citrusy with a slight sharp zesty tanginess that hits the center of the tongue. For a beer that is almost 12%, the alcohol is hidden rather well. This is a really outstanding beer."
"L: Hazy, dark OJ hues with an ample white fluffy head"
"Poured fresh into WW IPA glass. Opaque and orange with thin white head. Smell of tropical fruit, pineapple and tangerines hits the nose from 5 feet away. Taste follows with intense orange, tangerine, pineapple layered with each sip. Not boozy with perfect moderate carb and full but not oily mouthfeel. A+"
"Peach-orange puree, opaque as hell, almost darkening to tan, with a thin, dense white blanket leaving a fine film."
Loved his juicy hop bomb that even looked like OJ when poured! Had a few good hearted varieties now and they are all excellent! Looking for great things from HH!!
Look - Golden orange type color. Very slight haze most mostly clear in appearance. 
Poured from a 12 oz. can into a Belgian tulip.
Can.
"Powerfully strong on the alcohol side for an IPA and with a residual sweetness that tames the spice nearly perfect, Hoof Hearted's ""triple IPA"" rips out of the can kicking and screaming."
this one pummeled me.
"Dragonsaddle is only moderately hazed, giving a unique look in the 3 HH cans sampled today, a bit darker than its counterparts with a hue that goes just beyond amber. The head is a tall, frothy one with great hold and stick. Not only does the pillow stand for a good while, but lacing coats the glass very nicely as the beer drops as well."
"Poured out as a nice looking orange color with a decent white head on top. The smell of the beer is heavily hopped, lots of pine and tropical fruit notes here. The taste of the beer is balanced really well with the big malt bill and even more hops to cut right through. The feel is smooth. Overall a very solid Triple IPA."
Many thanks to WesMantooth for this amazing beer!
"Description: Clear and golden in color with just a bit of white head. The smell is initially a big blast of citrus fruit with some dank, pine and resin underneath. Taste is similar with pineapple, mango and a sweet, fruity taste up front. The finish has just enough bitterness to provide a good balance to the beer and leave a pleasant, slightly bitter aftertaste: alcohol is almost completely absent which is quite an accomplishment for an 11%+ ABV beer. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth with just a little carbonation."
"super easy drinking TIPA, almost can't believe it as it's not nearly as malty as most ""trips"" ive had..this is top notch stuff"
I'm not sure how many beers I've given 5 across the board but this one deserves it. 
Really great beer. Hop profile does an astonishingly good job of masking the alcohol. Not overwhelmingly bitter or hot like I find in many higher alcohol ipa's. I still prefer musk but would trade for it again
Pours out a golden orange and more clear than most other Hoof Hearted IPAs.
Recommended by the bier cellar in Maine
"Pours like pineapple juice. Looks like pineapple juice. Much more east coast than last year (in my opinion, a good thing). Alcohol is well hidden for 11.5%. Great beer."
Thank you SomethingClever for this
12 oz can poured into snifter canned on 11/15
"12oz can from recent release (11/15/2015), thanks Ryan!"
This. Beer. Kills.
"Canned November 15, 2015 enjoyed November 16, 2015 in a Mad Elf tulip/snifter."
My favorite TIPA ever. Completely hides the 11.2 abv.
"Absolutely blown away that this is considered a ""triple ipa."" "
"If they could make enough of this, it would be the new 'it' ipa. Move over heady topper"
"Smooth, danky, mango, pineapple, grapefruit juiciness. Fresh pine and flowers with a little bit of funk on the back end. Dangerously easy to slug (barely detect any of the 11.2% abv). Has everything you could want in a DIPA. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever tasted."
"One of the best of the style I've ever had, dangerously drinkable for the 11%+ abv, and without the malt bomb flavor that many other TIPA's have. Very comparable to All Green Everything and the clean hop aroma and taste come through almost as well Boneyard's Notorious."
"Pours a murky yellow with no foam or head on the top. Aroma is huge citrusy orange with a tangy twist. Oats and biscuit malts firm up the background of the aroma. Flavor profile offers a little more diversity, hitting notes of orange, papaya, and mango. It still carries a tangy flavor. Biscuity, oat malts offer a little ground for the hops to plant their feet. Mouth feel is fuzzy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, a very good, citrusy IPA. Nice focus on one hop. "
Pours a hazy golden orange with two fingers of white head.
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
"Beautiful and hazy. Smells like ripe oranges. Taste and mouth feel are wonderfully well-balanced - sweet, but not overly so. I kept thinking of Julius as I drank this, but it was without a doubt better than any batch of Julius that I've ever had. It finishes cleaner and has just the perfect mouth feel consistency."
"Head production is poor (but not non-existent); an increasingly turbulent pour - eventually just dumping in the last 1/3 of the can into an imperial pint-sized glass - resulted in perhaps one finger of white head. What did form, however, had good retention. The body itself is a peachy-orange color, pulpy and completely opaque, with some sediment visible during the pour."
"Holy handgrenade, that's smooth."
"Lot of great things going on here. Beautiful, hazy grapefruit in the glass, lovely citrus aroma, and a lightness that comes with oats. Then smoothed out by a little lactose and you have a creamy juicebomb that is flat out delightful!"
"Less than one week old, Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a pleasant smooth citrus. Taste is also a very pleasant citrus taste that is very smooth."
Thank you CanConPhilly for this
Canned 7/19/18 (15 days ago)
Decanted for a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/19/2018 and purchased at the brewery today.
"4.06/5: One hell of a Citra-laden nose, but a bit too sweet on the palate; still very approachable and enjoyable"
This beer is super hazy and pours a like straight juice. Very thin head. Maybe 1 finger high. Surprised that the double dry hop didn’t slap me in the face. The smell is fairly underwhelming. Not much to write about. Tastes like pineapple juice. Very tasty. The carbonation is definitely lacking big time. Drinks very thin for a DIPA. This beer was canned 06/22/18 so it’s not old. Lacks that little zip to push it to a 4.5 for me. I give it a 4.3
"This beer pours a super cloudy and completely opaque dark golden yellow color with a one finger, creamy, off white head. Retention is excellent and there are many sticky patches of lacing left all over the glass."
"Pours a milky medium yellow with a half inch head that settled to a ring quickly and left little blotchy lacing. Smells of citrus fruits, apricots, some grass and pepper. Tastes like an orange creamsicle with additional flavors of lemon, apricot, orange rind, oats, pepper and and earthy background. Creamy mouth feel, medium bodied, lightly carbonated, mild bitterness."
"Canned on 1/10/18; drank on 2/18/18; my second OH beer ever and although it is 5 weeks old, this beer is ridiculous; I honestly believe that OH does not get the hype and recognition it deserves based on my limited experience; incredible citrus aroma and flavor"
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Pale straw in color, completely turbid with a modest white head that settles into a thin lacing. Lots of citra in the nose with a bit some lemon & peach notes. Lots of citrus and more peach-like hop notes, a bit of malt sweetness near the end. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. 8.5% abv is extremely well hidden. Very nice."
"densely yellow in color..smell is pine and grass, with some tart citrus on the back end..taste almost follows suit..a bit more bitter than I was expecting, but it doesn't distract from how good this is...it drinks lighter than most 8.5% IPA's..which means having multiples at once is not an arm twister"
Poured from a growler into a teku glass.
"This one pours a light hazy orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"On tap at Other Half. Pours an opaque, of course, pale orange with a thin layer of head. Some lacing. The nose is tangerine, berries, lemon, grapefruit and some light floral notes. Taste mirrors the aroma but with some melon and pineapple. Tangerine, grapefruit and some lightly toasted malts at the end. Medium body with low carbonation and a mild alcohol presence. Worth seeking out."
"This was yet another Other Half beer that I picked up at the brewery when it was released. I loved the previous incarnations of the Daydream beers and this continued the legacy that those left as it was quite juicy, creamy, and softer than I would have been led t believe!"
Amazing beer. Dank and thick and chewy.
"Finger plus head of basic white foam with an even surface that displays below average retention, the lacing initially forms broad streaks but has minimal stickiness. The liquid literally looks like orange juice, it’s not cloudy nor hazy, it’s pulped, a completely opaque yellowish color, every now and then you see a bubble rising up against the glass sides. Peppery nose, straw and hay, tar, plenty of white grapefruit zest, while green and herbaceous not really that dank, not all that floral, however, you get a consistent blast of papaya, pineapple, nectarine to star fruit scents, the textural muskiness lingers well. In the mouth it’s full-bodied and dense and also feels like pulped juice, albeit with a subtle underlying carbonation. A bit more pine to flowers on offer, the white grapefruit supplemented by tangerine tones. Caramel and honeyed bread help fend off bitterness. Again, the hops are clean and bright and without much residual dankness. The mango, papaya, pineapple fruit tends to crest just through the mid-palate and mostly gone by the finish. High degree of drinkability given the ABV and no arch dryness through the end."
"Just a phenomenal beer, one of the most impressive from this brewery to date. Cloudy orange juice murk with patchy lacing clinging to the glass, bursting with citra aroma. Smells unbelievably juicy and the flavor mostly follows suit, with tons of tropical fruit character, restrained bitterness, and a underlying dank note that balances things out perfectly. Fluffy medium full body but still lively in feel, not excessively creamy or soft. Wish I had more than just a few cans, I could drink this by the case. Perfect expression of the citra hop."
Popped side by side with Citra daydream oat cream and double dry hopped double mosaic daydream. can courtesy of my man robbie from earlier today.
"Pours a dark muddy golden. Not that great looking. Not terribly aromatic either. Some citrus rind on the nose. It's more citrus forward than tropical, unfortunately. It's soft, but the body is a little heavy. I get wary with the lupulin powder IPAs but there's no burn or aftertaste. It's solid."
"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma is juicy, fruity and dank. Taste is juicy with milky yeast and low bitterness. Full bodied and smooth on the palate."
16 oz. can dated 08/17/17
16oz can poured into a Brew Gentlemen teku glass:
"pours out a hazed golden orange color with bright white head that is dense and creamy and hangs around, great lacing. this one is aromatic and absolutely delicious - love how the sharp critic and pithy green hop notes play beautifully with softer tropical and sugary bready qualities from the added fermentables!! reminds me of like peach rings and starburst or something but its also balanced by the bready and oat character, as well as some hoppy green quality - this one brings huge creamy peaches, candied orange, doughy malts, creamy almost vanilla like character, some OH danky and pine, green to an extent but overall fucking candied tropical milkshake status. mouthfeel has some great texture to it, awesome awesome stuff!"
Canned on Aug/09.
"Can. From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Really strong frutality and bitterness, with some milkshake ipa reminiscences. Good but didnt live up the hype, as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass"
This is a great NEIPA. Departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer. I appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off.
Two day old growlette poured into a tulip glass. 
Currently #185 in the Top 250 beers list. My first Trillium beer...I'm rather excited.
"When I first cracked this, it was the first beer from Trillium that I had ever had. I have now come to think that Trillium is second in New England only to Hill Farmstead."
Crisp and clean but with some floaters too! Nice tropical fruits up front give way to a solid bit of hoppy bitterness on the end. Refreshing and satisfying double here that doesnt taste like a double.
"Delicious. Smooth with tons of flavor. Fruity, hazy, with a great finish. Definitely not overdone with the alcohol content like some double IPAs have. To be honest surprised it’s a double IPA almost to smooth to be a double."
"Pours a golden peach with a fluffy fast dissipating head. Aroma is big on mango and pineapple with a piney crackery malt note. Flavor is tropical fruits, slightly bitter hops, and a soft malt backbone. Goes down smoothly with a crisp finish. A well crafted DIPA."
Appearance: Arrives cloudy and goldenstraw colored with a frothy but modest head; decent retention and some clumps of lacing hang around
"Pours Golden yellow, frothy head of foam and thin lace on the glass."
"This is an amazing beer! Could be the best I've had.. If this beer is not to your liking, than clearly you do not like NE style ipa period. Amazingly well crafted, and balanced. Honestly amaze balls!"
Superb. This has the juicy flavors that I felt Scaled Way Up lacked ever so slightly. Fun to drink. Delicious.
Canned 2/06/18. Consumed on 2/22/2018.
"The citrusy, tropical, floral notes in this one makes for one of the best mouth feels in a DIPA that ive had. The balance between the sweetness from the malt bill and the hops combo is great. Galaxy, Citra and Colombus hops makes this extra juicy with a perfect thick haze."
Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.

Serving: Can
Look- Hazy golden straw. Slight tinge of translucency
Pint can. Canned on 11/20/17. Opened on 12/6/17
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 10/16/17. 
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (two weeks old). Appearance is hazy yellow/brown with one finger thick head (decent retention). Smell is earthy hops, grapefruit pith, fermented sugar, wheat. It doesn't jump out at you, but the floral hops are pleasant."
Another freekin’ great brew from Trillium. Must be disgusting for Trillium to make great beer brew after brew all the time
"Thick rich head which requires several press to fill the glass with ""only"" a two finger head. The liquid is cloudy with a whitish gold color. Interesting lace as it covers the gambit of possibilities -- streaks, rings, and spots. "
Trillium doesn't disappoint. 16oz can poured into a tulip. $20 for 4pack at the brewery.
"Pours an opaque orange color with a fairly well retained half inch white head that left little lacing. Smells of strong tropical fruits followed by a little citrus fruits and a hint of spice. Tastes of honeydew melon, pineapple, mango, sweet grapes, grapefruit, slight spices and sweet malts on the finish. Medium to full bodied, light carbonation, moderate bitterness that quickly disappears, slightly dry finish."
"160z can purchased at the Canton brewery dated 10/16/17. Hazy orange color and a citrusy nose is followed by complex very fruity flavors that may include honeydew melon, apricot, mango, pineapple and some slight grapefruit on the finish to dry it out. This beer is very smooth and flavorful and one of our Trillium favorites."
Poured to a tulip from a can dated 9/22.
"From a 3-day-old can, pours a hazy, milky-looking orange-gold. Very little head or lacing. Smell and taste are a huge dank bomb, along with white grape juice, tropical fruit and earthy notes. Feel is on the lighter side. Wonderful stuff."
Growler picked up from the brewery yesterday.
"From a can dated 9/22/17. This is my favorite trillium beer and may be one of my favorite DIPAs, period! Smell is of sweet tropical fruit and gummy bears. Look is a hazy orange and it tastes like straight grape juice with a bitter bite. Overall this beer is a gem...wish I got more than two 4-pks."
Pours a muted opaque yellow with a foamy white head. Decent retention and lacing.
"Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Hazy golden color, white head dissipated quick, looks like typical NE ipa hop juice. Smell is extremely tropical citrus, hit me the instant I opened the can. Taste followed briefly but was more bitter than expected. It felt more west coast and had an underlying spice. Overall it's a good brew to try on tap but not one I'd purchase more cans of."
"16 oz can. 4 weeks old. A flatl and opaque orange body that had an inch and half of head after being poured into a teku, decent lacing and a nice ring of foam as the head settled. A little muted nose but there is still plenty of citrus notes, sweet tropical fruits as well. Very bitter throughout, this seems more of a west coast style to me. It smoothed out a touch as it warmed but not much. Above average carbonation and a dry, bitter aftertaste. Not a homer in my book. Have one more can so may edit it if there happens to be a noticeable difference."
"Pours cloudy orange like a haze after an eruption of flavor. Great foamy head and lacing, very pretty beer. Smells of light sweet floral, citrus, pine, and a slight bitters note. Taste follows the nose, very light sweet flavors blended with a zip of citrus and minor bitter tone. Very smooth beer but again like the other Trillium beers so complex and amazing, this is a light to medium beer but in a class of its own."
"Great, awesome pineapple/OJ color with a glorious head of 2 fingers in my Deschutes pilsner glass. "
"A -Pours a hazy, opaque golden tan color with thick, frothy white lacing, little to no carbonation. "
"Just reviewed Congress Street, which I gave a 4.0. I like this brew a bit better. It is slightly more carbonated, and the mango is not as overwhelming. Bought @ Trillium Brewery, canned on date 8/21/17"
Canned on 8/21
"Tasted from can. Pours a super murky orange with white head. Aroma is tangerine, mango, passion fruit. Taste is well balanced. Flavors of mango, peach, tangerine, papaya, crackers. Incredibly well done IPA."
From a 16oz can purchased at the brewery about 3 weeks ago
"Canned 4/12/16; pours golden straw in color, turbid with a white head that settles into a very thin lacing. Tropical hop aroma. Flavors of melon and citrus with a slightly dry finish. Another great DIPA from trillium"
"Marvelously crushable double IPA. Hop aroma wafts across the room. Orange citrus, good mouthfeel for DIPA. Very well crafted. Thanks Joe for hooking me up."
16 oz can poured into pint glass canned on 5/22
"This beer looked like pulpy, freshly-squeezed orange juice. There was a halo of white head."
"P- Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City pint glass. Canned on 22-MAY-2017"
A: cloudy; pale gold in color; less than a 1 finger white head that receded quickly to a thin collar; no lacing;
Poured 6 weeks after brewing into a snifter. Thanks to crubbsy for the trade!
"I love this beer from Trillium. The notes on this have a great grapefruit scent, but the taste of the fruit is subtle enough to simply enhance the happiness of this IPA."
Milky yellow with white foam. 
"Canned 04/12/17, it pours (you guessed it) cloudy gold orange color with a foamy 2 finger off white head that was full of bubbles, fading very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing. The second can of the night left much better lacing and a foamy layer on top. Classic New England IPA looks."
"Pours a hazy turbid straw yellow. Nose is of fresh citrus and light pine. Taste of very faint citrus, grapefruit and dough malts AND then the dreaded onion bomb takes over. Every once and awhile I come across one of these bright hoppy IPAs that I just can't get over the oniony taste this is one of them! The Only Trillium to date that I get it from. It was a decent beer in all other aspects. Medium body that finished dry."
5 oz pour at Trillium 4/7/17.
"L: Cloudy and hazy light colored pineapple juice, little bubbly at first."
"On-tap 4/1/2017 at the brewery in Canton, MA, served in a tulip glass."
Can pour into std pint glass. Nice opaque light orange color with nice head. Head dissipates but beer leaves heavy sticky lacing all the way down. Aroma is very citrusy with a little sharp dank mango in the back. Taste is amazing with citrus and tropical fruits dancing with the malt. Enough finishing bitterness to refresh the palate and leaving you anticipating the next taste. I do like it
Can received in trade with ian.
Pours a hazy golden 
"Damn this is good. You just can't get tired of all those Trillium D/IPAs. This one features Galaxy, Citra, and Columbus hops. Has the expected appearance of opaque juice, like pineapple or grapefruit juice, that is. Aromas of tropical citrus are followed by a splash of fresh juice with lots of orange, brighter moments of something vaguely lemony, and a finer thread of something akin to wine grapes. Tingly, bright, zesty, tangy - medium-light feel, the hum of carbonation - another killer beer for sure."
Tall can...1/25/17
A: opaque light yellow OJ. thin bright white head
"Hazy gold brew with lots of clumps of yeast in the glass. Has a sticky white head that leaves a few gobs of lacing. The aroma is grapefruit and onions with some malty sweetness. The taste is sweet and fruity with a piney and pithy finish. This isn't pretty looking, even for a hazy beer, but it tastes pretty damn good."
Can from the brewery in Boston
Close to Bissell Brothers Reciprocal but not quite there.
Poured from a 16oz can into my Stella Artois chalice (it was clean!) Looks like cloudy juicy goodness. It almost glows.
Pours a hazy bright orange color. Lots of
"16 oz can into pint glass, dated 1/25/17"
"Reviewing cans both 1 day old and 1 week old. Hazy and light in appearance. Aroma is somewhat muted, but I do get some generic citrus notes plus a touch of melon. Somewhat dank. Flavor completely lacks malt character. Hops are citrusy (lemon, orange, and a little lime) but not strong at all, kinda spritzy and thin. Mouth feel is too close to seltzer...refreshing but too thin for a DIPA. Overall it drinks like a session IPA. For a DIPA I want some thing that doesn't taste like its 4.5% and it needs some malt character. Not a bad beer, just not good for the DIPA style."
Most Trilliums are really great. This one is just too boozy to my state. Trillium has mastered the art of blending grapes/grape juice/grape aroma into the beer and this one is no exception.
"First had 1/1/17 at home from Andy K. Traded for this beer, because who passes the chance at a trillium? Lemon, bitter, grassy, all in flavor and nose. Again the luscious trillium mouth feel for the win."
Canned 09-07-16. Drank 09-16-16.
Poured into a Trillium tulip glass.
Yet another excellent brew from Trillium. Had it at a share and it blew me away. Great aromas out of the glass of fruit and a little dankness as well. Those same flavors were great on the palate as well
"Pours a bright orange with a bit of haze, bubbly at first but dies down to a small head. Aroma is huge tropical fruit, orange peel, citrus, and sweet hop zest.  Taste is huge tropical fruit and citrus, soft sweet light malts, and a hint of orange peel bitter to finish, with a bit of booze heat. Feel is soft and wheat-cloudy. Great beer."
22oz bottle poured into a tulip
A pounder can into a tulip appears hazy golden with yeast chunks in suspension and white head that fades leaving patchy lace.
First sip or two catches you off guard. Smooths out a few sips in then becomes very good. Bros are high on their rating this one. Try again guys.
"This is a decent double IPA from Trillium, but not the best. It has the look of all of their lightly hazy doubles, and it is a decent beer. The smell to me is like ocean water, but I can't tell if thats because there's oysters on the label or if its reality! It taste decent, its hoppy and tangy, maybe tangerine. Mouthfeel is pretty standard, fairly dry finish. Overall a decent double, but I would take uppercase over it anyway. not to mention a few other of their DDH streets."
Great hop forward IPA from Trillium. Carbonation is nice and light. Hops come through so strong and crisp. Nice clear golden color coming through. Poured a nice strong head. Great citrusy notes on the hop smell.
"Pours out that classic Trillium haze for daze, but a slightly lighter orange this time."
"Pours yellow and super merky with a nice white head that fades quickly. Light lacing. Aroma is pineapple, citrus,oranges, pine and hops. Taste. Citrus, pineapple, orange,pine needles ,hops. I really enjoyed this one. Second one from trillium had scaled up first. This is a lot better imo. A lot of flavor nice and juicy."
Appearance - pours cloudy yellow quite a few floaties in the glass nice thick white head excellent lacing.
"Pours straw with lots if floaties. Nose is tropical fruits but not common ones, lychee, a little crackery. Taste is very interesting, fruit juice, cracker, maybe some lemon juice on the finish. Thinner mouthfeel and body. Low bitterness. Very good and interesting beer"
Trillium Vicinity
"Very similar in color to a lot of Trilliums's pales and IPAs, that murky golden color with a little bit of head. Nose is citrusy, and a hint of something sweet that I can't put my finger on, but gun to my head I would say orange juice. Juice bomb taste with bitterness at the end. Good carbonation, and another very solid beer from Trillium."
16oz undated can (ink smudged)
"Pours clear, light gold in color, with 3/4 inch head. Taste is honey, mango, papaya, and light wet hops. Light, creamy, and sweet with low bitterness. Subtle flavors that make up a delightful drink. There is juice there, but it does not hit you over the head like other Trillium or Tree House brews. Quality brew that I am glad I got a four pack of."
"My go to DIPA from Trillium. So drinkable and delicious. Always looking forward to getting my hands on it. Is it worth the price? For me, sure."
"Growler purchased today..First thing is the smell. Smells like a big bowl of good weed. Dank would be a more accepted word here than ""skunky"". Moving on..The taste is a juicy punch. Smooth. Refreshing. 8% ABV...no where to be found."
"One of my favorites so far from Trillium. Great smell, taste, look. All around great dIPA. Love that they're producing in cans now. Even better."
Golden yellow. White head with lace.
not as bitter as i would like to see from an imperial IPA. it poured a hazy golden orange with a white head. the notes where dank and earthy with flavors of grapes and other sweet fruits.
"Poured 16oz can into snifter. It is a dark cloudy yellow with a 2 finger white head and a bit of lacing. Aroma is hop laden with the mix of galaxy and citrus. A good amount of tangerine, passion fruit, grapefruit, and some sweet pineapple. Flavor is spot on with the nose and very juicy. Malt is light and blends well with tropical and citrus hop flavors. Feel is medium with some spritzy carbonation and a mild dry finish. Simply tremendous."
"maybe the best of the three sent from the east. when melons turn to liquid and in hop form, that can make one think, ponder the limey ethos of ethereal permanence, funny how that works. a hop here, a hop there, skip a little filtration and then double down, make it stick, yeah. maybe you have a yacht? a boat only floats on high gravity ale yeast right? make it soupy, thick, realllllllllll thick. pay the price of new brewery taxation, fill in the grooves, bend, even break, whatever, do what you need to do to play it cool, its harder than it looks. beer like this shines, squirts hops (yee haw!), inks, tattoos, blacks out, something you should try, its fully fun. yeah baby, all good. hop it up. refinement be damned, who cares?! its not about that, its about a shine, a luster, a dry hopping nobody else can quite pull off in this way. nothing negative at all here, just an unexpected realization that quality is imperative and these dudes do it best. a diamond mine, a bastard child, mesmerizing euphoric bliss. all in a real remarkable ipa. ya learn something new every day!"
"Poured can dated 8/24/16 into a large snifter and was walloped by a wonderful spicy tropical aroma. Beautiful pale orange with a apple cider haze. Nectarine and mango notes lead the charge for me. Dry finish. Up there with the best and another intense New England IPA. For my money, I will take the NE ipa entries over all others."
Canned date of 07/12/16
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 9/7/16 canning date. 
A: Pours a super hazy honey/tangerine color. Super murky with a thin bone white head.
"Smell is mango, hint of pine, pineapple, and a hint of passionfruit. Taste is orange citrus, mango, hint of guava, with light floral bitterness on the finish. Having had this fresh, I'm surprised at how well this has held up (just about 3 months old). Still very juicy and an excellent beer."
"Poured from a chilled can into a tulip glass. Not sure how old the beer was, I received it as a gift a week earlier and I don't know how long ago Trillium had it available."
"L - more of that delightful OJ haze. A bit darker this time around. Bit of murk, bit of turb. Surprised by how coarse the head bubbles were. This screams overcarbonated, but let's see..."
Took a beer run from northern NJ to Trillium with a quick stop at Treehouse on the way back. If you're from my area I highly recommend the trip - it was so worth it. This was another stunning brew from Trillium. Not much of an aroma but that's not as important to me as taste and feel which this brew has. Wonderfully smooth and drinkable. Its almost dangerous how easy this drinks with this high a ABV level. Not the best I've had but a stellar brew. Will def do another MASS beer run in the future.
"L - hazy yellow with a fair amount of particulets, thin white head"
"Bright cloudy orange with a moderate, white fluffy head."
16 oz tallboy can. 
"A - drinking from the can, I'm giving this one a 4.5 because the cans awesome. I'm sure if you pour it, you get to see it in all of its hazy glory but I just don't feel like pouring into a glass right now. "
Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for the hookup
"16 oz can. Hazy bright orange. Small white head that settles to a thin collar. Smells of tropical fruit with just a hint of grapefruit pungency. Tastes again of tropical fruit, but with some tangerine. Lightly sweet. Grapefruit hop finish with low bitterness. Medium body. Very easy to drink. Not at all heavy or sweet. Very impressive."
"Had this on 2016-08-01 in Columbia, PA from a 16 oz can not yet 3 weeks old"
"Ooooo this one was good. Citra and Galaxy hops all over the place rocketing this toward one of my favorite Trilliums. I'll be at the brewery next week, and I really hope they have this one available so I can have again."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, straw-caramel coloring with a low profile, clingy, white head. Aromas of dried grass, berries, lemon zest, grapefruit, melon, and subtle pine resin. Very balanced aromas. Flavors are tropical fruit sweet and tangy forward, with notes of papaya, mango, melon, guava, and passion fruit, with a balance of dried grass, piney notes, and a cracker and toasted backbone. The body is full and crisp at the same time, with a dryness in the backbone. Aftertaste of tart and sweet tropical fruit notes, with a more subtle herbal and grassy hops character. The finish is smooth, dry, and with a fruity linger. Great beer."
"Very hazy bright orange body with a fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is big on citrus; clementines and tangerines, hints of sweet melon and fresh grass. Flavor is bitter with a lot of citrus zest flavor, hints of sweet hard candy. Feel is slick, medium-high carbonation, full bodied. Overall another nice hoppy beer from trillium, but I like the pale ales and IPAs a little better."
Reminded me so much of Lambo door from Grimm. Has the same juicy characteristics.
L: hazy with straw/golden hue
"Poured from a can (canned 7/12) on 7/12 into a snifter. Hazy beautiful pour, medium-large head that quickly dissipates on a moderately aggressive pour, smells similar to Trillium's Congress St. IPA, peaches mangos etc., with slight boozy and metallic hints, tastes like a less fruity Congress St. with more of a bitter piney afterbite, feel is crisp but almost watery which is surprising given the clear hop presence. Overall this was everything I expect from Trillium's hoppy beers -juicy and delicious! I completely and respectfully disagree with the ""bros"" rating. Ironically, the staff published on rating beers specifically advising against rating beer that was sampled at a tap as factors such as noise, setting, etc. might influence the perception. Further, tapping a keg at row 34 or anywhere else does not guarantee freshness or consistency across sampling. Grab a something packaged and be consistent in my humble opinion or don't bother reporting because it is useless."
"750ml bottle, 06.14.16, tagged on the back, poured into a Trillium snifter glass. "
"Big Trillium fan here, but I find that many of their IPA's start to blur together with the underlying dankness taking center stage (many other breweries are guilty of this as well). Vicinity is probably the most unique IPA I've had from them. The citrus notes really shine through on this one. And while the dankness is there, it enhances the other flavors, rather than distracting from them. Many of their other IPA's seem to drop off after a few weeks, this one seems to hold up rather well."
"Cloudy and orange, has an orange juice look to it. The smell is juicy, what I've come to expect from a NE IPA, I smelled some grapefruit in there, and maybe some peach. Flavorwise, it's kind of sweet, again, very juicy, as one would expect, and not piney. Honestly, it reminds me of a sweeter, more tropical brass monkey. (I consider this to be a good thing.) Pretty solid DIPA offering from Trillium, but not my favorite of theirs."
"yellowish/orange with a white head, y'know. cloudy."
"appearance is what youd expect from a trillium IPA, basically looks like orange juice with a tight and thin white head that leaves a rim around the glass. "
Bro's! Y'all on crack!
"Poured into a snifter. Just about the cloudiest double IPA I've ever had. Healthy foam and lacing, but it's so cloudy I can't tell how healthy the carb is. Big bitter hop nose that follows through on the taste. On both smell and taste, there's slight citrus and malt notes underneath everything. Very light for such a hoppy beer-not much alcohol present. Just a fantastic beer."
Mermaid Notes:
"Bottle shared by Mike the other night, thanks man."
Bottled 4/29/16
"Newer batch is drinking just right. Great stuff. Melon, pineapple, light bitterness, sweetness from the malts. Nice beer."
"I stopped into the Fort Point location to get some Secret Stair, and they didn't have any. After describing what I generally like (strong ales - Double, triple, quad generally Belgian in style and Stouts) not overly bitter and hoppy. I have had some Double IPA's that I really like Six Point Resin, and my local Sip of Sunshine by Lawson's - Heady is just a little much for me. This Double IPA sounded great, but just didn't hit the mark."
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Label says 04/28/16.
Bottled 4/29/2016. More IPAs!!!
Smells Awesome!
"Definitely one of my favorite Trillium brews. Tastes like a clone of Heady Topper, but way more available for this BA in Ma. The fact that I can buy almost as much as I want of this stuff makes me very happy."
"Apr 29 2016 bottle, opened on a metal door handle in a hotel room on May 4 2016"
"Pretty bad-ass brew here. I'd say it's several shades higher than ""ok"", lol. Nose is enchanting, lots of citrusy hops, gin aromas, boozy orange juice. Damn! Love it. Taste is super smooth, lovely all-encompassing hop flavor washes over your tongue, similar to what Heady does but not quite at that level. Citrus flavors play on balanced hops and malts. Feel is smooth as silk. Overall: terrific!"
"typical Trillium.... juicy, hazy, delicious.... delicious.... 8% and yet so delicious..... am i at 150 characters yet? delicious. that's all there is to it. gawd, i love this stuff."
"For those of you looking for that super juicy, tropical IPA - here it is. Loads of mango and grapefruit smack you in the face leaving a definite sweetness. Not exactly my cup of tea, but I see why the love. Also, hate the super turbid appearance."
"In a single word, ""exquisite."""
"pours a murky murky light orange yellow, almost peach colored. beautiful trillium head that dissipates quick but leaves lacing. smell is big orange and pineapple, no malt on the nose. taste is the above orange and pineapple times 3, add some citrus and the slightest sweet juicy mango at the end. still not really picking up malt on the tongue, but that's how I like my pales: hop juice. mouthfeel is that juicy velvet that Trillium has on lock. kick ass DIPA, wouldn't expect any less from these guys. lol @ that bro rating."
Bomber drank in a Trillium chalice on 3/13/16
"Poured into a tulip glass. Thanks, Shannon."
"Hazy, honey color with half finger head that dissipates and leaves wisps of foam and lacing. Nose is pineapple, orange, passion fruit, and pine. Taste follows the nose. Tropical fruit, citrus, grape, and some melon on the front end with an earthy, mineral finish. The mouth feel is creamy and full for an IPA with low carbonation. It's extremely drinkable. One of the best IPAs."
"Nose is bursting with tropical fruit aromas: peach, mango, pineapple. Light honey sweetness. "
750ml bottle dated 03/07/16
"Pours a light orange color with thick white lacy head. Nose of mango, citrus, and other tropical fruits. juicy up front with a perfect amount of dry bitterness at the end. Overall great beer from trillium!"
"750ml bomber thanks to BabyTree. Orange color, extremely hazy, decent head. Aroma is fruity, citrus, pine. Flavor is all of those and some ethanol. Overall a delicious IPA but I think I prefer Trillium' single IPA's to their doubles, the alcohol is less present."
750ml poured into tulip. 2/18/16
Ben!!! What a night.
"I finished a bomber in like 2 seconds... What an easily quaffable DIPA..possibly the easiest drinking I've had...heavy notes of melon, pepper and orange... Definitely one of their 3 best"
"This is one of the more crushable double IPA's I have had. As expected the nose is absolutely incredible. So much fruitiness from the hops, and a nicely carbonated body with good lacing."
"Big tropical fruit with just enough malt backbone to carry the hops. Peach and juicy tangerine, and it's hazy but not astringent. There's also a high floral note before the juice kicks in."
"I personally preferred this to artaic, but I dig the heavy tropical fruit and sappy pine over the garlicky, onion, marijuana of the Artaic. This was a fantastic DIPA and dangerously drinkable."
Not sure how the Bros rate this so low...this competes with many of HF's juicy IPA's. The best beer I've had from Trillium and that is saying a lot!
"Pours a deep orange. Opaque, but not what I would call murky. Head dissipated pretty quickly. I get a ton of oranges in the aroma. There is intense citrus and some resinous bitterness, but it isn't at all harsh. A bit of minerality. I feel like I remember this having more sweetness in the past. Some more tropical fruit. White grapes. The body is nice. The galaxy hops are certainly countered well to prevent harshness. An awesome DIPA."
Poured from the bottle into a stemmed tulip.
Consumed about a week and a half after purchasing in Canton. Poured into a teku glass.
"This beer is OUTSTANDING! Not much bitterness but tons of fruit and floral hop flavors, mostly grapefruit and orange with slight pepper notes that really make it interesting. This is a well-balanced WORLD CLASS IIPA!"
"Pours hazy, smells floral, tastes and feels awesome. Trillium never disappoints and this one is up there. Only problem it is too drinkable, if that is a problem. Top notch double IPA"
Nice golden unfiltered appearance with a strong citrus hop smell. Nice smooth mouth feel that's I expect from a high end DIPA
"From a share in September 2015. Fresh bottle, super tasty. Fruit juice mixed with beer. Tropical, citrus, balanced, and smooth. I expect nothing less from them!"
Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to NizzleEGizzle for hooking me up.
Had this side by side artaic. This is very very dank resinous DIPA. Lots of tropical fruit and pine in the aroma but a good amount of hop bitterness in the taste and finish. Malt is very well balanced. Very Very good DIPA but not the best Trillium makes.
"Like everything from Trillium, this is a well crafted brew. Light floral fresh citrus scent that is replicated in the taste. Balanced, smooth and drinkable with a medium bitter finish. Not their best, but solid and worth a try (or three)."
Thanks to Kyle for sharing.
"Looked great, nice cloudy appearance. Really smooth good taste, not too strong or bitter."
"Look - Had to make sure I actually poured the beer and not my children's orange/grapefruit juice. Murky, completely hazed....looks exactly like juice in the tulip. And a big pillowy white head that I'd lay on if I could. Amazing looking stuff! "
"Pours a cloudy peach color. Has a huge bitter hop and tropical fruit aroma. Flavor is tropical fruit ( guava, papaya ) but it's not as bitter as the aroma. Very clean finish and leaves a nice aftertaste of fruity hops. Very good DIPA"
"Rusty orange with a dirty white head that lasts and laces nice. Notes of grapefruit, mango, tangerine, citrus rinds and light pineapple. Restrained bitterness, soft feel, chewy medium body and dry. This is everything I love in a DIPA and its executed so well. Definitely a top beer for me."
Trillium Vicinity DIPA
This was an amazing beer for me. It was like the first time I had heady topper but without any of the expectations and hype going into it. I knew nothing of this beer. Ton of floral fruity fresh hop resin aroma. Flavor was a nice grassy citrus papaya guava. Bitterness was very low for me. Almost as if all hops were flame out/dry hop additions.
"I'm not usually one for Galaxy hops, but they added just enough Citra (and something else?) to make this quite enjoyable. Trillium beers are always lovely to have in your mouth."
Good beer overall but I am finding I prefer their pales especially DDH ones to their DIPAs
Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Trillium tulip glass. Thanks Steve for hooking me up with this!
L: Hazy yellow with some orange at the center. Nice head and lacing.
"Not bad, kinda disappointed really. It was solid though"
"Pours golden yellow and very hazy with a three finger head. Smell is dank and citrusy with earthy notes. Taste is crisp and bitter, very dank with citrus filling your whole mouth. Peppery/spicy mouthfeel, but not overwhelming. Dry hoppy finish. Really an amazing double IPA through and through."
"Poured 25 oz bottle dated 8/25/15 unto a snifter. Pours a cloudy gold, with a 1.5 inch fluffy white head. Smell was very tropical, with pineapple, grapefruit and orange, with a bit of grassiness. Taste is citrusy, with grapefruit the most distinct flavor, and a grassy, earthy taste that fades into a soft bitterness. Really light in the mouth, with a pleasant medium carbination. Overall this is a very well put together beer. Very drinkable, with a great nose and a nice complex flavor. Another strong offering from Trillium. I see what all the fuss is about!"
"Vicinity is everything you have come to expect from Trillium: great nose, great taste, and a clean finish. "
"750 mL bottle, dated 8/25/15 poured into a tulip"
"Pale murky color with white head. Aroma is very vegetal and herbal, with chive and dill notes. Taste is very fresh with the same vegetal and dank notes. Body is really smooth. Very tasty and easy to drink. Seems more like a single than a double IPA."
"The Bros need to get another bottle, period. Light, flavorful, excellent aroma and just all-around one of the best DIPAs that I've had the pleasure of sampling. Very glad I grabbed 4 bottles of this."
"One of the best. Dank, citrusy and light bodied all at once. Beautiful to look at, wonderful to sniff, and mind-blowing to taste. Consider yourself lucky to find this beer as your companion."
"750, No date but tastes damn fresh. Citrus and grapefruit. Bright hops. Mild bitterness. Very good."
"Excellent. Very light for the percentage and as glowing and mellow as I'd come to expect from Trillium. Can't believe this is a double IPA, goes down so easy and with so much flavor."
"No question I would have identified this as a Trillium beer without seeing the bottle, or even blindfolded. Beautiful looking brew, tastes of tropical fruits and funky earth and, very faintly, of sweet caramel-vanilla malt. Thick luscious mouthfeel. I'm in love."
"Jason, love ya, bro. I usually find your reviews to be spot on. Not this time. This is a really, really good DIPA. I would blame your experience on a bad pour."
Second Trillium beer ever tasted and I am already a huge fan. Lots of tropical fruit in this with a velvety finish to it. I'm ready to start driving up to Boston every week.
"Don't believe any negative review of this brew...this is an amazing IPA, only knock on this is the kick at the end from the abv not hidden as well as some other Trillium beers. I have had this after possibly the 2 other best Trillium creations ever so this may be tainted but it sure as hell is excellent! Tons of mango and pineapple maybe some good green dank qualities - an awesome beer, must try for all hoppy lovers"
Got Vicinity in a trade recently. Bottled date 7/22/15. I've really wanted to try something from Trillium for a while... It was able to exceed my expectations. 
"Cloudy orange color, thick head slowly fades to thin layer. From aroma to taste this is juicy. Not much malt, citrusy hops, grapefruit and orange throughout. A little earthy at the end. Medium thick mouthfeel. Overall good IPA, juicy with soft hops. Doesn't taste Ike 8%."
"Im shocked the bros rated this so low. Great double ipa, wonderful flavor and great body. Not super bitter. Classic Trillium for sure, cant believe this isnt rated higher"
Not too bitter. Reminds me of blueberries and a delicate grapefruit flavor.
"The beer is a tannish burnt orange color. Rocky off white head. Lots of lacing. Nice sweet tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Little malt character. Very nice. The taste is light and full of hop fruit flavor. Mango, pineapple, a little papaya, mild tangerine. Good stuff. No real malt sweetness but it is fairly sweet. It makes me think of hoppy beers that stay away from early hop additions. Moderate bitterness in the finish. Solid DIPA."
Bottled on 7/22/15 and consumed on 8/1/15. 
"Pours very murky, almost looks like a less orangy glass of orange juice. Great smell, addicting. Taste is solid, nothing amazing though. Has a peanuty taste I like, tastes better as it warms."
This is another top notch offering from Trillium. Bottled 7/23/15. Hazy and bursting with citrus hop goodness. Literally could not stop smelling and drinking this beer. Phenomenal stuff!
"Look is a hazy, yellow/orange with a bright white head"
L- a hazy golden orange
"Pours like other Trillium hops, beautifully hazy. The nose is a hop bomb."
Bottled 7/22/15 super fresh. 
"Had this on 7/22/15, the day it was bottled. Cloudy and bright appearance. Aroma has layers of fruity hop notes. Flavor is straight-up citrus. Notes of grapefruit are most apparent but not over the top. Really well balanced and drinkable with moderate bitterness on the back. Reminiscent of a Hill Farmstead IPA. Overall, this is one of the best beers Trillium puts out."
"Pours a completely hazy, lovely sun-yellow color, with a big, extremely stable head. "
"The beer comes in a beautiful hazy bright orange, almost like Sunny D, with a big fluffy white head."
"Yellow, golden color with a slight haziness. Nice citrus and lemon aroma with a little pine bitterness. Flavor matches perfectly. Very smooth, balanced, and flavors are well blended."
Bottle from brewery poured into snifter tasting glass.
Good balance but the flavor is not as strong as the galaxy dry hopped fort point. The citrus flavors are there but not as intense.
"beautiful haziness. Get pine mostly in the aroma, a little citrus. Really good body, get some of the malt and a lot of pine in the flavor. It dissipates quickly on the back end. Really nice beer, First beer from the brewery and definitely looking forward to trying other offerings out."
poured from 750 ml bottle from brewery. 
"bottle, hazy yellow, aroma is slight onion, dank pine and citrus. Full body citrus and dank DIPA, so easy to drink, amazing beer"
This marks the first time I've been a little disappointed in a Trillium brew. This has an odd vegetal taste in the finish that sits on the back of the tongue. It is actually tasty until that note hits and sticks in the finish.
Pours an amber orange color. The aroma is juicy fruity and grassy. The taste itself has a medium bitterness reminiscent of some fruity rind and finishes clean. I prefer Artaic but this is a great Pale Ale in a line up of fantastic Pale Ales from Trillium.
"This beer pours a very cloudy light golden with some burnt orange highlights. The head is 2 fingers, bright white, dense and made up of very very tiny bubbles. Retention is very good and there are many sheets of hanging lacing. Smell is mango, orange, pineapple, peach, dankness and a slight earthiness. Taste is the same sans pineapple. Just a slight bitterness on the finish. Feel is amazing. Medium and a bit sticky but so soft and juicy. Overall an awesome beer. Just amazing!"
"Poured into two Teku glasses. One for this guy, and one for this guy's hophead girlfriend."
"Review 1,300. Picked a local brewery to mark "
Tropical nose and taste. Pineapple grapefruit mango. Incredible
"Poured out as a hazy yellowish gold color with a thin white head on top. The smell has some awesome hoppy notes, not too much else going on but still awesome. The taste is well done also, great bitterness and sweetness working together. The feel is on the heavier side, good amount of body. Overall it's an awesome beer."
Typical Trillium haziness.
"Hazy, light pineapple yellow with a thin, white head that eventually dissipates into a white lacing."
"042515. Seriously gorgeous, light golden-yellow color...but I'm biased towards unfiltered beers. And this one is beyond unfiltered. Cloudy, thick, hazy, opaque...every word to describe such a beauty. Great head and lace/retention as to be expected. Huge, pungent citrus and tropical fruit. But this is unique in that it bites your nose and senses. Only a few IPAs I've experienced can do that. I also get some raw, unfiltered, honey. Not sure if this makes sense. Same with the taste/flavor...so much citrus, fruit, juicy wet hops, pine. The epitome of hops and the style. Body, feel, and drinkability are obviously off the charts. Wow. Just wow. Unbelievable beer. Thank you, again, judkinst!!!"
"22oz. bottle served in a tulip at 44 degrees. Bottled 042515. Pours a dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head that eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Clarity is quite turbid and lacing is delicate and textured. Nose expresses tangerines, citrus rind, and a grassy/spicy quality towards the back. Taste is a bit odd - consistent with nose in many ways; however, there's a strange medicinal quality in the middle and a light earthy hops presence at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a crisp carbonation and a kiss of acidity. Overall, decent DIPA but not my favorite Trillium offering. Nose and flavor profile comes off a bit muddled."
Awesome offering from Trillium! Nice bright hoppy start and finish but not that bitter
a great DIPA as usual from trillium but a tad malty for my taste....
world class IIPA.. super citrusy and dank.. love how hazy it is- this flagship Trillium Double IPA is world class all the way around. mouthfeel is epic-
Pours a hazy golden-orange with foamy white head
Look: Opaque hazy pale orange with a very thin white head that just rims the glass. No activity visible. 
"A: Hazy, light pineapple yellow with a thin, white head that eventually dissipates into a white lacing."
Bottled 04/06/15. Tulip glass.
"Looks really good! I don't get a ton of hops in the nose like others and the taste is a tad too onion-y and vegetal. Based on the average review, I must be crazy. Oh well, maybe a bad bottle. Cheers! Love what Trillium is doing overall!"
What a nose!!!! Citrus and even a touch of lemon. Let it warm up a little and backend grows. Don't let the bros fool you this is a fantastic beer. Talk of no backend is completely off base. Trillium is a master in citrus and this beer does not disappoint.
Smooth!! This beer had me tasting my tongue. It leaves a great taste in your mouth.. Grapefruit pineapple something is sticking out??! Top level beer
750 poured into a snifter. Another beer Gyoungit shared.
Thanks Kevin for sharing a bottle of this last night. Notes taken at the time.
"Pour is a dark amber, extremely hazed, light edges, tight white head that lingers for a little and leaves a thick lacing. Nose has a rich tropical fruit presence, pineapple, peach, light orange citrus, a bit of caramel malt and notes of resin. Body is full and heavy, assertive carb, gets a touch sticky. Some sweet malt backbone, a little sugary, hops are super aggressive, Peach, citrus, faint resin. Finish is fairly bitter and takes away from the clean hop flavors slightly."
"Beer had no finish. It just drops off. Got a growler fill at the brewery and wanted to like it, but 5 glasses later it's just not there."
Way higher then a rated 70 .
A seventy by the bros? Must have gotten a bad bottle. This is good.
Was curious why the Bros. had this at a 70 while the tasters had it at a 100. I am somewhere between the Bros. and the world on this... no doubt... this is a solid double and totally worth getting a hold of... but after having the Upper Case... tough to rate above that one. Something in the finish... a little tart... that took away from the smooth aftertaste of some of the other doubles in this class.
"L- hazy, golden"
Great looking new wave New England style DIPA. A juicy banger.
Very tasty double IPA. Floral to the nose and delightful in the mouth! Highly recommend!
"Fruit forward and incredibly unique. Carb is a bit strange. Mouthfeel overall detracts from it. Otherwise, it is really an unusual and interesting DIPA."
"A fantastic beer that is rated ""70"" and ""ok"" by ""The Bros."" Sup with that?! Must be a mistake."
Damn near perfect. My first experience with Trillium buoyed the hype.
"Very distinct taste, yet reminiscent of certain other double IPAs. Well done."
From Notes:
"Ugly, but very tasty tropical flavors."
Thanks maddogg for tossing this my way! Enjoyed from a bells monster wit glass.
"Bottled 1/28/15, two weeks old or so."
Bomber poured into a Pilsner
"750 ML bottle dated 1/20/2015 poured into a larger version of the Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Beer comes out an extremely hazy cloudy dark yellow color. Glows when you hold it up to the light, but you still can't see through it. Little bit of a head mostly small bubbles but a few a little bigger that stick around and provide a little bit of lacing, but not a ton. To sum it up it kind of looks like pineapple juice with a head on it. Not really how I prefer my double IPAs to look because it's so hazy, but I guess some like it that way."
"L: Orange haze, like a creamsicle"
First Trillium brew. I'm very impressed. Hazy as all hell and delicious to boot.
From the recent 2/2015 release. Served in a snifter 2/8/2015.
"About a 10 day old bottle, thanks steve"
"Looks very murky and odd to me. The smell is fantastic. Huge hop aroma with some grainy and malty notes coming out. The taste is very nice. I was expecting more though. Must be the hype (smh). It has a yeasty taste if that makes any sense. Plenty of hops come through and it has a nice malt flavor to it. it's a very different DIPA than the norm but I like it. Overall, this is pretty good."
"Way overhyped by locals. Heavy Mettle and Congress St. are far more complete and well rounded. Please rate beer accordingly, not just to hype up trade value."
Poured from bottle dated 1/20 into tulip glass.
"Pours a hazy golden, light orange color. White colored head dissipates in fashion with double IPA style big lacing is present on glass. Tremendous smell full of tropical hops with some dank in there. Delicious grapefruit, tropical, dry hop taste. Medium body with some carbonation but still has plenty of smoothness. World class."
Cloudy orange. Short head but great lacing. Beautiful hop aroma. Smells like someone dropped a pound of hops into a carton of Ocean Spray. Bright citrus flavor with a piney bitterness. great job with the balance. Very smooth double ipa.
Poured from bottle dated 1/20/15.
"First point: I am VERY critical of IPAs. I believe most people taste what they smell and give automatic huge scores to super hoppy beers, and then shit on Heady because it doesn't smell as good as others and makes them sound cool. Nice, guys, keep it real."
"Turbid appearance, minimal head. Smells of yeast, hops & grain. Not sure why this beer was not finished. Some hop character pops up but the turbid pour and yeasty mealy tone doesn't cut it. Love what Trillium is doing but I'll have to respectfully disagree with this beer. I'll try to revisit it again but trying it several times I doubt this beer has changed."
Wow! This is one of the best DIPAs I have ever had and I have had them all!
A: Nice cloudy amber smaller white head with big bubble and not the best lacing
Bright west coast style DIPA that looks very clean in the glass with slight carb. Some citrus rind and pine needle on the nose. Taste is bright and citrusy along with a bitter punch. Reminds me of a mixture of the Alpine standard IPAs. Very slick mouthfeel and no malt getting in the way. Superb DIPA.
"This is one of Trilium's premier IPAs. A lot of great citrus taste up front but yet so smooth on the back end. And don't forget the nose, it shows what a great IPA smells like."
Just awesome. Trillium wins again.
"Hazy yellow straw appearance with head that quickly fades, decent lacing. Smells like tropical hi-c or ecto cooler. Taste bursts with sweet citrus fruits then fades into dank hops. Predictably great beer from Trillium."
"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a willibecher. This was bottled on 01/20/15, which was 4 days ago as of this review."
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"Bottle. Pours a hazy, pale orange color. Glowing. Head is a ripple froth congregation. Not much lace. Fruit juice hop liquid. Very reminiscent to Trillium's Mettle and Heavy Mettle. Pineapple, citrus, some bubblegum, peach and mango hops. Blasphemous amounts of aromatic hops. The flavor is such a concentrated influx of hoppiness that all flavors border on excess. That's a compliment in my book. I expected a brine of pure hop and I got it. All those fruity descriptors can be found here and in plentiful quantities. Rich, dank and superbly fruity. Malt? Provided a surprising balance that leads to a finish that is spookily mellow. Bitterness is low and I actually am jiving with it. The body is also stunningly light. This brew is another hop cauldron from Trillium. They have a very specific flavor and it reminds me a lot of some of their previous offerings. I have also absolutely loved those previous offerings. Did they do it again? Yes, comrade, yes."
"Gotta agree with the bros here to some degree. This beer used to be much better! Is this a colab with a resturant(s) in the area e.g ""34"" ? Hence the term vicinity ? Either way! Used to better!"
"A - opaque light orange, almost has a glow to it looks like carbonated juice, 1 inch white head."
"Growler. Not quite as good as Heavy Mettle, but still another fantastic Trillium product."
"Hazy yellow with a small creamy head. A fair amount of lacing. The aroma is a bit dank with notes of mango and orange citrus. Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is creamy with moderate carbonation. The flavor has lots of orange citrus, tropical fruit, a little pine and bready sweetness. It finishes bitter and dry with lingering citrus. This is a delicious beer that can compete with the big boys."
Review from the first batch (11/6/14)
"Abner-esque. Yes, it's that good. Tropical fruit juice, big grapefruit bitterness and a super clean malt bill."
"02.06.15 Re Review out of bottle - This beer for me is now dialed in - everything is clicking. Sorry for not being more precise. Read my original review at your peril, just to show how much improved a great beer can get. Was being honest at the time, and in my interest in being archival, I'm saving it. Will delete all and re-review again at next bottle purchase. Thanks."
"Another top notch IPA from Trillium. My first taste of Mettle was probably better, but who knows? This brewery knows how to make IPAs."
This beer is outstanding and perhaps my favorite Trillium so far. It is incredibly smooth and has such an ease to the mouthfeel. Hops are slightly reminiscent of baseball card gum in the best way imaginable. The abv sneaks in a bit on the finish and just leaves me begging for a rounder ~6?% version. That said it is a dub ipa so I think bigger ipa fans are going to be thrilled with this and rightfully so. If this is Trillium progression we are all pleased. In the vicinity of greatness?
Another great DIPA from Trillium. Great colour and extremely smooth for a DIPA. Very drinkable. Trillium continues to make great beers.
Opaque nearly glowing orange-yellow with a moderate off-white fizz that settles to a soft central film and a raised but thin collar.
"16 oz can, into glass"
"Canned 7/10/18. Enjoying in a glass, at home, courtesy of the in-laws. "
"Trillium DDH street IPAs always seem to be so well balanced. Not to bitter, not too boosy. El dorado oftentimes tastes too candy like so was a bit hesitant but this is the best el Dorado beer I have had."
Pint canned on 7/10/18 opened up on 7/15/18
"Pours to the lighter side of the NE IPA-style, very hazy but not milkshake consistency, and looks like the glass of grapefruit juice I had this morning, except this has a thick, tan head. The nose is full of grapefruit notes and some spicy citrus aromas, but there’s an earthy note that’s intriguing."
2/20/18. Exactly 1 month old can date. Nice dark amber-honey color with a creamy head of 2 fingers. 
DDH Sleeper Street - Trillium
The beer pours a deliciously white and creamy head that dissipates at a moderate pace. It still leaves a good amount of beer around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a cloudy and opaque medium orange that strongly resembles orange juice. It is beautiful.
Serving: Can
Solid beer. Very interesting flavor profile with the Key Lime feel and zest. Solid. Just can't get too amped for this in the mail. Toppling Goliath beers are blasting this right now locally
Canned 11 days ago. My twenty-fifth review of a Trillium beer! 
"Poured into a can shaped pint glass canned on 2/13/18. Pours like a glass of pineapple orange juice, with a 2 finger sticky head, and leaves behind loads of webby lace."
Drinking from a 4 day old can poured into an appropriate glass. Murky yellow orange with a 2 finger head. The descriptors from Trillium are on point. Just fantastic stuff. One can't drink regular things after this...
Wonderful. I keep getting happier and happier having to rate a treasure trove of their beers I lucked out on as I was heading to Florida for the winter. AND to get bragging rights as well. Damned if it gets much better than this. Thank u Trillium.
"All the good things one would expect, but at the end of the day...El Dorado doesn’t leave me enthralled. This was in a tulip at the 5 Horse"
"Pours a hazy orange color with a one inch white head that left a nice ring of lacing. Smells of tropical and citrus fruits. Tastes of mango and orange with additional notes of grapefruit, lime, pine and malt. Medium bodied and carbonated, moderate bitterness, smooth mouth feel."
masterful hoppy creation. on tap at the source. dry finish. medium mouthfeel. emphasizing dry hop flavour. Had again and liking again a year later. Trillium unique.
"Pours a hazy orange, with fine, thick foam."
Poured from a tallboy can into a pint glass.
"Pours a matte bright golden yellow color. Thin off-white head dissipates steadily leaving a ring of foam along the outside of the beer. Smell has notes of orange and grapefruit with some lime and that dried out hop aroma you get in DDH beers. Taste follows the nose with notes of orange, grapefruit, lime, and a biscuity malt backbone. The dry hopping provides a strong hop burn but not much bitterness. Feel is light and smooth. Moderate to medium carbonation - a bit fizzy on the tongue. Overall a fantastic IPA from Trillium - very nice use the DDH with this one. Definitely worth trying."
Had on draft at the Trillium beer garden on the greenway. 
"Our 2nd beer purchased at the Canton brewery. 16Oz can stamped 28 Aug poured into a 16Oz trillium tulip glass. Murky orange/pineapple look and a definite citrus nose is followed by complex citrus flavors that may include grapefruit, orange, lemon/lime, mango and a hint of malt. A very enjoyable, flavorful and refreshing beer."
A: Poured a hazy appearing blend of OJ and pear juice. barely a noticeable head. 
"looks like OJ with a loose white head recedes pretty quickly, no lacing. solid aromas of peach, mango, grapefruit, dankness, pithy green note, this like spicy plastic thing going on. palate follows - juicy orange, grapefriut, some pithy citrus peel, bit of yeasty spice and herbaceous character. mouthfeel is solid, nice offering!"
"Pours a cloudy, banana-yellow color with orange and gray hues. Three fingers of airy, golden head that's fairly quick to dissipate and leaves modest, spotty lacing."
"No shit, this beer is world-class... Had the good fortune to buy it at the brewery's Fort Point location with 3 days on it... got the opaque medium gold juice-like appearance, with a finger or two of ivory foam... Full of zesty citrus, courtesy of the Columbus and El Dorado hops - got lots of lime and grapefruit impressions - tart, tangy, zesty, and bright - plush feel but super tingly... Medium-light weight, ample carbonation, moderate bitterness, mildly sweet... Right up my NEIPA alley... 8/28/17 canning..."
I've had it in cans and on tap at the Trillium brew house. One of the best Trillium creations.
"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with white head. Aroma is grapefruit and citrus notes. Taste is well balanced with flavors of grapefruit, floral, caramel, orange, some earthy resin. Very well done IPA."
Hazy yellow/orange with minimal head
"Lots of what makes Trillium beers so good: beautiful coloring and haze, pungent citrus, tropical fruit, and dank grass aromas and flavor. Sticky, silky, medium mouthfeel. But DDH Sleeper Street comes off (for me) a bit overly harsh and bitter, almost ridiculously dry-hopped for the sake of being big and bold, with the end result being a little bit messy. Part of that may be the El Dorado focus, which sometimes rubs my palette the wrong way."
Another winner from Trillium. The street series is excellent and this is one of the better brews from that series. Like most Trillium brews its very well balanced and super smooth. Well done
"Canned on 5/17. Looks like pineapple juice with an off-white head that held on longer than expected. Nice ring that leaves no lacing as the level drops in the pint glass. Very sweet fruit smells once the can was popped, must be the DDH...the smaller the sip the sweeter it tastes initially, that sweetness gives way to the bitter hops but, there is a return of the sweetness in the aftertaste that is unexpected! A little thinner than other Trilliums but i found the carbonation to be gentle. A solid beer that I wish I had more of. Would be a good one to share!"
On tap at Armsby Abbey
"Little bit more citrusy than some of the other street series beers, which I really like. I still put DDH Congress street as my top street series beer, but DDH Sleeper is right up there with it."
"L: cloudy, yellow orange color thin head, little carbonation and minimal lacing"
Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
"Poured 5/17/17 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 5/15/17, into a mug glass."
"Murky light orange pour, 1 finger of white head, webs of lace. Stonefruit and citrus in the aroma. Peach and grapefruit up front, floral, fruit juice, very grassy. Medium body, light astringency."
"Citrus, tropical, turbid. Revisited this beer after a long gap since last I tried it. My palate has come a long way (and racked up many a hop-beating) since, but my impression still stacks up: ultra hopped, super tropical, pungent but so soft and smooth throughout. I'm not a fan of the turbid OJ pour and this is the archetype of the style. From there it's all tropical fruit - guava, passion orange, papaya, pineapple - ovrlayed on a malt base that holds up quite well. Barely any bitterness; completely unbalanced."
"16 oz can, dated 3/8/17, poured into a teku"
A pounder can into a tumbler appears slightly darker than what a watered down version of jello vanilla pudding would look like if you poured it into a glass. It boasts a white cap that fades quick leaving a full curtain of lace.
"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a white head. Nose is floral and citrus. Taste of citrus upfront. Grapefruit juice and pith, lemon zest, lime and orange zest. A nice bit of earthyness and floral to it as well as light pine. A light bit of heat from the alcohol. Medium bodied with a crisp pithy bitterness that carries this beer to a dry finish."
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
"Pours tangerine merky as hell. Two finger white head that fades slowly as it hangs on the sides of snifter. Aroma mango, orange tangerine. Taste follows the nose with a bread doughy middle, pineapple and light lime juice. Another great IPA from trillium. Big fan of them."
"When Trillium dials in their hoppy offerings, they are very tough to beat. This double dry hopped offering is absolutely another gem from these guys. Kudos!"
My first impression of Trilium beers is not good.
A: Poured from the can into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy ambery-honey in color with a small off-white head on top.
"Pours a rich, golden hue of orange with an opaque transparency. Head foams up to two fingers in height and white in color, and retains well with a few dashes of lacing left behind. Aroma is orange and citrusy, floral and earthy, and dank. Lots of hop qualities that all perform well, and avoid the citrus dripping aromas of similar beers. Flavor profile is citrus, floral, earthy, and dank. Orange juice notes intertwine to develop an interesting flavor profile. Interesting in the sense that it's in-ordinary, and yet is flavored extremely well with a balance that leans more on the sugary side of the sweet vs. bitter. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a smooth texture that only has a fine amount of fizz to it. Overall, this beer drinks resoundingly smooth, with an interesting hop profile. The variation from the typical hop notes spewed by beers of this style, paired with the smooth feel makes this one incredible ""North East"" IPA. "
Can dated 03/08/17 - Purchased at the Canton location - Poured into an English pub glass
"Love the lime feel on this. Poured from a 32 oz growler into an IPA glass. Really great beer all around. Perhaps one of my new favorites from their ddh street series. Bursts of melon, tropical fruit, and zesty citrus. Lays heavy on the palette."
"16 oz can split into two El Cat tulips with Lisa - thanks to (the legendary home brewer) Rob F for grabbing this for us. Bright orange, hazy color. Thin layer of foam, some lacing. Smells like orange, light grapefruit, and some bitter pine. Tastes even better, bursting with citrus flavors like lemon, passionfruit, grapefruit, and pine. Firm but not assertive bitterness throughout. Really nice, full mouthfeel. Top notch IPA."
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 01/17/17) into a Veil House glass
1/17/17 pint can poured into large snifter
"Typical hazy, turbid body with a huge, fluffy off-white head. Aroma is big on stone fruits, lime and hints of fresh citrus. Flavor has a lot of citrus zest, bitter grapefruit and lime being the most prominent. Feel is smooth, bitter, lingering bitterness. Solid IPA that has a little more bitterness and less juiciness than some of trilliums other offerings."
"Finally got to have this last week. Very tasty, orange juice almost to the taste. No bitterness at all and went down very smooth. Light hop smell with a mix of fruits like orange and mangoes."
Poured into a Sierra Nevada Spiegelau glass. Bottom of can says 01/17/17.
"16oz can, purchased from the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street becher glass. Enjoyed on 12.30.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Look-Color is an opaque, Murky Tan with an orange tint to it. Pours two inches of white, frothy head that retains beautifully."
"16 oz can dated 12/2/16 (so 6 weeks old or so) Poured into a pint glass as an opaque, orange juice color. Head barely topped half an inch and dissipated rather quickly. That's a knock for me. Nice clumps of lacing on the glass though."
"I've had a lot more better Trilliums than this one. It feels/smells/tastes too dry. I've had a lot of their DDH versions but this one just doesn't do it for me. I like dry hopping a lot, just feels overdone here."
"16 oz can dated 12/1. A little older than I would like, but when someone gives you a Trillium, you shut up and drink it. Poured into Belgian ale glass."
"First had 1/2/17 at home from Andy K. Another great From Trillium. I get a lemon, grassy finish, and always the ultra creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Can't wait to visit on my way to EBF 2017!!!"
Bttld 03-09-16. Drank 04-15-16. Ooh La La!!! Beautiful citrus. Spicy finish. Fantastic!
"This is probably my favorite trillium offering so far and one that truly stands unique amongst the rest. When you first crack the can, all you can smell is orange. You don't even need to be close to it to notice the strong aroma. Pours a light very hazy yellow orange that falls more towards the yellow side than the red spectrum. About an inch of off white head that dissipates over the course of a few minutes leaving a ring around the edge of the glass with lacing throughout. The smell of this beer is an orange bomb! I love orange so I love the smell. You also get a bit of lime on the very front of your nose, especially as the beer warms up. Taste follows the smell with a pleasant not overly bitter back end. Some of the street beers can be a bit too bitter for my tastes but this one has just the right amount for me. It is sweet up front from the citrus nose but the middle is dry and it leaves a lingering citrus candy aftertaste from the hop resins. The feel of this beer is medium thick with a moderately lively carbonation; has a nice body. Overall this beer is great! Awesome nose that is not ruined by an overtly bitter finish. Citrusy and smooth."
Hazy nectar. Citrus zest and almost overripe mango. Huge hop bite that immediately smoothed out into a warm subtle pithy sweetness. Just the right amount of carbonation. Setting the standard for what I expect from the DDH offerings. Well done.
"Canned 12/1/2016, it pours cloudy yellow gold with a foamy 1+ finger foamy white head that was packed with tiny bubbles, fading slowly and leaving really damn good foamy lacing that sticks to the glass. "
From can poured int snifter
Acquired by Nimrod. So tasty. Crisp and fresh with grapefruit and cantaloupe.
Typical orange hazy trillium beer. 
Julius by Tree House vs Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street Trillium. The same freshness.
"Can received in trade with Jason. Big thanks! Lots of tangerine, reminds me a bit of tang orange drink."
"Too fresh? Found this to be very bitter after drinking on the day of canning and the days following. After about the 6th day though, something magical happened. Minimal bitterness and a somewhat spun sugar citrus/lime/slightly dank flavor prevailed. Blown away by its matured smoothness. Fantastic ipa. Very impressed."
"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with minimal head. Taste is orange, peach, cracker, and light woodiness. Light bodied and slightly sweet. Juicy and the smoothest of the Trillium IPAs I have had so far. Well worth seeking out."
"Bright orange color, hazy, with a finger of head that leaves some lacing on the glass and on the surface of the beer. Nose is orange peel, lime zest, melon, faint pineapple, grapefruit. Citrus forward. Floral notes on the front of the tongue followed by citrus, melon, and lime. Some resin and herbal notes. No malt at all. Mouth feel is full bodied, but clean, not fluffy like some of their other beers. Very dry throughout. Enjoyed this one a lot."
"Was a little disappointed in this one. Strange taste that I can't quite figure out, almost ultra bitter. Great color and smell, but the taste was just odd, hard to explain. I read someone else's review that was almost the exact same so I know I'm not crazy. I'll give it another shot though since everything else they have is great."
Can dated 9/27. 
Canned 9/27/16. Consumed 10/6/16.
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
"Big pillowy fluffy 1 finger head fades at a med pace, murky pale orange color, tons of sticky lacing."
A- A tall can drops a hazy golden yellow brew into a tall chalice. Atop that beer a thick and creamy white cap rises up to about a half inch high with good retention. Wide sheets of lace coat a large area on the glass.
A: pours a brownish orange with a moderate sized bubbly head. Leaves some lacing. 
I had high expectations but this beer really disappointed. There was a flavor that I still can't put my finger on but was definitely a little off. It was still good but not up to Trillium's usual quality. Perhaps the can was mis-handled or the batch a bit off. I will try it again and update my review as warranted.
Can received in a recent trade.
"16oz. can served in a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned 8/23/16 (DANGER ZONE) printed on the botton. Pours a hazy burnt orange with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head that settles into a soapy froth. Amazing nose! Guava, citrus and pith. Taste is more pithy and dank than tropical fruit with some resinous qualities that linger between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a prickly carbonation, light acidity and a residual burn at the finish. Another awesome IPA from the crew at Trillium. The nose is incredible!"
"One of my favorites from a recent Trillium tasting - the color on this is just gorgeous. Of course that is only topped by the nose, which filled the room."
"This is one of the juiciest IPAs I've ever had, lots of mango and orange flavor. Reminiscent of a creamsicle, but in a good way. Lots of tropical fruit in the aroma. So easy to drink, I drank this a lot faster than I had expected to, it was just delicious and smooth, a real pleasure."
"hazy yellow, no head. lacing. big pineapple and sweet lemon zest on nose. huge pineapple and pine on the tongue, maybe some lime, no malt, little bit of booze. feel is perfect. Dry-Hopping God(desse)s over at Trillium!!"
"Super turbid, more towards a yellow haze."
"750 mL bottle. Very cloudy yellow body. Smells fascinating. Lime, grapefruit, and a strong pine woody aroma. Tastes equally good. Lime and grapefruit citrus. Sweet pale malt. Some of that pine woodiness in the finish, but it's a little muted. Medium body. Absolutely delicious."
White head. Lace. Super hazy golden yellow.
"This beer pours very turbid and identical to tropicana orange juice with a fluffy 2 finger bright white head. Retention is excellent and lacing is fantastic. Smell is exactly as advertised, definitely getting the lime, grapefruit and earthiness. Taste is the same, but a little more subdued than the smell. Feel is light, soft, clean and juicy. Overall an excellent beer. Never gotten lime scent or taste before in a beer and it is definitely different. Not my favorite citrus note in a beer, but still excellent."
Bottle Date: 3/9/16
"Incredibly unique but just not a flavor profile that works for me. As Trillium describes, very floral. Huge lime notes. If you've had kaffir lime leaves in anything, that's the biggest flavor component. Far too sweet for me, candied. They say grapefruit, but to me I get a tangerine element, but slightly soured ... like how orange juice gets an alchohol note as it goes bad / sour. The woody note is very far in the back, buried a bit underneath a citrus pith bitterness. I really want a bit more bite / IBU from hops to bring this sweetness into balance."
"Hazy yellow body with a half inch of white head. Aromas of canteloupe, assorted melons, grapefruit, tart citrus. The flavor is more of the same. Sweet and tart melon. Hop forward and juicy. Dank and resinous. Tasty!"
"rowmark making my night with the goandpickitupformebros...bottle number 3. same hazy look as the others and killer lace, smell is way more candied, like the double dry hopped fort point. taste follows, this bottle has a month on it 3/9 date but still drinking nice. less tropical and more candied. smells awesome. tastes great."
Love the double dry hopped stuff trillium puts out. This one is refreshing and smooth. Nose falls off a bit as it warms but overall an amazing beer. Easy drinking.
The Trillium DDH line always delivers. These beer was hazy with a light golden hue. Great aroma and flavor. Very balanced and a great IPA as usual from them.
Pours a cloudy straw yellow color. Aroma is hoppy and pineapple citrus. Flavor is clean citrus peel with a pineapple like acidity to the citrus. Drink is a touch light but still this is a really delicious beer. Another great one from trillium.
"First time experiencing the greatness that is a Trillium IPA. Thanks for KeithP for the trade! The aroma of this beer is overwhelming. Room is overcome with tropical fruit notes. Mango, papaya, orange, pineapple. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Alcohol notes are non-existent. Everything you'd want from a New England IPA and more."
Poured from a capped 750ml bottle dated 3/9/16 into a Teku glass:
"750 ml bottle. Pours cloudy yellow orange, nice white head leaves sticky lace. Citrus and tropical fruit burst aroma. Big ole juice bomb taste, citrus pulp and pineapple, mild earthy notes towards the end. Soft slick mouth. Could drink this one for breakfast lunch and dinner, delish."
A: Coming to expect this in Trillium beers. Super super cloudy with an almost mango juice color and consistency. A thin off white head dies down quickly.
Classic Trillium golden opaque appearance.
Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Thanks Big Julius for hooking me up!
"Bottled 03/05/16, so 3.5 weeks old. Tulip glass."
"2 weeks old. Looks Trillium, smells trillium, tastes very nice. Pineapple and citrus on the nose, taste is citrus, very nice, really like this, but prefer ddh Congress just slightly"
750ml bottle dated 03/09/16
Too much lime
Typical opaque orange juice like Trilliul appearance. 
Made my first trip to Trillium this past Friday and picked this up along with 9 other bombers.
L: Classic turbid and hazy Trillium look with a generous inch high fluffy white head and moderate retention
Bottled dated 3/9/16; drank on 3/12/16; another new notch in my Trillium belt and another success on their part
"750 mL poured into a snifter. Classic Trillium pillowly mouthfeel but the weakest hop-profile of the several hoppy Trillium offerings I have had the opportunity to try to date. Still worth searching out, IMO."
Love trillium beers for the awesome texture almost every beer brings.
"Jesus, do these guys make a mediocre beer? Every beer Ive tried has been on another level, and this one is no exception. Just fantastic. Tropical aroma, pillowy mouthfeel, and insane flavor. Dank, sticky, fruity, and crushable."
"750 mL poured into a snifter. Appearance is an amber/yellowish gold and leaves minimal white head. Aromas of orange/clementine are strong with this one. The flavor is orange and citrus upfront with a big of spruce and grapefruit. Mouthfeel has medium body and carbonation. Overall, this one is super drinkable and well balanced! Even with the big bottle, you will definitely feel compelled to finish it by yourself. Definitely worth seeking out for sure! Cheers!"
L - a dark hazy orange/brown pour. not super appealing but nice head retention 
"Honestly, kinda shocked at the love here. Either that, or this brew travels super poorly. I think, though, that mostly this is a case of this particular hop profile (plus some travel issues) not working out for me. Heavily hazed dark orange body. I see folks post pics of stuff like this in bright daylight, and it does indeed look better, but under normal night time lighting, it's not especially attractive, just sorta muddy looking. As usual with Trillium brews, though, the head and lacing are top class. Nose is sort of generically fruity, neither the tropical fruit forwardness of their Citra/Nelson/Galaxy-oriented brews, nor more classic citrus/pine. It kinda made me think of Stone's Delicious IPA, which in turn makes me think this is a personal issue with El Dorado hops, as that beer didn't work a ton for me either. Is it sort of richly fruity (some places mention watermelon in El Dorado, and I guess I can see it maybe, though it's not particularly alluring), in the Trillium-style, all saturated and such? Kinda, although there's a distinctive malty note that, combined with the fruitiness and saturation, not to mention a sort of tangy yeasty note, makes this smell a bit like overripe fruit. Again, I think it pales in comparison to the clarity, pop, and depth of something like Pier. On the palate, it continues to struggle to get out of first gear, more overripe fruit, some decent bitterness. I don't know. I can't figure out if this is personal preference, Trillium brews having poor shelf stability (I drank this 23 days after bottling), or what. Clearly, I'm in the minority on this one. But, to my palate, this is the weakest Trillium offering I've had."
"Wow....just wow. As a Californian who just received a box full of Tree House & Trillium beers all canned and bottled within the same month, all I can say is WOW. You can keep the Pats and the Sox, I just want your breweries!"
"Poured into a Trillium snifter glass. Beautiful hazy orange color, compliments the fruity aromas that effervesce from the cup. A fruit bomb that has citrus flavors on the front end, finished off with a slight bitter hoppy taste on the palate. Well done Trillium!"
"L - casual, pale tangerine juice. Robust and creamy. Buoyant head with decent retention. "
"L-pours a beautiful hazy orange, nice long half inch head retention."
Tasty and unique showcase of El Dorado hops that screams lime and mint amongst a plethora of other candied fruit flavors.
My first double dry hopped beer from Trillium and it didn't disappoint! World class beer being made in what seems to be every batch. Highly recommended! (A+)
"Pours a golden hazy hue with a bright white head. There aroma is fruit jam, raspberry or strawberry, perhaps orange marmalade. There is some light candied berry sweetness up front followed by citrus and citrus zest. Some chocolate covered oranges, which I'm not crazy about. As with most Trillium IPAs, it has a soft mouthfeel. There is also that chalkiness that I also have found in Congress St, which I personally enjoy. I did not like this beer that much the first time I had it, but I have to say I enjoy it a lot more now."
"A: Cloudy, bright gold with a thick, white and foamy head that dissipates very slowly."
"Pours bright orange, unfiltered and hazy with a three finger head. Smells of sweet juicy citrus and earthy hops. Taste is smooth and light of tropical fruit and sweet crisp citrus. Peppery mouth-feel. Dank finish. Smooth is really the word for this. This beer smells like the inside of Trillium. Really fantastic, highly recommended."
32 oz growler poured into a tulip.
Sooo delicious ! Tried 3 Trillium DDH beers side by side and this one was the best of the 3
Beautifully cloudy. Big citrus smell and taste. I'm getting grapefruit and orange - maybe some tangerine. This place knows what they are doing!
Another thick yellowish beer from Trillium. Smell is of ripe mango and grapefruit. Tastes of these tropical flavors was there and finished with a nice sweet finish. Another wonderful offering from Trillium.
This is my favorite IPA at this particular time. It is one of the juiciest beers I have ever tasted. The Eldorado hops really shine in this beer. I love all the Trillium beers but in my opinion this is the best.
yellow bodied beer with big white head. Nice retention and lacing. Smells very orangy. Hop flavor profile is all about those orangy hop flavors and low bitterness is present. light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel and so drinkable that you want to gulp it down. Overall what a great hoppy beer from trillium. Thanks TATURBO!
perfect beer. epic orange citrus ipa bomb
Intense. so good I had to buy two bottles.
"A - four fingers of dense white hard. Tight bubbles and rolling. Excellent lacing and retention. Unfiltered, pulpy orange-peach-golden body."
I had a hard time saying this but now that I have I said it I know it's true as of right now. This is the best beer I've ever had!
Tons of orange. A little bit of that melon that I associate with most Trillium IPAs (but not over-ripe in this instance).
"This beer knocked my socks off. Excellent orange flavor, smooth as silk, beautiful to look at, nearly a perfect beer."
Another solid offering from trillium!
Thanks to bilco for picking up the bottle.
"2.11.15 Bottle, Thanks Chris!"
Bomber poured into snifter
"L: hazy orange, almost like grapefruit juice"
"Bottle from thegerm. Thanks man! Poured after Galaxy Fort Point on 3/2/15, bottle dated 2/11/15. Pours hazy golden color with a creamy, fluffy white head on top. Aroma is a bit more malt forward than the GFP, with sweet notes of honey and melon, mango, pineapples, tropical citrus. Flavor is sweet papaya and melon, some pineapple in the background, low bitter and higher on the sweetness. Medium bodied, medium low carbonation, dank and more syrupy than the others (not in a bad way). Some interesting malty bready flavors lingering on the finish. A good bit of lower level from others from Trillium that I've had thus far. Almost like sweet melon juice and the hops are surprisingly mellow here given the supposed large dry hop. Nice."
"From bottle. Super cloudy pale orange. Trace amounts of fine white suspension. Decent head, good lacing. Super vibrant fruit hops on the nose. Some biscuity malt as well. Strong citrus taste with a nice bitter peel. Nice resiny feel. Coats the throat. Good thickness."
"Fresh 750ml poured into HF stemware. I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of this brew. The mouthfeel was excellent, soft in the same way that HF ipas are. The aroma was incredible and the taste was reminiscent of Mastermind in that it was juicy and chock full of tropical fruit. Mango, tangerine, and a touch of sweetness."
The beer comes in a hazy yellow orange color.
Poured from a bottle dated 2/11/15 into a tulip.
"Very good, hop bomb from the smell but not much bitterness from the taste. I liked it more than DDH Melcher, but not as much as DDH Fort Point, which is strange because regular Melcher is my favorite Trillum IPA and Sleeper Street not as much. Go figure."
"Bright citrus hops and biscuit malts in the smell. Lots of orange rind, lime and tangerine juice. Tongue tingling bitterness with a little bit of sweetness. It's obvious good, but maybe not quite up to the other DDH Trillium offerings."
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
"Very hazy, the color of lemon juice with a slight pink tinge. Decent head that dissipates rather quickly."
Mmmm. Fresh and Tasty. Unfiltered and rich.
Can I just say it's fucking awesome?
"Bottle. Pours a very cloudy orange color. Awesome, oily, frothy head. Drapes of lacing. Looks the part. Hop induced fruit purée. Genuinely smells like tangerines. Pineapples as well. All hops; all fruit. Very, very citrusy. Flavor has some greener, grassier elements. It still brings the citrus smoothie parade right down the middle. Clementine and tangerine, oh lawd! Malt is sweet but very well placed next to the hops. Sweet, doughy, pastry maltiness. High carbonation. Medium bodied. Surprisingly not overly bitter. Trillium doing Trillium things yet again."
Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. This was bottled yesterday.
"Posted a cloudy yellow-orange body with minimal head and no lace down the glass. Aroma has minimal sweetness with an earthy hoppiness to it. The beer has a sharp acidity to it in a light, juicy body, mix of citric and even lemon/orange sharpness, with a pineapple juice (almost tropical fruit) sweetness and sharp/sweet finish."
"Can shared a couple weeks ago not sure by who, but thanks"
16 oz can fresh
Appearance: Pours a murky honey color with a thick head that sticks nicely and leaves clumpy lacing
Bitter orange beer with moderate to light sweetness. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Very sticky head. Tastes fruity but there is a bitter orange baby aspirin finish. Tasty beer.
"Moderate pour yields a full one inch white head over a cloudy golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of sweet citrus (orange, ruby red grapefruit.) Taste of orange, orange zest, and orange pith in that order. Very nice feel in that it's a juice bomb very well carbonated. Overall, one of their best. Cheers!"
"Delicious, easy drinking IPA. A great staple to have lots of in the beer fridge"
"Of all the NEIPA’s I’ve had, this murky, muddy yellow beer has the most earthy hiding under the faint orange taste, leaving behind only a hint of like mineral water taste or something in a mighty dry finish. The nose is pretty brilliant with some spicy hops that lean orange, piney and sandy or earthy."
16 oz can poured into a teku
"Looks like a NEIPA, so it looks like it's supposed to. Can't dock them too much. Dammit."
"Most of the recent NEIPAs I've had have been DIPAs, but Orange Starfish reminds me that single IPAs can be every bit as incredible as DIPAs. Pure orange/grapefruit/mango deliciousness with just the right amount of bitterness for balance."
Can from the Brewery
Got a bunch to try from this brewery thanks to Drew. No can date.
The cloudy peach colored beer pours out from an undated can into a Duvel glass with a 1/2” creamy white head that recedes slowly (but never totally disappears) and at first leaving little lacing on the sides of the glass. However as the beer is sipped down a solid sheet of foam is left on one side of the glass. Sipping creates some web-like patches and legs of lacing.
Appearance - Pours murky orange with nice white head lots of sticky lacing lacing.
"Impossible to pick apart anything about this beer: an absolute delight in every respect. Reminded me of Tree House Julius when it was small batch, growler only, pre-cans: never been the same since."
"Amazing aroma. Very tropical and dank. Great full mouthfeel, amazing for a 5.7 abv beer. Very hazy orange appearance which I love. Really enjoyable for such low abv. Great beach beer."
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"This beer, my first from Aslin, will smack you in the face with aromas--all tropical. I know there are some beer nuts who don't like the super-cloudy, overly-hazy look, which this beer definitely has. It almost looks unfinished. But take a sip, using some olfaction and retro-olfaction and you'll forget the haze right quick. Chewy, juicy and dank, this 5.7# IPA will quench most any thirst, and with an ABV that low, it's sessionable. But it is filling, so 16 oz. might fill your tank. Very nice beer, Aslin!"
"Poured from a 16oz can into Tulips, split with Emily. Thank you Ryan for hooking me up with this long awaited want!"
Loved every sip- so well done- refreshing to have a beer with this much taste and lower ABV
"Poured from a can into a stemmed tulip. Looks like orange juice. Small white head forms. Smell is orange rind and some grapefruit. Taste is all orange rind with some lingering bitterness. Good carb and mouthfeel for a 5.7 abv IPA. Overall, excellent IPA. Really tasty!"
Can stamped 07/05/17
Aslin really impresses me with all of their beers.
"Pours a beautiful chalky off-white orange with a one finger head made up of thin bubbles. Smells of bright citrus, tropical hops and fruit, lightly sweet. Taste is a mild splash of bitterness, tropical character to boot, easy drinking with a biscuity cracker malt. Great balance. This is really a delicious and delicately made beer. Checks off all the right marks for a hazy IPA lover. Drinkability, hoppiness with subdued bitterness, creamy body, tropical character. Really impressed."
"Aroma is tropical, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, kiwi, but the taste is negatively effected by aggressive bitterness that throws off the balance. Mouth feel is light to medium. This is a decent pale, but no sense at all in trading for this."
"Poured from a can. Look is thick, hazy golden amber. Smell is citrusy/zesty. Taste is very close to orange juice. Doesn't linger in the least. Favorite Aslin so far."
Smell: huge citrus fruit orange tangerine sweet grapefruit but it's really orange forward
"Dense, opaque, peach juice appearance. Nice sweet tropical fruit nose. Taste includes oranges, peaches, orange rind, a hint of dank, slight bitter hoppy finish. Bottom line - there is a ton of flavor packed into this 5.7 ABV beer. I like this a good deal."
"Great beer! Bright hazy orange color. Couldn't get enough of the aroma. Orange, tangerine, mango, a bit of grapefruit. Taste was similar to the smell with the orange again leading the way. Some citrus and bitterness on the back end to kind of round this out. Mouthfeel was very smooth and enjoyable. Overall, I was wholeheartedly impressed with this beer! I have tried a few Aslins now and this one, along with Master of Karate, really measure up just fine with all of the popular highly-regarded Tree House/Trillium/HF gems! Very worth seeking out!"
"Fresh growler fill from the brewery, 2-10-17."
16oz can poured into a Teku.
750ml can poured into a Teku glass
"The only problem with Orange Starfish is...it's not DOUBLE Orange Starfish! Seriously though, this is a very good (and very pretty) beer, but sadly for it, I had their DIPA version first, which quite frankly blows this out of the water. Still good stuff though, no shame in silver."
"8oz pour for $4.5 at the source. Slightly hazy but not cloudy dark yellow. Looks like it may have dropped out a bit. Grapefruit and especially pine in the nose. Orange, bitter grapefruit taste with bitter pine lingering. Mouthfeel not as full as some. Just OK, thinking this is a relatively old batch."
Was my first beer from the brewery and it was amazing!!!
"32 oz crowler. Juicy n delish as expected, did not have time for detailed review."
"Super hazy and stellar lacing but looks a bit muddy. Fresh orange and wheat nose. Clean taste for how it looks. Crisp citrus. Nice richness on the feel, but a touch of water in the back. Really good beer where no one thing jumps off the page, but super enjoyable to drink."
"Poured from a crowler into a pint glass. Pours a hazy, opaque orange with a white head with excellent retention. Orange citrus on the nose, but not overwhelming. Lots of citrus on the tongue balanced out by a bit of hoppy bitterness. Full mouth feel. An excellent beer."
L- This is almost completely opaque orange. 
At the brewery on 6/18/16 (4.5 hour wait!) and crowlers later.
Fresh crowler drank on 6/29/2016
"This beer has a much better look than some of the other IPA's from Aslin, looks much more like a juice bomb you would find in NE area. I really appreciate this beer for being an easy drinking lighter ABV beer, compared with some of other 8%+ IPAs and DIPAs out there. This is straight up hopped orange juice and if available, i could drink it everyday. This beer has come along way since the first batch. It was a very nice beer for their first attempt at a hazy, NE style juice bomb but it finished a little boring. Nice and crisp and clean, but this beer has improved leaps and bounds. Mouthfeel is great, the nose is juicy and full of citrus and now it finishes with that hint of sweet that balances the hops that make you smack your lips and want to go back in for more."
"cloudy mango color, foam resting at the top is thick and pillowy its a beautiful looking beer, you can't see through any part of this. Smells like heaven, they really nailed down the hops here. Immediately it reminds me of Green from Tree House, I'd be interested if the hop profile is close to that. It really pops on the aroma, its perfect again! Taste is almost par with the perfect nose, tons of guava/mango and a nice tiny bitter bite at the end to finish off on the swallow. Reminds meow Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street from Trillium. This thing is insane, just so damn tasty. I honestly have no interest in over-hyping any of these up ""New England"" style IPAs that are starting to pop up left and right.. plus I live over 1500 miles away but this is the real deal."
"L: Soft orange, honeycomb and apricot hues with an ample white head and substantial lacing"
"Poured cold from a 32 oz crawler, consumed the day after canning in a Teku glass."
"Look is a gorgeous hazy glowing yellowish orange - as far as hazy beers go, this is pretty great, especially compared to the admittedly gross-looking Master of Karate. Smell is nice tropical fruits, if not a bit subdued. Taste is rather subdued, not nearly as juicy and tropical tasting as I would have expected based on the aroma. Feel was lacking too, carbonation was probably too low and the slick and coating mouthfeel that seems to be present in all Aslin beers is just a huge turnoff for me. Ultimately, that's what really knocks these beers down for me."
"32 oz crowler from 6/18/16 poured into Aslin Teku glass, cause I'm the kind of guy who wears the team jersey to the game."
"Another incredible beer from Aslin. Having this and their Master of Karate, I'm convinced that they are the next brewery to beat. Their general flavor profile is a cross between Tired Hands and Treehouse. This particular one is close to perfect, juicy, citrus-y, full-bodied, and so incredibly flavorful all around."
"Pours hazy cloudy orange out of the crowler. From afar I am getting huge notes of juicy oranges, tangerine, other dank fruit notes. Once I get it close the notes are so much more pronounced. Total juice bomb with a fluffy mouthfeel. Not much bitterness and its ridiculously crushable. Get it."
This is the best one I have had from aslin so far. Tons of juice and very little bitterness but still a lot of hop flavors. Easily could have finished the whole growler myself.
They can't seem to keep enough of this around. I like this more than their master of karate. Fantastic flavor coming through on this. I can't wait for the next release of this.
"In my opinion this is better than julius, such a soft creamy mouth feel. Lots of citrus and orange on the nose. Good orange pith type bitterness, tons of juiciness following the slight bitterness. Its a phenomenal beer for how low abv it is. Just a killer killer beer."
"Had this blind side by side with some other people with some trillium and treehouse stuff. It was near unanimous that this was preferred to julius. I cant believe a brewery that has been around for 6 months can produce brews this good. Its a Orange juice bomb. Nose is outstanding orange, mango, tropical fruits, pineapple. Haze for fucking days, if you blindly gave this beer to anyone and didnt tell them what it was they would expect it was a TreeHouse beer. Outstanding all around beer."
"I'll be the first to admit that some of the Aslin IPAs/DIPAs are overhyped and overrated. This is not one of them. Orange Starfish and Bringing Sexy Back are both truly world class IPAs and some of the best beers (maybe THE best beers) brewed in the DC area. Brewed in the NE style, it's insanely hazy with a chewy mouthfeel. The nose is all citrus and the flavor is incredibly juicy with a little bit of bitterness, making for a very drinkable beer. I loved how flavorful this was despite being only 5.7%."
"This beer is a true New England style unfiltered IPA. OJ ""turbid"" look in the glass with nice creamy head. Smell is nice but actually a little subdued. Taste is spot on amazing. Juicy and sweet from the hops and no bitterness in the finish. Really nice. Aslin IPAs are the real deal and is the top game in town in the Mid-Atlantic area for IPAs."
The beer pours a nice white and creamy head that dissipates moderately. The beer itself is a very cloudy yellow color with all the sediment that gets left in the beer for a New England style IPA. It's a very nice look and strongly resembles orange juice but is a shade darker that it has a nice orange shade to it.
Revisited 2/2/18
IPA's aren't normally my thing but Orange Starfish is amazing. I've tried Treehouse stuff (Alter Ego and Bright) and Orange Starfish is a bigger juice bomb.
This is probably my favorite IPA from Aslin to date. Pours a bright orange hazy color with thin white lacy head. Nose is full of citrus and pineapple. Flavor is the same with some crisp pine. Mouthfeel is full for a 6% beer and rounded our bitterness at the end. Overall this is pretty close to perfect IMO.
"From a growler, pours a totally hazed, rich yellow-orange. Full on OJ mode. Nice 2-finger dense white head that takes a while to go down. "
Here we go again. Pour from a growler filled at Aslin yesterday.
"Creamsicle orange color with thick white head. Aroma of mango, pineapple, pine, citrus, and guava. Huge thick mouthfeel for the win! Taste is great too, tons do tropical juries with low perceived bitterness. Overall this may be my favorite from Aslin!"
"I find this beer more ripe than the day is long. Wake up and want it. I dream. Dream and believe, I can for as long as I can see. Believe, drink, drink, believe... I take another sip, can I last I to reality? Is reality more real than me? I drink. I believe. Yes, I believe."
"Thanks, Chris!"
First one from moonraker. I’m an instant fan. It hits on every note. Easily crushable. Extremely well balanced throughout. Look forward to more from them.
"Had this on tap at the brewery. Such an amazing beer! An easy drinker, lots of depth and isn’t overly juicy or bitter. Lots of citrusy orange, soft pineapple, grapefruit, and a touch of stone fruit."
"Lots of people will tell you in the ""Saa-kraa-menn-O"" area that this is the best of this style we have around here. And while they are right me personally am not as big a fan as most , a definite must buy if you see it or drive to Auburn and taste it yourself. You will appreciate this beer more if you had some wack ones of this genre. I'm not a person that's crazy about the haze."
Phenomenal beer. Highest recommendation. Look at the line around Moonraker when this beer is released and it should convince you I’m not alone in my rating. My wife was a Coors Light fan but Yojo has changed her life. She never liked the taste of any IPA and she absolutely loves Yojo.
"A glass of cloudy white grapefruit juice with a fluffy white head that fades but leaves a wind band of lacing. Bubbles continue to rise from the nucleation site of the glass throughout the drink. Nice scents of flowers, grapefruit, sweet malt and pine are noticeable. The taste is mostly bitter grapefruit pith and pine up front with a nice wave of mild sweetness and flowers at the end. Nice body and creamy mouthfeel in this beer. This is a really fine beer."
Canned 7/7/17; drank 7/21/17 @ the Yarchives. 
My first offering from Moonraker poured into a TH goblet glass.
"Pours a hazy turbid bright straw yellow.nice frothy white head that laces the glass the whole way down. The nose is like a fruit basket! Fresh cut pinnaple, peaches, apricots and ripe mangos. The taste is spectacular! Extremely bright and extremely fresh. Fresh pineapple juice, peach and apricot nectar along with ripe mangos and grasses. Not overly sweet like the nose and taste might suggest but nonetheless you do pick up a solid amount from the fresh bouquet of fruits. Bitterness is just right, not extreme but enough hoppy kick to keep things interesting. Mouthfeel is smooth, rounded and somewhat creamy. Finishes crisp and very clean on your palate. You almost need to take the next sip as the flavor explosion that happens with every swig disappears quickly. This one can be dangerous as at 7% she is extremely drinkable. I absolutely love Yojo! This beer is my Jam! Cheers"
A: cloudy straw yellow haze. medium white bubbles.
"Like James Bond, this beer is all smooth flavor and good looks. Dank with tons of floral and stone fruit flavors, finishes cleaner than a Walther PPK."
"This is pretty much the beer that put Moonraker on the map. Pours a shady yellow NE ipa broth with a thin 1/5"" white head. Aroma is pungently tropical and citrus. Plenty of stone and tropical fruits here, with a soft exterior on the nose."
"pours a hazy yellowish orange, reminds me of a Mimosa. "
"Amazing NE style IPA! Nose bursts forth, tons of fruit!"
"Tropical tropical tropical. Muted yellow in appearance, sweet nose full of fruits, tastes of citrus rinds with grapefruit and mellon, unexpectedly great mouthfeel."
Can shared by jc1762. Thanks Jon.
Type: 16-oz. can 
"The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color, completely murky."
"Had cans from both batch 1 and 2, both are fantastic. Golden hazy color with a bright tropical aroma. Definitely get the juice up front plus a nice mellow hop bite, super full body with a soft finish. Top tier NE style IPA, totally on par with anything else being put out around the US."
Poured into a large cabernet glass.
"L: Hazy orange, apricot, and honeycomb hues with an ample white head"
"Draught pour at their tasting room into a tulip. Looks like orange juice with a finger of white high density head that dissipates quickly and left spider web lacing. Nose is competing tropical and citrus, tropical wins by a nose. Taste is almost inverted, citrus dominates with tropical falling into the background. Finish is dry, very astringent, minimal bitterness, and lingers a bit. Mouthfeel is tingly from the astringency and some acidity, carbonation medium. Still needs work on softening the mouthfeel a bit, perhaps it's better from a can after a week or two. Solid beer, hope I can catch it canned sometime. Right now I prefer part Duex."
"No canned on date, but quite fresh, direct from the brewery"
"holy cow. in the shadows of knee deep brewing is moonraker. these guys are keeping great GREAT things on the down low. i had the Yojo on tap at the brewery. cloudy, pine, citrus and super smooth. quite possibly my favorite IPA at the moment. the Yojo and all its variants are excellent beers. if you have never heard of moonraker you NEED to go check them out. Heck after hitting knee deep you can just WALK down to moonraker Brewing. +1 for auburn breweries!"
Out here in California it's rare to find or try any of the awesome New England/East coast IPAs. Moonraker is the only brewery in northern California (or all of California for that matter) to make something close to this style of beer. I was super excited when I heard that their YOJO was in fact a New England style IPA. 
Looks like grapefruit juice and tastes super juicy and also very tastey!
"You only juice once(Yojo) pours a hazy yellowish orange,looks like juice in the glass. The aroma is out of this world, it's orange juice, pineapple juice,sherbet ice cream. The taste follows the nose exactly so much tropical fruit juice, this take on a ne style ipa is dead on"
Appearance: Pours very cloudy and pear nectar colored with a one finger cap; good retention and splashy lacing
"On tap at Beer Shop, NYC."
Simply outstanding DIPA. Smooth haze with tons of flavor and finesse. Love Galaxy hops and this one didn't disappoint! Big thanks to @leedszimbabwe for the hookup
Can from 10/6/18 release. Poured into Belgian tulip.
Pours hazy New England style ipa. Minimal head.
Poured from a 32 oz growler into a teku glass.
"L - pours an impenetrably thick yeasty yellow haze. Like a sandstorm in my glass. Usually some light makes it through a beer of this color, but not today."
DDH Space Diamonds - Other Half
Pours cloudy golden with big two finger white head. Great lacing which holds it place on the snifter. Aroma of pineapple. Taste follows the nose with orange juice and citrus.
Tall can.......12/6/17 (just over a month in the can)
Wow! This is amazing. The hype is real.
pineapple sweetness cut with citrus hops. look is an incredible hazy yellow.
Not my favorite from OH but solid DDH IPA. Could have just been too green will try again this weekend!
"Really nice brew. Loads of pineapple in this hazy beer. Starts off candy sweet and finishes very dry, hanging on for quite some time. Very enjoyable"
"Poured from a can into a tulip glass. I didn't look at the can date, but this is probably a 3 month old beer."
"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma has bright fruity hops, pears, lemondrop. Taste is juicy and creamy with sweet fruits and tropical notes. Really nice NE style DIPA."
16oz. can into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Quite simply perfection in a can. Without a doubt the best beer OH has ever brewed and I personally don't think it's close (besides Citra Daydream). This is like a souped up version of Proclamation Derivative w/ Galaxy. Can't wait til this is released again! Truly excellent.
Can shared by Matthew. Thank you!
All of this beer is great on all levels but nothing over the top! Definitely a world class beer though!
On tap at Other Half. Pours a super hazy pale yellow color with almost no head. Almost looks like a glass of grapefruit juice. Some lacing. Nose is tons of Galaxy hops. Berries and fruity with some dank notes. The taste is the mostly the stone fruits. Some melon and pineapple. Not nearly as boozey as expected. Pineapple and lemon/lime finish. Light mouthfeel with low carbonation.
"Cloudy opaque pour, good sized head, lots of lace. Dank and fruity up front, papaya, mango, weed, softer guava notes. Medium body. Smooth."
"This beer is insanely delicious. It pours a murky gold with next to no head and zero lacing, this it's all good from there. The smell is a mix of pineapple, lemon and a touch of melon. This beer is beyond juicy, and is elite in that regard, rivaling some of the very best NEIPAs, not the wannabes. Lots of pineapple, a hint of honeydew melon stand out for me. This is galaxy hops at its absolute finest. The Feel is so goddamn soft, and surprisingly well carbed despite the lousy head. Nice amount of bitterness. It also literally makes your mouth water. I could drink way to many of these if I was given the opportunity. This is a heavy contender for my favorite OH beer, and definitely one of the best overall beers I've had."
"Looks like grapefruit juice with a big foam head that leaves lace lines behind... Aromas of sweet tropical fruits with citrusy accents predominate... Sweet and juicy, bringing impressions of fresh pineapple, orange creamsicles, and rich melon. Smooth, soft, plush and lush - amply carbonated, medium-weight but airy... Bursting with deliciousness... blurry canning date, but presumably 5/26/17..."
"once again, thank you to davidsoul. beer pours like murky fresh squeezed hop juice. this beer is a full on galaxy hop overdose. seriously though, this beer takes me back to the days of my pre-instarone palate that couldn't handle a heavy dose of hops. as someone who regularly laughs at the folks claiming a beer needs some time to get into the right spot....well I might be coming around on this whole climate change thing cause hot dog if I don't feel that this beer needs a little time to dehoppify itself. not that it is bad...it's just too much. I'm drowning in galaxy here."
Thank you CanConPhilly for this
"maybe a bit biased by my love for a good galaxy IPA, but damn this is delicious. cloudy as portland, tasty as all hell."
"Look- Color is a cloudy beige, pours two fingers of thick, pillowy foam that retains wonderfully."
On tap at Haymaker. From notes. Reviewed 17 January 2017.
On tap at EBF.
"First had 2/4/17 at Extreme Beer Fest. One of the only lines I waited in was Other Half. This smells of tropical hops. Flavor is juicy bitterness, orange, peach, and grapefruit. It was turbid and hazy, and I can see why it generates long waits!"
"Canned 1/13/17, drinking my last one 2/8/17. Pours a vibrant hazy golden peachy orange, with minimal head but wow that's an excellent color. This one has improved over the last month too. At first it was too much of a juice bomb, the original on steroids with no balance. Now some balance has arrived, but I still think I enjoyed the original better. Strong notes of grapefruit and pineapple, orange juice. The yeast is showing character now after 4 weeks and it's a nice element to the beer."
Canned on 1/13/17 (Planet Express). Enjoyed on 2/7/17. Acquired in a trade for Treehouse King JJJuliusss.
"Pours a hazy bold orange with a one finger head. You can smell this beer from across the room. Citrus bath, pineapple, guava, sweet fruit. Taste is bitter and tropical creamsicle. Smooth. Great example of a clear cut DIPA with the NE style rounding out the bitterness. Mouthfeel is chewy and thick like biting into a peach. This is a deluxe and delicious DIPA."
Sample at EBF Saturday.
"This was yet another beer that I stood in line for in front of Other Half, with the hopes that this would be even better than what I've had from them. One whiff of the beer upon cracking the gorgeous can open here at home was all I needed to prove that yes, this was worth the wait and the hype, even after having so much from them over the last year and change!"
"tons of tropical, mango lychee and berries. "
Hazy yellow. White head.
"L - hazy, pretty much opaque, light orange, head fades pretty quickly"
Appearance: Pours a cloudy butterscotch color with a one finger head; splashy patterns of lacing emerge
"L - super-dense, offwhite head atop a murky orange body."
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant grapefruit and citrus. Taste is also a very pleasant grapefruit and citrus.
"Hazy, light orange, with a pillowy head. Smells sweet and boozy with orange and grapefruit with some pith and pine. Tastes really sweet and really bitter with tons of citrus and floral flavors. This is a pretty great beer."
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a fairly hazy golden color with a frothy bleached white head of 2 cm foaming up with a gentle pour. The foam fades to a sturdy surface layer with some tight lacing on the sides of the glass. 
"Poured into a snifter. A hazy/turbid yellow-acorn color with a modest white head. Nice retention. Aroma is there but not noticeable until I took a whiff. Mainly orange and citrus, with some earthy resin. Moderately bitter and soft feeling, with bright orange, tropical fruit, and a nice dank resiny balance. There was a slight astringency on the finish, but ABV well hidden. Outstanding."
"Thanks to cp45 for this can, among others, that arrived yesterday in a wonderful Christmas-like box. 16 oz. can split with my wife. "
Poured from a can into glass. Poured thick gold color. Limited aroma (after several beers). Taste began as east coast ipa but finished like a west coast. A bit over rated.
"Another very solid NEIPA from Aslin. A little muted in aroma and flavor IMO. Maybe 10 days old from canning date is old? Not sure. Anyway, its still a great beer from Aslin. Can't really go wrong with any of their NEIPAs they make."
"Pours a fully thick, chalky/hazy orange with a two finger head of fine bubbles. Aroma is pungent right from the opening of the can, fruity tropical juice, pineapple, orange, sweet and floral. Taste matches nose in tropical character, subdued bitterness, creamy mouthfeel, slightly chewy. Balanced and nice, but I'd love to try a fresh can as this is my first time having this beer and it's about a month and a half old. The hype does live up though, from this NE IPA out of Aslin."
16 oz can poured into nonic pint.
Can: Poured a cloudy orangey color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrusy and grapefruit hoppy undertones with light tropical fruit notes. Taste is also a mix of tropical notes with some citrusy and grapefruit notes with a somewhat spicy finish. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid NEIPA but subtle spicy finish didn’t work with me.
"No canned on date, but assumed fresh"
A big thanks goes out to Craig for this one.
"Got this in a trade a little more than a month ago and it was frozen upon receiving. Doesn’t matter. Loooks, smells, tastes, feels, amazing. Love it! Wish I had more!"
Another one thanks to Drew. No can date
Overly hyped. Love Aslin but this isn’t their best
Can from the brewery. I prefer the DDH version
Underwhelmed. For being 8.4% (lower than many other Aslin DIPAs) abv the alcohol comes through surprisingly aggressively. There is a good amount of tropical and citrus fruit flavor but overall the balance is not that great.
Cloudy sunshine in a bottle. Seems to peak a week or two after canned.
Can (12/16 release)
Appearance - Pours bright orange color with thick soapy white head with lots of lacing all around the glass.
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass. No can date, but it's from mid November. "
16oz can poured into a snifter
"Poured a cloudy orange body with good head and lace. The aroma is acidic with a prevalent orange juice-like smell. Bitter, sharp, acidic, crisp hop flavors that are earthy and bitter with an oily orange flavor and then hints of sweetness like tangerine and a touch of booze in the finish."
L - Orange/tan and hazy with two fingers of fluffy white head that clings to the glass creating lots of lacing.
"Finally had my chance to have it at Aslin's 2nd anniversary and it did not disappoint. Just an all-around superb DIPA. It's unfortunate that its so hard to come by, but you really must try and get it if you can."
Thanks goes out to cjgiant for this brew.
"This beer was very good although, not world class like i thought it would be. Granted i it was 2 months old when i had it. That probably makes a little difference. still great. the haze and color were grapefruit like."
"Poured from a 16oz can into Tulips, split with Emily. Thank you Ryan for hooking me up with this long awaited want!"
Excellent. Not too bitter or hop spicy. Goes down very smooth. The aroma is subtle but the taste is pure orange/tangerine.
"This will karate kick your mouth into IPA juice bomb heaven. Smooth tropical fruits, mango, kiwi, hint of banana."
"Phenomenal brew. Hazy AF...milkshake like. Looks like a thick beer. Smells of melon...lots of melon. Taste is orange, melon and some Amarillo bitterness. Very nice. Drinks thicknfor a DIPA. Very creamy. Outstanding beer here. One of the best non NE IPAs I've had."
"I'd start with talking about the mouth feel on this beer. It is the best mouth feel I've ever had on an IPA. The best IPA I've had outside of New England. Smells good, nice regular IPA look, but the taste is amazing and you can just swish it in your mouth it is really really good."
Canned 2-22-17
"So good. Cloudy and thick. Color is a little dirty, but taste is big citrus. A little bitter aftertaste. Excellent!"
For my money this is the best NE style IPA brewed outside of Vermont. So well balanced that it effortlessly delivers the hop crane kick to the face without breaking a sweat.
"Hazy amber, brownish orange... smells like peaches, blueberry, and citrus. Beautiful fruity flavor - tropical, passion fruit, some sweetness from the malts, bitterness on the back with a bubblegum yeast. Juicy and fizzy, somewhat dry finish."
"L - Murky, dirty orange"
"From the bottom of the can: ""WEIRD MUGGER GUY 02/22/17 10:36:38"""
This was good for sure.
Met the hype. Deep hazy opaque burnt orange color with massive lasting head. Grapefruit peach and passion fruit nose and taste. Full and smooth mouth feel. Thanks Myles for the trade!
Poured from a 750 ml bottle (bottled 12/22/2016) into Aslin Beer house glass. 
Poured from a bomber.
"Very cloudy orange body with a thick, frothy white head. Aroma and flavor are both that of a fruit smoothie. Tropical fruits, kiwi, all types of fruity goodness. Feel is smoothie-like too; medium body with medium carbonation and a creamy feel. Awesome NE style fruity hop bomb."
Shared by Jon. Bubblegum scent. Quite sweet with a lingering aftertaste.
Bottle shared by Matthew. Many thanks!
"Crowler courtesy of Nichols. Thank dude! This was a proper NE IPA. Great tropical nose and flavors. I can not and will not ever give hazy AF beers a great visual score, at least this was more like cloudy sunshine vs. brown murk. But this was a proper NE IPA from VA and had great, smooth, juicy hop flavor."
Juice bomb that can complete with any NE IPA. Fantastic beer that will put Aslin on the craft beer map soon!
Outstanding opaque New England juice bomb. Heady aromas of tropical fruit and west coast citrusy hops. Taste follows the smell but with even more of a depth to the hop character. Solid malt backbone to provide enough body to allow such a heavy assault of hops.
"32 oz crowler. Pours vivid orange, hazy, thick white head fades slowly, scattered lace. Tropical naval orange aroma. Super juicy taste, orange mostly, but not overly sweet. Great hop finish, citrus peel and mild weediness, just right level of bitter. Excellent balance. Full creamy soft feel stands out. Top notch IPA."
Canned last 9/29. Picked this up last night at the release. Poured into a tulip
Look: Hazy and opaque like orange juice
Good beer outta VA here
"Crowler share thanks to Steve. Pours out a murky orange golden color capped with a fluffy beige head. Aroma is mildly floral and citrusy , some sweet malts. Taste follows the same pattern., leaning towards the NE style"
"The thickest, muddiest looking IPA I've ever seen. Color isn't mud. Bronzed milk. Thin head that lingers well. Malty nose. Clean. Dank citrus mixed in. Taste is like the nose. Not much more to add. Very nice feel. Carbed and yet smooth. Overhyped but still quite good. Grows on you. Strong well crafted malt backbone with good hops."
Did a cuvée with this that was tasty
Fresh crowler drank in an Aslin teku on 6/29/2016
"This is a hazy bomb! So deliciously smooth. I consider myself a Tree House regular and this bad boy is right on it. I dont want to make this a Tree House comparison review, since every brewery is its own identity, but this stuff is Tree House-esque. It smells like Julius but less dank. It has a hazier thicker body, it is a double. The mid is the only part that needs a tad bit of refinement. The finish is excellent sweet mango papaya. Better as it warms a bit, but still drink cold. Outstanding and world class. Seek out a taste if you can, its going to get a lot tougher to get ahold of."
Hazy yellow orange. Off white head.
Almost as ugly as hoof hearted beers- the beer tastes wonderful!
"Crowler purchased at brewery on June 18, day of release. 2.5 hour wait and I see down the review line someone waited 2 hours longer than that! Our little Aslin is growing up. Poured into Aslin Teku glass."
At the brewery on Saturday (4.5 hour wait!) then poured from crowler later.
"An abomination to look at. Looks like somebody combined a can of chicken broth with some orange juice. Smelled like an IPA, tasted like an IPA. Flavor is what you would expect when you hop-burst with galaxy and mosaic."
"crowler filled 6/18 at brewery. no offense to this hazy/turbid style (of which I usually enjoy) but I've seen pond water that looked more appetizing than this one. taste was decent but it had this weird slickness to the mouthfeel that was just plain weird, nothing like any other non-stout I've ever had. only barely better than the Neutrino they also had on that day."
"it's possibly been 10 years since I felt the need to review a beer. In that time I've frustratingly observed many other American markets far outside Northern Virginia/DC metro (looking at your New England) crank out marquee beers while we lagged behind with ""good"" but never great IPAs. Master of Karate, I can confidently say is a world class beer. The nose, the rich opaque unfiltered orange glow, the substantive mouthfeel...and holy ****, the juiciness. I know that's what everyone focuses on, but that's for a reason. These guys manage to nail the style so well. I can't find a fault here. Maybe this will prompt me to review more beers, but man am I sold on Aslin..."
Just an incredible juice bomb.
"Had Aslin Beers for the first time this Saturday. Hard to believe that this is from the Mid-Atlantic, specifically DMV area. Until now I'd say that Dogfish 60 minute was my favorite local IPA."
Poured cold from a 32 oz. crawler into a tulip glass; consumed the night of the release.
"murky haze, darker than most hazy IPAs I've had. muddled tropical smell with slight pine, taste followed. where it really lacked for me was mouthfeel - sticky and coated my mouth too much, and not as much carbonation as I would have liked. good but not great."
Out this world Juicy Double IPA. Excellent NE style that I am use to. Hazy color and fruity smells coming pouring at you from beginning to end. Beautiful combination of everything I look for.
"A top notch juicy IPA. Hops to the face and to the nuts. I've had the juiciest of the juicy NE style IPA, and this gives Tree House, Trillium and all the others a run for their money. If in the DC area, do yourself a favor and stop by."
"Pours an entirely hazy, dark amber-orange color, with a huge head, revealing lots of tiny bubbles."
"Fresh from the source, Pours a light orange hazy color with thick white lacy head. Nose has pine, and mosaic with hints of berry, passionfruit and citrus. Flavor is the same with a huge mouthfeel. Overall this beer is fantastic."
"Poured from a 32oz crowler. Such an amazing IIPA from Aslin - probably the best IIPA they have to offer. Straight tropical smell with a great smooth mouthfeel. Just like your typical NE style IPA, this has a nice hazy, orange color. Looking forward to future batches."
"Tracked this one down through a trade partner after it broke the top 250....nice orange, juicy DIPA with great juicy hops character! Will definitely be looking for more from Aslin!"
"This is a beautiful beer in every aspect, hence a perfect 5 from me. Juicy, tropical, long lingering resinous bitterness that was just about perfect. Outstanding mouthfeel, beautiful orange color (drank at night in the dark with LED light, but it has the prettiest color of all the beers we had). This is one of the few that I will be trading for again and again."
"Poured from a crowler - thanks, Matt for the opportunity"
"Pours a orangish yellow malty color. Smells like tropical fruit hops. Nice smooth mango, orange, pineapple taste with a nice hop and malt balance. Man this is a wonderful beer."
Look: Cloudy opaque orange juice
Simply amazing. This brewery is doing it right.
"Beautiful beer really, a nice frothy head with nice lacing."
"Great beer. Tons of hop character. I you like them murky and hoppy, this beer is for you. Well done by Aslin. I think this is my favorite IPA from them."
Fresh growler fill into my teku glass. Hazy with foamy white head. Getting mango and tropical notes. Wow! Juicy in every sense. Very drinkable with no alcohol trace. Very impressed.
"One of the best DIPA's I've had. Lots of mango and some citrus zest and pith. Thr mouthfeel is outstanding, very creamy. Finish is dry with some bitterness but very easy drinking for ABV. Aslin is killing it"
Wow - another homerun from Aslin. MoK can rival any NE juice bomb. Pours an amazing hazy orange with great citrus and tropical notes. I cannot wait for my next opportunity to try this terrific beer again!
"Drank 12 oz glass from 10 day old 64 oz growler. Carb was avg-low with thin lace line after head settled for 5 min. Produced an initial 1/2 inch of bright white head after easy pour. Color was a burnt cloudy orange. I was hoping for a brighter orange, but so is everyone these days with NE IPAs. Nice haze, thought it would settle out after 10 days, but no. Super strong hop forward taste, minimal hop after taste, but monster aroma on the nose and in each sip on tongue throughout the beer. Very drinkable for the abv. I thought twice about cracking this growler due to top 25 status, but the hop profile becoming less floral and more bitter as this has aged- glad I did! So I'm gonna finish this bitch so I can fill it with Mind The Hop. Totally recommend drinking this from the tap, at their bar, on release date to maximize floral hop forward profile. We are blessed to have Aslin in our community making this style of beer. You guys are killing it! Please make more so I may buy the max IPA limit. Also, your Crowlers are straight cash homie!"
"This is straight mango juice. Looks like tangerine juice, hazy, opaque, orange. It is a juice bomb the second it hits your nose, mango and tropical fruits. One of the best DIPAs I have had in a while, its so juice and 0 bitterness."
"Poured out of a growler two days after brewery fill. Very hazy unfiltered look. Fantastic tropical nose -- mango and maybe pineapple - does not fade as the beer sits in the glass. Taste has some definite grapefruit, but in a more mellow way than West Coast IPAs -- say like Sculpin. The grapefruit lingers for a while. Nice carbonation and mouth feel. Drinks more like a regular IPA than a DIPA. "
A very good beer. It has a very good taste. It goes down very smooth. It is one of their better beers! This beer is definitely worth a trip to the brewery!
Im in love with this beer. It is so smooth and juicy. Mango-y Orange juice and you cannot tell it is 8.4% but it doesnt over cover the ABV it just tastes great!
"Just wow!! Master of Karate is an amazing NE-style IPA that I would stack up against anything. Very juicy, perfectly hopped, and refreshing. They guys at Aslin are doing a killer job."
"Drank on tap at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA"
"Has to be my favorite beer they have done. Haze for days, juice bomb. Orange, papaya, melon, pineapple, mango hit you on the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy and taste follows the nose, nice mango and orange pith. No bitterness at all. This is a stellar juicebomb DIPA that can hang with the big NE ipas. These guys are killing it right now."
My favorite ipa they've done so far. Insanely juicey and smooth. Love the hazy look and great feel. Hard to believe it is 8%.
This beer definitely proves that Aslin is making or en route to making world class IPAs. Total juicd bomb and extremely balanced. Very minimal malt backbone and almost no booze at all....all juice. Absolutely fantastic and very well balanced. This gives the best of the NE IPAs a run for their money.
"Born and raised in DC, I've been waiting for a place like Aslin for quite some time. This is the third offering I've tried and it was my favorite yet. It has that NE feel to it (look and taste) and is a total juice bomb. The difference between Karate and the other two I've had is that it finishes so well. Aslin is still new and they have nowhere to go but up. I can't wait to continue trying their beer!"
"Pours a very hazy dark orange with a half-finger of off-white foam. Decent lacing. Smell and tastes very tropical and fruity--mango, pineapple, orange and ripe melon--with a layer of dank, spicy pine underneath. Bit of yeasty dough flavor on the finish before a modest piney bitterness takes it out. Feel is a rich, full medium, with a smoothness that's cut with prickly carbonation. "
"Revisit can dated 8/22, comparing notes to original review on tap:"
"March 2018: Murky light orange, decent lacing. Nose of mange, melon, pine - dank, resinous notes are more prominent now. Flavor is more of the same with spicy mango, pine needle, some tropical fruit and a light grassiness with a touch of earthy bitterness on the back end (that detracts). Chewy mouthfeel, low bitterness, perhaps a bit too thick (!?), if that's possible. Great DIPA, but I mostly prefer the smaller hoppy beers in the 6-7% range. (4.34)"
Beer is a deep yellow. Opaque with a nice unfiltered look. Bits of hops are visible but not too much. Very appealing look. Almost like orange juice.
"One of Aslin's newest DIPA! This may be my favorite of the two they released in the past week. The hops give this beer a huge noise and juice of mango, passionfruit, and pine. Nice hazy orange color. Love the full mouthfeel too!"
On-tap at Aslin.
"Fresh from the source, got a crowler of it too! Pours a light orange hazy color with thick white lacy head. Nose has pine, funk, dank from the galaxy and mosaic with hints of berry, passionfruit and citrus. Flavor is the same with a huge mouthfeel. Overall this beer is fantastic."
"I'm very impressed by this. A super juice bomb a la Treehouse. Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy. Luscious mango and orange nose. The mouthfeel is sticky and substantial. The flavor doubles down on the orange juice and mango. Reminds me a bit of a fruitier and less vegetal Green. All around, holds it own with the big boys. Make the trek. This is worth it."
"On tap at the source. A big, assertive New England style brew. All the necessary flavors are present but it really backhands you with initial hop tang. One of, if not the best beer I enjoyed during an excursion to Portland."
Tastes exactly like the juice box I used to have as a child. Wait.. was I drinking beer as a child?
Had from crowler from brewery on 7.21.18
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma has dextrin malt, sweet vanilla and juicy hops. Taste is sweet and fruity with dank/sweaty hops and low bitterness."
Released 5/12/18; drank 5/22/18 @ the Yarchives. 
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a great fruit and hops blend. Taste is also a nice blend of fruit and hops.
"This brew is so Mosaic, YCH might as well rewrite their hop profile description for it based on this beer. An orgasmic aromatic blend of candied mango, bubble gum, sweet tangerine peels, dried grass and some more candied fruit get right up to your face and all up in it. The candied mango and the grass prove more tenacious than rest of the elements as you let the brew sit, but the aroma admirably remains consistent throughout the entire drinking experience."
"Opaque yellow-tan with a thick, creamy blanket dying to a soft collar."
crowler dated 5/19/17
Everything it's advertised to be.
Crowler canned 11/16/2016. Shipped from Oregon to Colorado a couple weeks ago and kept cold in the fridge to settle.
"32oz crowler, served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy medium yellow-orange body, one finger white head, plenty of carbonation and effervescence; super hazy with good retention and bits of lacing. Smells of massive orange and grapefruit juice; great juiciness quotient behind a minimal cereal malt backbone. This smells pretty much what you'd expect. Flavour is a rich juicy orange and grapefruit bite, with a light resin and grassy bitterness on the backend, which is pretty minimal. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, smooth with such a great juicy finish. Hell of a juicy beer; it's pretty much capturing the extreme of the juicy IPA, it's almost bordering on ridiculous. Still, this is damn tasty and I enjoyed this a metric ton."
"Showed up to the brewery with my growler wanting to get it filled. Was told they don't do growler fills (the fuck?) and got a crowler instead (only take home option). They pulled it out of the fridge (wasn't even canned on demand, like every other crowler I've ever gotten) and the can didn't have a date on it. Who knows how old it was. Beer itself is fairly smooth for how high of an abv it is. Smells quite citrusy, possibly the best ipa ive ever smelled. Initially juicy, but has a stale aftertaste that I can't get past. Could be because of the crowler dodginess. Doesn't live up to the hype for me. But it's a solid imperial."
Golden orange color. On tap at the brewpub.
"Aroma: Juicy, bit of biscuity, dank, "
"Had several pours at the Saraveza IIPA fest this year. The lacing is wonderful. Hazy orange look to it with minimal head. Beautiful aromas coming out of this one - papaya, mango, all the classic juicy IPA traits. This is on par with any other juicy IIPAs I have had. wonderful."
"Had this on tap when I was up there this past weekend and drinking a crowler of it now. I just don't know if you can make a better IPA than this. Pours hazy as hell and looks like a cross between mango juice and honey. A one finger white head fluffs up pretty nicely before settling down to a thin ring. Aroma is a juice grenade. Tons of mango, orange sorbet and just a dash of pine resin way way in the back. Taste is every bit as good as the smell and maybe better. Tons of mango, orange pith and light pink grapefruit with just a touch of grapefruit pith and caramel on the finish. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. This is goddamn near perfect."
"On tap at the brewery, Portland. "
"Draft and Crowler from the brewpub recently.. hazy light orange.. the brew delivers on the promise and has bunches of citrus and tropical fruitiness.. grapefruit, tangerine, mango and passionfruit are up front and unapologetic.. dig this one."
32 oz. crowler. Incredibly tropical aroma just when opening the can. Hazy orange body. Smell is all tropical fruit hops. Mango especially. Taste is juicy and tropical up front. Strong mango. Turns into a peach nectar flavor. Sweet. Low bitterness in the back end. Medium to medium heavy. This is absolutely delicious.
On tap at the brewery. 
"Hazy pour (read: not 100% opaque like many of the newer hazy IPAs). Melon, orange, peach in the nose. Taste follows with a punch of bitterness to keep it from becoming a sweet beer. Mouthfeel is soft with a slight carb'ed bite. Awesome beer!"
"This place deserves more attention asap. So much more aroma and flavor compared to Treehouse and Trillium hops. My fave was Juice Box, followed by Juice Jr and Ripe (in that order). Slightly bitterer than NE IPAs"
"Reminds me of an Alpine Nelson - same look, smell, and taste. "
"Lovely, yellow-orange color. The smell is all citrus and orange juice. The taste is full of the citrusy notes of the hops with just the right enough of bitterness to remind you that this is still an IPA. I hope to see this around more places!"
On tap at the brewpub the other night.
"I must start by saying that I had extremely high expectations for this one given the hype. Looks exactly like a NE IPA should, gorgeous and hazy. Aroma was absolutely incredible, a mango peach punch to the face. The taste was good, tons of mango, peach and pineapple. Definitely hides the ABV well. I would have preferred a touch more bitterness even for the style. The mouthfeel was slightly watery, could have used a bit more body. Overall, aside from those minor flaws (nitpicking really), this is a great take on the NE IPA."
"Looks kinda funny, then when you realize it looks just like it tastes, beautiful. Dank, ridiculous, hop aroma, juicy hop mouthfeel. Nice fruit in this one, some ripe grapefruit, pineapple. I'm really enjoying these juicy IPAs. Highlighting the fruitiness of the hops while keeping that clean bite."
"Wow. Great Notion is going to do amazing things in the future. This beer is wonderfully cloudy and orange juice-esque in appearance. Loads of citrus and tropical juice notes in the taste. Carb level is spot on for a NE IPA. Not too soft, but not overly carbed. Has a slight bitter finish that I really appreciate. Dangerously drinkable at 8.2%."
"The name goes along with the taste of the beer, ""Juice Box"". A very juice flavorful IPA. The low carbonation gives it a smooth taste that makes it hard to put down. The hops explode in your mouth and it has a very unique taste for a IPA. It's very smooth and easy to drink and it packs a good punch. Can't wait to have it available at all times in the beer fridge."
Best IPA I've had in awhile
"This is a great first offering from a new brewery with a bright future. Cloudy with good lacing. The nose is fruity and herbaceous. Not shy on the palette, with lots of tropical fruit. Good balance, with just the right amount of carbonation. Not too sharp, not too soft. Looking forward to more from this new brewery in NE Portland!"
Appearance- Hazy & golden with a slight orange glow from the bottom of the glass. A thick white head dissipates into nice lacing all the way down.
"Had at a tasting at my home, poured into a 5oz taster tulip."
"Perhaps the can I drank wasn’t the freshest, but this was a very good beer yet not a beer worthy of all the hype. It was smooth and tasty, but it didn’t blow me away and have those dank, super hoppy flavors that are normally associated with a beer of this stature. I’d love to try this again a week after the next release to see if it’s different."
"Pours a hazy orange with fine, soft head."
Serving: Can
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.
Canned 8/23
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/20/2018. Pours opaquely hazy/cloudy golden amber/green color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, honey, biscuit dough, light nutty/toast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, honey, biscuit dough, light nutty/toast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, honey, biscuit dough, light nutty/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, fairly sticky, and slightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is an awesome NE DIPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Nice soft feel, not overly aggressive. Great Citra/Galaxy showcase. Very juicy and fairly dank/earthy hop complexity; nice bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. A really enjoyable offering and spot on style example."
Canned 4/20/18 (41 days ago)
Canned 04/20/18
Wow. Wow.
"The beer pours a delicious looking and slightly creamy white head that dissipates at a moderate pace. The beer itself is a cloudy and opaque orange juice yellow that looks really delicious. The smell has an extremely sweet orange with a light grassy note to it. Sometimes there is an alcohol smell that ruins it a little bit but not by much. The taste is a bit more intense with a slightly strong grassy pine note mixed with grapefruit and a fairly strong sweet orange note. The beer has a heavy body but with a thin and smooth feel to it. It has a n interesting slight acidic burn at the end but not much. Overall, a fantastic beer and worth trading for if you can."
really awesome beer great taste and aroma and very smooth
"Cloudy, with a chance of hops... You can smell the hops bursting out of the can of the White Ferrari Double India Pale Ale as soon as you open it, and the smell just grows from there. This is a sturdy beer, gioden, very cloudy, never settles to the point of visibility while drinking it. The hops make their presence known, but not as sharply as you might expect. Like driving a Ferrari (so I've heard) the experience is as smooth as silk. The hops are strong, with a good bit of citrus, and some resin in the back taste, but it pulls a bit of sweetness in to stop the pucker. Coming down to the end of the glass I'm getting more of a hit of the sour notes, but it's enhancing the experience rather than taking away from it. Thank you Veil Brewing of Richmond, Virginia!"
Silky smooth. Loved it.
"look: Darker than I expected, but really nice, cloudy, hazy, turbid look"
Wine glass at brewery. 
"acquired a few veil brews in a trade, trying them for the first time definitely stoked but not sure what to expect! "
Canned 12/11/17; drank 12/15/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Super hazy, NE IPA appearance. Enticing. Lovely aromas of tropical fruit and dank hops. Guava, pineapple, mango. Resinous and juicy. Yes, I know this could describe just about any Tree House or Trillium IPA, but that’s all I have. Time to drink and enjoy."
"Poured a cloudy yellow body with an aroma that is bitter, earthy, lightly acidic and touch of floral hops. Beer is smooth and ""fluffy"" at times yet mostly is sharp and citrusy with a somewhat sour lemon haziness and finishes crisp and biting. There is a juiciness there but this batch didn't live up to the hype as there isn't much maltiness or balance and is mostly an acidic (NE style) IPA."
"One of the best beers I've had! Juicy, fresh IPA. Better than Heady Topper."
She pours a hazy neon golden yellow with a bright glow. 
fresh can (batch 2 in cans maybe?) drank on 8/2/2017
"06.11.2018 - Can version. Just as the tap version from 2017, it's a great NE DIPA with a bright grassy hop profile and great drinkability."
"This beer pours so hazy it looks almost cloudy and pillowy. It sits in the glass so turbid that it looks almost like satin orange juice. It truly looks amazing. The smell is great hazy IPA with a note of sweetness. Tropical fruit and stone fruit with peach predominating. The taste follows the smell but citrus is more prevalent, especially sweet candy orange in the aftertaste. Starts dry but becomes slightly sweet in the middle and in the after taste. Not really all that bitter on the back end which I personally love. The feel of this beer follows the look as a matter of fact; pillowy smooth. Overall this is a world class Hazy IPA. Truly delicious and up there with anything from Treehouse."
Many thanks to Knapp85 for this can!
Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass.
"16 oz. can from Veil Anniversary Party on April 22, 2017. Poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass."
"Great hazy DIPA , this one tastes a little lighter than most Veil DIPAs . Tropical fruit with a little pepper "
"Dark opaque yellow orange color with a thin white head around the rim. Foamy white lacing around the glass. Piney, hoppy aroma with light citrus notes. Tastes of green melon, light citrus, and juicy hops. No a lot of bitterness for a DIPA. Body is very light, very easy to drink for an 8% abv."
"Appearance: a little hazy, but not so thick that you can't see the other side of the tunnel "
poured from a 16 oz can (canned 12/13/2016) into a Veil house glass. 
"Did we need another reminder that Veil isn't fucking around? Well, we got one and I sure ain't complaining. Poured two and a half weeks after canning. Nose is citrus, freshly ground weed, some cat piss and potpourri. Tastes like pineapple, tangelo, papaya, stonefruit and lemon zest rounding it out. Feels fat but finishes dry with slight heat. This is straight dank, juice-drenched hop resins. Whiteferrari can easily sit with their best DIPAs i.e. CCTT/Broznies/Dirt Nap and can rival most of the big boys in New England."
12/13/16 Can
Great all around beer. Well done
"Batch#1. This DIPA is amazing on all levels! Fruit, malt, bitterness all balanced to perfection! Seek this DIPA whenever it comes out again, as I will for sure! Cheers."
"Sixteen ounce can poured into a tulip glass. December 13 canned on date. This was four days old. Hazy look, smell is unbelievable. Taste is out of this world."
Look : Unique. Opaque and foggy but also bright. Almost like there is a white pigment mixed in. Doesn't settle much either.
"Really hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma is really dank and vegetal with spinach, cabbage and chives. Taste follows, really vegetal, oniony, herbal, medium bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, really smooth on the palate. A really dank IPA, smooth and extremely hoppy."
"Overall definitely a good IPA, but not the best I've ever had from OH. The Mosaic hops are showcased nicely, but overall I think I prefer them as a blended hop from Other Half than on their own."
"Very good IPA indeed. Tons of floral, cirtusy, and dank aromas and flavors. Mosaic is a great hop to be showcased on it's own. Must say I dig Amarillo and Mylar bags a little more than this one though. I also enjoy Yellow Rose a touch more as far as single hope mosaic IPA's go but if offered, I'd happily drink this all the time."
"Yes, Mosaic makes the world a better place. OH does it OH style and reminds NYC that the bar is set high."
This is probably one of the finest single IPAs I have ever had. Gloriously juice and delicious! Need to find more of this stat! Tons of hops here but still drinkable.
"L - semi-opaque nectar out of the can. Deep bready orange hue with yellow fringes. Head settles quickly, but leaves crater-like bubbles of all sorts of sizes. Some craters are made up of a bunch of tiny bubbles! Okay, enough with the look, the smell is getting overwhelming!"
"Picked this up when it was released a few weeks ago and finally got around to it tonight as I'm going through all of my Other Half beers in order by age. Even though Other Half's collaborations tend to be their standout beers, this was pretty impressive and possibly the best of their single-hop offerings. Everything that makes an IPA and a beer from Other Half enjoyable was present here and this was very tough not to crush down, as I needed time to warm this up and review it!"
White head with lace. Golden sunset orange color. 
Pours a beautiful orange-peach color with an effervescent white head. 
"Wow! What an awesome single-hop beer from OH. Normally single hop beers can be a bit one dimensional in flavor but mosaic provides a depth of flavor and aroma that makes it, in my opinion, the ultimate hop if you're doing a single varietal. "
"L: Slightly darker peach, pumpkin, and honeycomb hues with an evident haziness and rich white foam head"
"On tap at Other Half Brewing in Brooklyn, NY."
"An exceptional beer from a great brewery! I had this on tap at the brewery. Great color, nice aroma, and a great taste! Well worth the trip out to the brewery!"
Poured from a can into a teku glass. Canned 8/15.
Love Mosaic hops so had to give this a go
"This is an amazing IPA - citrus smell and taste just blast you when you pour and sip. This is an absolutely awesome beer, and another representation of what other half is doing - creating amazing single-hop killers."
"Yellow Rose is my favorite beer. And that's without question. So when I found out one of my favorite breweries would be brewing a Mosaic IPA, I flew in (coincidentally), stood in line, and got a case of the stuff. I was not disappointed."
"Not a big fan of mosaic hops, but I'll give it a try. 16 oz. can into a snifter (at the office)!"
"Poured from the can into a tulip glass, the beer has a pale orange filtered body, with a white head that isn't really there, maybe due to a not very aggressive pour. Solid lacing. "
"Pours a golden orange. Subtle pine and citrus nose. Crisp, clean, earthy green grassy pine resin with grapegruit and perfect malt backbone. Love this beer!"
"This is the perfect IPA for me. Huge piney aroma, mango/melon flavors, and a perfect balance of hop and malt. The hop is showcased extremely well here. The malty notes that are left on your tongue, you can just chew on all day. One of the best smelling beers I've ever come across and certainly one of the best fresh IPA's I've ever hard. So thankful my friend made the trip to Brooklyn and shared some with me."
"This is a super nice beer. Resonably strong bitter flavor and the very low malt dont go together that well for me, but the floral notes more than make up for it. Would seek out again"
"16 oz. can poured into a snifter. Hazy orange body. Huge garlic mosaic aroma. Wow. Strong garlic. Taste is almost as garlicky, but it has a bit of tropical fruit. Some pale malt sweetness and moderate bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. This is really good, but super heavy on the garlic mosaic aroma."
"Had this at The Festival of Dankness. Smell was super funky. Kind of a burnt rubber/stink bomb thing going on I wasnt a fan of. I feel like something was up with the line or something, though, because the taste was awesome. Just a really strange smell. May have to revisit this one."
"Aromas explode from the can upon opening, could smell it across the room even before pouring. Really sweet dank resiny, almost sweaty aromas. Some tropical fruits and cut grass on palate with a clean crisp finish. Just a world class IPA."
"Wonderfully well balanced ipa. Pours with a nice airy head. Very floral and tropical on the nose. Tastes of citrus, mango and maybe a little pineapple. Delicious to say the least. Very impressive"
"Another class beer in the other half line up. Which, speaking of lineup, I had to lineup for a case of these. Well worth the wait. Pours a hazy light amber color with a bit of head. Plenty of hops. Can definitely smell the pine notes. Has a lot of character. I understand why people travel to get this one."
8/15/15 canning date. 16oz. can into a Carton Boat Beer glass. 
"The aroma out of the can is unreal, poured into a Teku, the smell filled the room in a good way. Canned 8/15, drank 8/15, my favorite of the 5 different Other Half cans I've had, a joy to drink"
L - Dark orange with tons of ugly sediment. Barely any head.
Appearance: Gold with light orange
"Smells great, but for me the taste sort of falls kind of flat."
Thanks to mrbubbler for sharing this one at his tasting.
"Oh good God. Honey colored heaven under a thick white head lay an aroma of grapefruit and just a hint of earthy must. Taste is overwhelming just recently ripened grapefruit that overtakes everything until the slightest appearance of green onion ripples politely through, allowing for a clean crisp finish with just a smidge of sweetness but never a bit cloying. This is probably the best IPA I've had yet."
"16oz can into OH snifter. This beer is fantastic, it's 98% as good as HF Mosaic which is one of my top 5 beers. Smell is exactly what I'm looking for in a single hop IPA and the tropical taste that follows keeps you coming back for more."
On tap at Other Half.
"On tap at Other Half on 5/21/15. A fantastic showcase for the Mosaic hop, which just jumps right at you from go. Has an amazing aroma that mirrors the taste. Just wonderful."
"This beer is outstanding. This is a top three beer for Other Half. Only made once so far, this one needs to find its way back into the rotation. Love the smell of this one."
"Not much to say here other than I'm giving this a perfect score. It's my fave out of all their releases thus far. A tropical hop bomb with one of the best noses I've experienced when fresh. The taste follows the nose. Tons of lush papaya, mango, pineapple etc. Get yourself some. OH is here to stay and can play with the New England big boys."
"The beer comes in a golden yellow, with touches of orange, slightly hazy."
"Other Half makes a lot of IPAs, some tastier than others. To me, this guy is the king. I've had it in cans and on tap (these are observations from a recent growler pour), and it is always beautiful. Glassy orange-gold with a voluminous head. Nose full of sharp pinecone and tangerine. It's as pure a showcase of this hop - one of my favorites - as you can find. Tingles the nostrils without an off note. The taste follows with a mosaic explosion of resin and citrus, followed by some malty quiet biscuit-bread notes. If it's in any way underwhelming, that's only because this beer smells like perfection. Medium light on the tongue. Totally refreshing. Mosaic is the absolute real deal."
This is probably the best ipa other half has done. This single hop series is a great plain malt base to really let the hops shine. All of the tropical mosaic characteristics are front and center. My only complaint is the mouthfeel on these beers can be a little watery. I think some flaked oats and could help bring this up to a top tier ipa. I also feel their ipas are much better with a couple weeks on them.
serving: growler
"I was hesitant to buy as many cans as I did of this, only to regret not buying more. The body is a little thin, but still a great vehicle for this aromatic dank bomb. My favorite other half beer so far. Keep em comin' Other half... Or at least make this a year round staple."
"Picked up cans a few hours ago, enjoyed from an OH snifter. "
"The line was worth it! Drinking a can while watching Twin Peaks if anybody cares.. The one armed man is freaking out! The beer is a bit out of the norm in appearance. It's quite yellow and hazy. It looks like a hefeweizen or gose. I can't get enough of the aroma! My GF can smell it across the room! White peach, bubblegum, and melon are in the forefront here, with a touch of cereal grain to really round it out. The taste follows suit and leaves an incredible balance of sweet and bitter lasting on my tongue. Medium bodied which I think suits the flavor profile just right. Thank You again Other Half!"
Awesome
My second Treehouse beer. It's really good. Lots of fruit in the mango variety with a light bitterness and a clean finish.
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer is from July 2018 and has been in my fridge since purchase. Beer pours a murky goldenrod color with almost no light passing through the glass.
Consumed 10/1/18
Prefer this over Alter Ego. More complex add interesting.
Similar to Alter Ego of course. Very good. Love the citrus aroma and taste. Hard to get if not in MA.
"Pours a cloudy orange brown with a one inch white head that was poorly retained but left a lot of lacing. Smells of amazing tropical fruits with a bit of citrus. Tastes of mango, peach, apricot, tangerine, a bit of orange pith and wheat. Medium bodied, light carbonation, creamy mouth feel and minimal bitterness."
"Pours hazy, orange brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is apricots, tangerine, and wet hops. Medium bodied, low carbonation, and slightly bitter. Still get the dankness of Alter Ego but way more smooth. Prefer this way more than the original, which is my least favorite of Tree House's regulars. Heavier body and a bit more flavor. Will get this again."
"A decent option, but not one for which I would wait in line again."
Smells good feels good tastes like barf.
"Rating side by side w alter ego. Pours urtually the same. Maybe slightly darker but nice hazy dark orange with minimal had retention. Nose is little stronger with some over ripe peaches and stone fruit. Little More earth and grassy notes floating around in there. Taste has wicked up front pounding of mango, orange, tangerine. Smooth and beautiful mouthful. More coating than regular alter. Litte less carb it seems. The flavor intensifies into juicy bliss of fruit basket flavors. Pineapple, peach, orange,apricot. Mmmmmm Finishes with clean dry minimal lingering bitterness. The mid to end palate is amazing. Alter ego seems to have less front end to me with just as nice mid to late palate flavor. Aaalter had more flavor but to say it's an upgrade is questionable. Both have something to offer and each has its own character. Love both. Go treehouse!"
"This one pours a very hazy orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Thanks to rudzud for picking this up, canned 7/11"
Purchased at the brewery a few weeks ago. Superb color and carbonation that faded but left a little lacing. The smell hit you as soon as you popped the top. Major citris and grapefruit. My first impresssion was a dry complex flavor medium bodied.
Picked up some cans of these at the brewery.
Canned 6/14/18; drank 6/26/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"Pours a pale hazy golden yellow. It's one of Tree House's better looking beers. Aromatic, more aromatic than Alter Ego which I had blind side by side with this. Sugar cane and mango mostly, some dankness to it as well. A lot of that sugar cane carries through and there is some underlying tree bark and grapefruit which becomes more apparent on the finish. It's well rounded like most TH IPAs are and while I may like it better today than Alter Ego, I'd take the regular version 9 times out of 10. I appreciate Alter's balance."
"A solid beer. Haven’t had an Alter Ego in some time, but I think I can say I’m reminded more of Doppleganger but with less alcohol. Typical of this family of beers, mango and dank orange dominate the flavor."
Saw some people on the forums saying this wasn’t very good. I have zero issues with it. Basically it is just another hoppy juice bomb from Tree House that makes me happy to be such a short drive from there!
"L - just need HHHazeee and the gang's all here. I'm a bit weird that they're just pumping out these special variants left and right especially after talking about how they waited on GGGreennn to make sure it was perfect, but here goes. Looks like Alter Ego! Dark brownish orange with that classic extra dry-hopped milky haze. Not much head on this one. "
Poured from a 16 oz can into a teku glass.
A 1 pint can with no canned on or best before date. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.
"L - very hazy peach colour, nice white head"
"Pours a hazy orange with thick, creamy foam that leaves quite a lot of lacing."
"On tap. Herbal hop notes, dank, cheesy. Sweetish, hoppy, sweaty, dank hops, herbal bitterness on the finish. Medium body and carbonation. Citrusy hops, a bit astringent, dry, easy drinking."
It's better than the beer in your hand right now...
"L - Golden orange, murky body, finger of white head"
I really enjoyed this addition too the one series. They never disappoint. Big fan of sand city. They just keep upping their game. Look forward to more from them.
"Medium gold body is opaque as fruit juice. Into a nonic pint kicked up three fingers of off-white foam, and left lots of messy lace behind..."
"From yesterday's can release, it pours cloudy orange gold color with a solid 1 finger foamy white head that dissipated very slowly and leaves excellent foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down. Classic New England IPA looks and on par for the Sand City ONE series. They are spoiling us with great looking ONE brews."
"Immediately reminds me of this year's batch of Headroom from Trillium. Very Mosaic-forward in both a fruity (mango, papaya, grapefruit) and dank (weed, herbal) way with that classic fresh ONE series grassy/bitter Galaxy contribution. It's not as sweet as Headroom (and not as malt-forward as the OG Infinity+1, IIRC), but there is minimal astringency on the finish and no 'burn' from excessive hopping, as I picked up in fresh Headroom. I think this beer will be insanely good in 2-3 weeks when the grassy/bitter/veg notes turn fruity and the sweet, rich, caramel-y malt that is hiding deep underneath the hops emerges a bit more."
"This is an exact replica of Haze from Treehouse. Incredible scent as you pop the can, dank for days, like taking a hit (you know what I mean). The first couple of sips are super sweet and bitter at the same time, very complex and aromatic. The mouthfeel tapers off and you just crave the next sip after another. Highly recommended, I'll be keeping all of these to myself."
Like drinking a pine forest.
"Sap wasn't a good beer. I had this beer the first time it was released and it somehow was worse. It was improved greatly with sssappp. However, super sap is pretty bad."
"Pours an orange hue with a two finger had with lingering lace. Smells of citrus and pine, true to original Sap. Taste is sweet, crisp, a little soapy. Bitter and refreshing. Decently frothy mouthfeel."
"Hazy medium-golden orange, like juice, with a finger or two of ivory head and low lace sheeting following the beer down the glass... Pine and pith on the nose, followed by more of the same on the sip... A dry backbone of grapefruit pith is aired out by pine and woody notes, and rounded off by subtle suggestions of mild tropical fruits... Bitterness is fairly moderate and the sugars are held in firm check as well... Smooth and soft, medium-light body, with a nice herbal pine air lingering behind... Very gracefully done... 6/7/18 canning..."
"L: Poured a nice 1 finger head with perfect retention. Crisp golden color, perfectly opaque. Some lace"
Appearance: Pours cloudy and the color of orange juice with a two finger head; plenty of lacing is left behind
Indulged this brew under a frozen Arethusa falls
"Poured like OJ, with a nice settling white head and medium lace."
Very piney and a slightly bitter bite.
A- Tallboy can into a tasting chalice with a cloudy golden orange hue. The crown is about an inch tall with a thick and creamy consistency and very good retention. Thick blankets of lace form immediately and trail down the glass.
"Somehow this one eluded me all these year. Canned 12/20/17, thanks to rudzud. "
Acquired from a trade for OH Hypersleep. Canned 12/8/17 (SSSAPPYYY HOLIDAYS! :]). Enjoyed on 1/9/18 in my Tree House wine glass.
"This one pours a bright and hazy golden orange, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing. It's honestly as beautiful looking as this style gets."
"pours out a beautiful hazed pale yellow color with a dense bright white head that leaves some nice lacing. nose is pulpy grapefruit juice, pithy grapefruit peel, dankness, lemon, bready malts, pine needles, and a grassy herbal quality. on palate is much the same - a sharp grapefruit note, lemon, orange peel, the grainy thing, hint of bubblegum and mango, hit of bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit and pine resin on the finish. mouthfeel is pure fluff. very soft and tasty overall, nothing insane in terms of flavor profile but really well balanced and delicate."
A 16 oz. can date 12-20-2017 poured into a Tree House snifter.
2 week old can into chalice.
"On tap at the brewery served in plastic (ewww). Extra hazy orange color, great lacing. Piney aroma. Lots of bubblegum and pine in the flavor, serious bubblegum. Astringent at the end. Pretty good but I wouldn’t wait in line for this."
16oz can canned 6 days ago on 12/20/17. 
"But, to be fair, I have a cold."
L: Peach juice.
"Piney, resiny deliciousness. Great mouthfeel, boquet of aromas. Another great offering from TH."
"Updated review , 6/9 had sap then super sap. Wow super sap the malt and creamy mouthfeel increased , compared to sap the gapefruit is in the background and more pine and better over all balanced. This tastes like the sap I remember and love"
Picked up at the brewery two days ago. Every other release this sold out to the person in front of me; third time was the charm.
"Look: typical treehouse, beautiful opaque orange/gold with a half finger white head. "
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA"
Canned 6 days ago. 
"Can poured into snifter; seems to have more carbonation than SAP. Hazy orange color, with citrus notes and hops to nose. The carbonation tickles the palate and the beer is well balanced. This is easy to drink!"
"Look: yellow orange hazy in color, light carbonation and a thin white head."
Can poured into Spiegelau.
"Opaque grapefruit juice with a large, white foamy head leaving tons of wedding garter lace."
Was better with about 10-14 days of age to it. Slightly better than Sap but still many other TH I would rather drink
"Having only been able to try Julius and Eureka w/ Citra, I was beyond psyched to trade for a can of this. Was worried I waited too long to open it after the 12/16 canning date but this has held up impeccably. Melonball, pineapple and mango are dominant on the tongue and the nose. Slight dank note but no heat or bitterness. Maybe some kumquat lingering on the tastebuds. Whatever hop combo they used here is impeccable. Balances the vegetal and tropical flavors remarkably well. This is the first DIPA my Leffe-loving father has enjoyed. I'll be in line if and when this releases again."
"huge frothy 2"" head retains well, a dense burnt yellow fills out the bottom of the glass, not super bright but not dark. Aromas of dank green tree huggers and sugar and salt covered melon. Taste, is wow. A juice bomb with a tiny pine cone backbone, very green yet fruity. The feel is incredible, much softer and pillowy than doubleganger (did a side by side). This is a beer that could get me into some serious trouble, the almost 8% abv is almost completely muted and the hops shine, this is a beauty."
"Pour is a super hazy light orange hue, typical of most TH beers but a little more lighter. Frothy head with great lacing. Great tropical notes, plenty of mango, papaya, kiwi and melon. A little cracker-like malt in there. Taste is pine forward with the same tropical notes I got in the aroma but slightly less noticeable. Same cracker-like malt in the back end compliments the resinous hop profile. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily, and medium bodied with low carbonation. Dry finish. Anothe fantastic TH offering, not overly juicy like most. Great traditional IPA hop/pine profile with the NE style twist."
"Do the guys at Tree House ever swing and miss? Unfiltered orange color - no surprise. The nose is a little more subtle than other TH offerings and surprised me with a bit of the tropical aroma normally associated with the juice bombs. Taste starts off like regular Sap - piney and earthy, but then a secondary flavor comes through - some hints of Julius-like tropicals. Finishes with a bit of citrus and slight hops bitter kick. Super soft mouth feel as usual. The piney flavor is a nice change of pace. This is exactly what Sap needed to kick it from the tasty, but largely ordinary to another Tree House classic."
"Exceptional beer, and a bit different from some of the others I've had from Tree House."
Canned 12/16/16. Consumed 12/25/16.
Picked up a single van today in the parking lot in a trade. Was upset when I couldn't get upon release 2 weeks ago so I was all over the opening!
Served in a tulip glass from a can packaged on 12/16/2016.
"This beer pours a murky dark yellow color with a creamy, one finger, bright white head. Retention is moderate and there is a ton of thin spotted webs of lacing left all over the glass."
"Pours light orangy-yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is lime, orange, grapefruit, and light pine at the finish. Dank, slightly bitter, medium heavy-bodied with moderate carbonation. Typical clean, sweet, and pulpy Tree House finish. A bit drier than other Tree House imperial beers. A vast improvement on regular Sap. While I think Sap is good, of all the Tree House beers it is not amongst my favorites. This however, is an all day type of beer...Really nice mix of fruit and pine. Well worth seeking out."
L - awesome label. Same holographic sheen as Doubleganger. Bit of a ridiculous name though...
"Golden, almost straw towards the top. Smell is really bright! Grapefruit and resin, a little boozy. Taste is... delicious. Resin, some grapefruit bitterness, stonefruit on the back, leaves a dank flavor in your mouth that is earthy and full of pine needles. Pillowy mouthfeel, smooth, moderate carbonation, feels like a lot of really tiny bubbles that all burst very quickly and leave it really soft and mellow, and so easy to drink. Makes me salivate. I could drink a hundred of them."
What a wonder cold day to grab a wonderful new release. The beer pours a darker shade of orange! This beer is so crushable! It's a little more piney and juicy then c28! quite delightful
"I'm not sure about zero IBUs, but the bitterness level is extremely low. Lots of tropical fruit flavors along with citrus and a hint of pine and earthy dankness. The lack of bitterness is a detractor to me with the overall flavor profile being a bit too sweet. 9.3% abv is nearly undetectable - impressive."
"4/5: Classic Veil IPA: tropical, citrusy, dank, and devoid of bitterness; almost too dry though"
Poured from a 16 oz can (canned 2/21/2017) into a Veil Brewing Ski TEKU
"Look: thick 1.5 inch head, yellow orange color, no light passing through"
"Medium dark hazy orange color.  White lacing around the edge of the glass.  Piney aroma with citrus hints.  Booze slightly apparent in the nose.  Fresh juice bomb, high ABV not apparent at all.  0 ibu allows for the bite of the beer to come from the carbonation.  Smooth and fresh tasting beer that can sneak up on you with the 9% abv. Quite likely the best IPA I have tasted."
Pint can poured into their house glass
"Cloudy gold color and a phenomenal funky floral nose. Honey suckle flavor over a consistent bitter backbone. Plenty of mouthfeel with light carbonation. You would never know it's 9.3%, be careful."
12 oz pour on draft at the Veil.
"Aw hell, one of the best iipa ive ever had. Golden pour, fairly large head. Incredibly juicy aroma, peach, extremely dank, mango. Tropical and stone fruit taste, mango, peach, overripe citrus, resin, weed, grains. Medium to slightly heavier body."
Poured into a Wicked Weed snifter. Bottom of can says 08/30/16.
Man. Pours a cloudy orange color with a nice 1 oz head. Smells of tropical fruit and hops. Taste is of a juicy pineapple and mango and papaya. Great balance with the hops. What a great beer this is. Cheers to Veil.
"This is just amazing. So much juicey, tropical, citrus hoppy goodness. Not bitter at all, nice burnt orange color. Great full mouth feel, sweet but not overly sweet. If I could drink this every day I would."
Appearance: pours a deep earthy orangish hue. a two finger off white head forms and has a stubborn retention. hazy and cloudy making it completely opaque
Hop juice.
"Pours hazy orange with thin, white head. Aroma of orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, bubble gum, maybe some berry, and tropical fruits Insane. Flavor follows aroma with very light malt and basically no bitterness whatsoever. Big orange juice flavor with mango, pineapple, and that touch of dank herb, pine and onion.. Hop oils just stick to the tongue. It has just enough crackery malt backbone and sweetness to balance the high ABV. Like others from The Veil, It is amazing that this beer hits 9+% ABV because it is really not detectable in the flavor of the beer at all. It is warming in the gut after a minute, but amazingly smooth. The feel is smooth also, slightly creamy medium+ with med-low carbonation. Absolutely decadent. This really is straight hop juice. Ridiculously good beer."
"L - pours a sandy haze. Thick, flat, one hue. Yellow brown. Not much in the way of gradients. Sticky head that leaves nice lacing. "
"L - Light orange color, hazy body, finger of white head"
"Can from today's release, it pours cloudy gold color with a solid 2 finger foamy white head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating very slowly while leaving really nice foamy lacing with rings as it went down. As with all Sand City beers, this has the classic NE style IPA good looks, which I've come to expect from these guys."
"Can release today. 1/14/18Pours super merky. Big two finger white head. Nice lacing. Aroma of pineapple and tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose with tangerine, passion fruit, earthy tones, very faint booze,citrus and light orange juice finish. Great DIPA. Big fan of sand city. This one hits every note."
So much buzz about this one heading into the release I had to crack it first. Huge thanks to Dan for braving the cold and snagging me some cans.
L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a yellow-orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy head that lasted an average amount of time. Very good lacing.
"L - I do love this name! Pours a dull yellowy orange. Head dissipates quickly but leaves behind some nice lacing. Got some pretty serious legs here. Should be a fun one. Gotta say though, OG Fluctuation looked better!"
"7 days old when reviewed. Poured from 16 oz. can into District 96 tulip glass. It pours an opaque, almost murky, brownish-orange color with a thin cap of creamy, milk-white head and extensive, clinging lacing. It's a very attractive pour. On the nose there is lemon, lime, peach, some sweet tropical fruit, onion, mint leaves, pine, and a whiff of vanilla/lactose. There's not much hop presence in the smell. The taste is amazing! It's so nuanced. The first taste I notice is sweet tropical fruit and vanilla, much like Equillibrium's Fluctuation. Then, there is tart lemon and lime, followed by a dose of Citra and Galaxy hops that are delicate but very flavorful, without a strong bite. All of the flavors blend beautifully to create an overall delicious DIPA. This ale is creamy, full-bodied, with a near perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV is just enough to give it a real pop without being distracting. It's risky to try to merge two DIPAs as good as Fluctuation and Sexual Frustration, but Equilibrium and District 96 succeed beyond reasonable expectation. Sexual Fluctuation is a tour de force! I'm glad it is brewed periodically and I will always seek it out."
Crowler purchased at the source at last Saturday's release.
This is damn good. Would I chase it? Yes. Would I remember why I'm chasing? No.
"Pours a very cloudy yellow golden color with a thin foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Big juicy aroma. Citrus and piney. Big juicy taste as well. Citrus and piney, smooth on the end. Aftertaste is citrusy with some caramel at the end. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very good beer."
"Another winner from Equilibrium. Pours a nice golden/orange color. Nice aroma though not overwhelming. Very nice citrus/hop hit up front and wonderful flavor on the back end. Excellent beer, tasty and yet smooth and easy to drink. Cheers"
Canned 1/17/18; drank 1/29/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"Please pardon the overabundance of words in this review, I'm a bit excited as this is one of the best NEIPA I've ever tasted."
"L - thick, cloudy, yeasty haze. Looks like the bottom of the keg, but that's what all TB DIPAs look like so I'm not (too) worried. Fine mist of a head with some nice sticky lacing. "
16 oz can from the brewery - drank about a week later. 
Can poured into a teku
On-tap at the brewery
FIRST DRAFT I EVER HAD FROM THE BARN. ❤ AT 1ST SIGHT !!!
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of spearmint, grapefruit, grass, and a little earthy. It tastes of spearmint, grapefruit, candy, grass, and a little earthy. The beer is medium light. This is a pretty good IPA from Tilted barn."
"4.5s across the board for an amazing DIPA, juicy but not too sweet, dry finish but not overly bitter, soft mouth feel but not unnatural. This is better than most NE DIPAs."
I prefer this over the Chosen One which I found to be a little too sweet.
"16 oz can undated purchased at the brewery. Hazy orange color and hoppy/citrusy nose. Flavors are mostly citrus rind such as grapefruit, orange and lemon with a hint of mango. Creamy and smooth without being overly bitter from the hops and no heat from the alcohol. Our favorite Tilted Barn beer."
I like this one better than The Chosen One
16 oz can was poured into a pint glass.
"Simply put, this is the very best DIPA I've had the pleasure of trying. It's just.....perfect. Beautiful, hazy, lacy, in the glass, smell is a tropical citrus bounty. Tastes like heaven. Feel is tingly and perfectly smooth. Just so well done. Bravo Tilted barn."
Can from Jon - awesome beer!
16oz can dated 7/27/17.
L - Gorgeous hazy orange with two fingers of fluffy white head
Look: orange with a creamy one inch head
Poured from a 16 oz can with no discernable date into a tulip glass.
"So I thought Chosen One was basically a perfect beer (perhaps a tad yeasty but that's nitpicking)....and then I had a can of this. Damn, where to begin....perfect hazy tangerine hue with a bright citrus aroma. Taste is mango and citrus with that bubblegum, pillowy mouthfeel. Smooth finish, no lingering yeast. A perfect NEIPA."
"This one pours a golden orange with the same glowing neon haze as Peeptoad. Also like Peeptoad, The Other One has a tiny head that leaves a ton of retentive lacing. These guys make gorgeous beers. "
"pours out a hazed light gold color with a dense bright white head. pungent aromas of mango, creamy orange, peach, pithy citrus peel, grapefruit, bubblegum, spicy yeasty note, hint of some green dankess and very mellow pine. on palate is soft and creamy orangesicle, sweet honey-mango note, hint of bubblegum, doughy malts, some green and grapefruity notes, floral spice, peppery with a hint of pine on the finish. soft mouthfeel with some fluffy texture to it. overall really really nice stuff, cant wait to try more from these guys!"
"Poured 12/3/16 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery the previous day, into an imperial pint glass."
"A: Fresh tangy citrus zest, coupled with sweet tropical fruit aromas."
"Poured this from a growler filled on April 18, 2018. 750mL fill."
Appearance: Arrives a cloudy goldenstraw color with a modest head; streaky lacing action
"Huge mango, tropical fruits, very hoppy"
I'm
Yeah. Really nothing to say other than this was extraordinary.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Juicy with mellow fruit notes, citrusy but also vegetal notes like chives. Light bitterness overall."
04/29/2017 @ Anchorage Brewing Co fundraiser/tasting.
Canned 4/7/17; drank 4/16/17 @ the Yarchives. 
This is my favorite of all of the Monkish IPAs. Great balance of all hazy yeasty goodness. So glad they seem to be willing to keep making it! near perfect
"16oz can poured into speiglau - 10/31/16 ""TRICK OR TREAT"""
pours a pale peach almost white---cloudy color---love it (steer clear of clear beer!)
"Pours nice white head. Super cloudy great lacing. Aroma is pineapple, lemons, malt and tropical fruits. Taste has grassy tones, pineapple, lemon light hop bitterness. Very well made. Look forward to more from them."
"Split a can dated 10/31/16 with ""Trick or Treat"" on the bottom. Pours completely cloudy yellow color, looking like pineapple juice, leaving minimal spotty lacing. Great looking East Coast IPA."
Very disappointing given the hype. Falls far short of Trillium and Tree House.
From a can dated 10/31/16
"The aroma on this one is amazing. Is that pina colada (heavy on the pineapple) in beer form? Wow. The appearance is unique, like that bottled pineapple coconut (pina colada) juice in the grocery store. Taste doesn't quite deliver for me. Still incredible!"
"My first brew from these guys and it was fantastic, that hazy big hop juicy ipa that we are chasing, chase no more its in CA"
Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.
"Thanks to Chris for the can. Hazy yellow body with a soapy white head. Lemons and tart citrus. Hop forward flavor, mild bitterness. Juicy and tangy. Quite tasty."
Poured into an Ommegang stemmed glass. No freshness date.
"Pours a cloudy light yellow with a white head, good retention and lacing. Aromas and flavors of tropical and citrus fruit, guava, some orange juice, and a lemongrass and hay-like Belgian yeast character. Drying quality with a very good mouthfeel. Well done!"
"A: Pale cloudy yellow, 2 finger white head, good retention, light lacing"
"Appearance: turbid, cloudy, hazy, unfiltered as hell. Looks like pineapple juice / light version of orange juice. thick nectar."
"Trillium does such a great job with their DDH offerings, and this one is excellent. I got a big glob of fresh, juicy hop resin out of my first can, and it was quite a treat. This one is bursting with flavor and ""fizzyness"", for lack of a better term."
"Outstanding DIPA. Haze for days, and tropical fruits crushing the nose... gets a little ripe at the finish, but drinks so nice. Trillium consistently on point"
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a one pint can on May 14, 2018. An intensified version of Scaled. The secondary dry hop of El Dorado and Citra results in an enhanced nose of citrus, pineapple, and wet earth. The flavor brings intense lime, refreshingly pithy bitterness and just a touch of toasted malt. Medium bodied with a dry finish."
A - Pours a turbid orange with a very thin fizzy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.
16 oz. can dated 4/3/18. Poured into Carton dubvariant glass.
"Pours bright orange juice color - orange, opaque, and lively. Thin off-white head dissipates quickly leaving spotty lacing and some sudsy foam on top of the beer. "
L: lightly dense for a ne IPA with smallish uneven head
16oz can dated 12/15/17.
"This was my first truly ""juicy"" IPA and it lived up to the category. Very citrusy with grapefruit being the most prominent. Very pleasant brew but lacking the usual strong bitter hop impact typical of American IPAs. Very easy drinking and well balanced."
"great looking brew, head is a little less creamy than i am used to these days, not that it makes any difference! this is super aromatic, pouring it out unleashes a bouquet of hops - pulpy OJ and grapefruit predominating, some dankness as well. palate is much the same, danky green qualities, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon, slightly floral and grassy, smack of bitterness on the finish. mouthfeel is on point. overall this one definitely packs a lot of flavor, only critique would maybe be the hop saturation/burn"
Very very nice.
16oz can purchased at the Canton brewery dated 10/24/17. Hazy orange look and citrus nose. Citrus flavors such as mango and pineapple come through with a grapefruit background especially on the finish. Another easy-drinking and tasty Trillium brew.
Hazy yellow color with a thick head with short retention 
Look: Hazy yellow with 3 inch white head. Medium low carbonation.
"Pours like a cloudy orange juice with a half inch, poorly retained head that left almost no lacing. Smells of citrus, tropical fruits and pine. Tastes of pineapple, grapefruit, lime, pine and a hint of malts. Moderate bitterness and a dry finish. Medium bodied and carbonation."
"Had this at the Canton brewery. The beer had a pale yellow appearance with no head. Aromas seemed to be a grapefruit mixture which followed with a nice, citrus balance with its taste; very approachable. Medium body. Overall, this was not bad, but not the best one from Trillium I had that night."
bottle share - 8/19/17
"Pours a cloudy orange yellow like juice. Huge fruity aroma. Lots of tangerine, pineapple, and passion fruit. Moderate bitterness. Tropical and citrus fruit taste with a hint of resin. Very well done IPA."
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus. Taste is also a very pleasant citrus and possibly pineapple.
"16 oz can, a few weeks old"
"Pours a hazy shade of orange juice with a nice foamy head and very sticky lacing. Picking up a lot of citrus, floral notes, hops, and some piney goodness. Tastes wonderful, loads of juicy citrus with a nice even bite mixed in. Feeling some mild pine on the back end. This is a real treat, very full flavored IPA that keeps you coming back for more sips. Medium feel to this one, very enjoyable any time, top notch for sure."
"16oz. can served in my Dialed in tulip. Canned on 7/5/17. Pours a milky orange with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head that sizzles and pops and dissipates towards the edges. Nose expresses citrus, passionfruit, pith and herbal notes. Taste consistent with nose - more pith and herbal forward with the addition of guava. Mouthfeel is light in body with a midl acidity and an even carbonation shy of lively. Overall, a typical Trillium IPA - bright, citrusy and drinkable."
From a 16oz can
16oz Can
16 oz can poured into spegaleu IPA glass canned on 5/16
1 pint in a can with a canned on date of 5.16.17. Fresh stuff
Hazy light orange color. There was a small white head that left a bit of lace.
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 day-old can. Looks like a typical Trillium brew: turbid golden-orange with a medium sized white head. Aromas are fantastic: pineapple, grapefruit, and dank earthy notes. The taste follows with pineapple leading the way. Somewhat grassy and herbal. A soft feel (no surprise) with a dry, clean finish."
"First had 5/26/17 at home. Was brought two cans of this from a recent friend's trip up north. Super hazy, orange/yellow appearance. Fantastic citrusy bitter flavor with a very dry finish, some biscuit, some earth, but all awesome."
"Canned 5/17/17. Pours yellow with big fluffy two finger head. Aroma tropical fruits and citrus. Taste pineapple, roasted malt, citrus, lime juice with light earthy tone finish. Another great DDH from trillium. Big fan of them."
"This one is delicious, but Trillium has the bar set so high. El Dorado makes it a drier beer than most of their offerings. It is still citrusy in the front and packs a bunch of flavor."
"Went back to look at my rating for Julius, as I drank this right after another can of the ""J"" and this was pretty much the same thing. Pours a hazy yellow with a w creamy white head. Smells super citrus, like sticking your head in the tropical fruit isle. Taste bring forth a citrus explosion akin to drinking orange juice that someone squeezed from the rind. I say that because there is no sweetness, and also an accompanying bitterness on the palate after the beer goes down. Awesome stuff."
"Looks a perfect example of the hazy New England style. Very creamy, the orange pops. "
"Pours a bright and hazy orange. Huge nose of tropical fruit and earth. The taste follows with big notes of orange pith, grapefruit, pineapple, and a dank earthiness. Feel is soft and smooth. Overall, another outstanding beer from Trillium!"
"Medium-to-pale gold body, hazed as expected, finger of white head left some bits of lace behind. Citric aroma was sharp, rounded slightly with floral and herbal elements. On the tongue had something earthy and dank to take the edge off. Crisp and tangy, medium-light feel, moderate carbonation. Bright and zesty but with a rustic undertone. Classic. 2/14/17 canning."
"huge thanks to my new trade partner, rob (ak alexsergio) for the in person swap and the freshie trill. canned on valentine's day so just north of 2 weeks old. oh so trill...all hail the kings of the NE juice. brew literally looks like a glass of OJ. nose is magical and lift offs into wonder on my first sip. i've always loved scaled, scaled up and all the variants of...one of my favorite trill ipas and this is no let down. simply wonderful."
Light (neon yellow) extreme haze w/ a full fat mans finger of head. Redonk tropical nose. Redonk tropical flavor with some rind. Bitter pillowy feel (is that possible?). More and more I'm starting to believe trillium is the supreme in New England. Yeah...they are.
A 16 oz. can date 2-14-2017 poured into a TH Teku goblet. 
"Canned 02/14/17, so almost two weeks ago."
"Very hazy IPA with a wonderful aroma. The hops were nice and juicy and tasted most like pineapple to me. I'm not big into the hops but despite that, really enjoyed this one."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a hint of orange, two finger head that dissipates quickly and leaves nice lacing."
Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 2/14/17.
Consumed 2/23/17
This was the first beer that I ever had from Trillium so it will always hold a special place in my heart. Crazy how low the new ranking system has it on the Top 250 list!
"Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is big cracker, mango, and pineapple with light lemon juice. Light body and carbonation..slightly bitter and dry..Makes for a delicate and delicious ipa in the top half of Trillium beers..Well worth seeking out."
"A: hazed out light orange juice with foamy white bubbles head, sticky lacing. Its bright and milky"
"Scaled is great, double dry hopped scaled is better to me though. Nice crisp hop tastes coming through. Very dank. Almost like a mangoes and pineapples crushed into this. Awesome mouth feel."
Appearance - Pours cloudy orange color with nice thick white head lots of streaks of lacing down the glass.
"find the special fossil, hold it, behold it, its yours, its ours, let it be man... it is what it is, and it is super heady, a major hazy hoppy east coast juice machine, and if you are a carrot or a celery stalk or a potato or even a beet, brussel, or turnip, to hell with you and your high starch politics of anything but peace. you grew man, you grew together in the same plot, you rooted and diversified and pollenated and spread. invasive and proliferating, viral magnification, antibody absent, jim morrison blah blah, golden copulation and such. thats this, something you just cant have until you have it, and then its all meaningful and sacred. means something to me i know for sure. hard to overdose on hops, sort of like weed, this beer tries, but lupulin can be a double agent, a bond, shaken, not stirred, maybe there is a mission here. mission impossible? not for these hops. fire recipe and hugely successful execution. i have never been so stoked on a portfolio of hoppy beer as i have been with trillium, really special beers across the board. if we were in a bud light commercial i would ask you to ""beer me another""..."
On draft at Trillium (Canton).
"Had this back in early August a few times poured from a can. Looks like hazy juice and aroma is of citrus and tropical fruit. Taste is similar, very juicy, with slight bitterness on finish and a great mouthfeel. One of the better single IPAs I've had and great representation of NE IPA style."
Hazy with minimal head - looks like pineapple juice. Tropical fruit with floral notes and a bit of dankness. Some nice bitterness but very drinkable. Solid mouthfeel per the Trillium norm.
L - classic Trillium. A solid block of pale OJ haze. 
"Had this on 2016-09-16 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz can dated 2016-09-06 so it is very fresh."
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. 
Great brew. Love the citrusy nose on this beer thanks to citra and el dorado. The DDH that they did to an already great IPA just makes it that much more aromatic. Very smooth drinking brew
Revisited this one and a pleasant reminder that Trillium is just tops in this NE IPA brew IMO. Simply in another league when compared to other NE IPAs!
"Really hazy peach juice color with off-white head. Aroma is really juicy with lots of mango and pineapple. Taste starts with resiny hops and mango juicy. On the finish, a good amount of bitterness kicks in and lingers for a long time on the aftertaste with lots of grapefruit pith. Medium body and carbonation. Another great IPA from Trillium."
"Poured into a 13 oz Weyerbacher tulip glass canned on 8/2/16. Pours a murky yellow, can not see through it at all. With a 2 finger fluffy white head that leaves behind some spotty lace."
"A - Pours a hazy, opaque tan/gold color with a very sticky, bubbly, off white lacing ring."
The smell is straight juice as I cracked this can.
Service:	Can
"Probably my favorite Trillium of the night's tasting (there were five bottles/cans opened up). It shouldn't surprise me, considering the snuck Citra in with the rest of their delicious hops."
"Poured a hazy orange with tropical fruit aromas that filled the room. As with every DDH Trillium beer, the hop profiles were not sharp, but smooth and palatable with a ton of hop flavors coming through. Delicious"
Had this a few times and really enjoyed it. I preferred Scaled Up to this one as it is more juicy to me. Great hops and great profile in this beer. Hard to beat Trillium
"Bright hazy yellow-orange with a thin, white fizzy bubbly head."
"Pours cloudy yellow orange, thin bubbly head fades, not much lacing. Citrusy dank aroma, earthy hop notes, lemony dry finish. Woodsy notes throughout. Medium soft mouthfeel. Great brew, super dry and hoppy."
"Look: thick 1.5 inch head, lacing up the sides of the glass, beautiful mango orange hazy color. No light passing through it "
"Another great offering from the folks from Trillium. Incredible tropical nose. Taste comes across a little dry, which works well with the grapefruit, pineapple and pith. It also sets it apart a bit in what is becoming a very crowded NE style IPA field. Slight hop bitterness on the back end which seems appropriate for this beer. Heavy carbonation for an IPA, but it works in this case. Very refreshing. A great summer beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is an opaque, honey-yellow coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation feeding a clingy, foamy, white head. Aromas overflow as you pour, with notes of bright citrus, heavy on grapefruit, lemon, and orange rind, blended perfectly with candy-like tropical fruit aromas of kiwi, passion fruit, mango, and papaya. Very juicy, with only trace hints of bitterness. This literally smells like liquid candy. Flavors are very juicy, heavy on the citrus forward, with a bold splash of orange juice hitting the taste buds first. Solid mango and passion fruit blend follows, with only subtle bitterness peaking around the fringe here and there. Very juicy, low bitterness IPA. Delicious. The body is smooth and chewy, but never overbearing. The drinkability is through the roof on this beer. The aftertaste is all juice...like a liquid fruit cocktail, with a citrus base, of course. Slick, smooth, light finish, with a solid citrus linger. Great beer!"
"Super solid offering from trillium once again. I love their lighter ipas as the bigger beers can be kind of hot. This has none of that heat and offers a super juicy delicious experience. Huge floral nose. Expensive, but worth it"
Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstraw with the look and lacing I have come to expect from Trillium
"750ml brown bottle, purchased at Gordon's Wines in Boston, MA. This sample was in my beer fridge for an extra 10 days and much of the sediment had settled to the bottom. "
"Well this was a juice bomb. This really surprised me. Easily the 2nd best trillium beer after mosaic fort point. Hazy orange in appearance, smells and tastes like pureed pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, peaches and a touch of mango..creamy new England mouthfeel with a touch of bready malt on the end. Epic."
"Smells like tangerine orange juice. Awesome. Tangerine, tangeloes, lime, pine and mangoes. Standard double dry hopped dry, bitter finish. Earthy, pithy and grassy. Smells a bit better than it tastes. It's good."
Drank in a Trillium chalice on 6/8/2016
750ml bottle dated 05/24/16
"This beer pours a nice hazy yellow straw color with a nice white head. The smell is fantastic. Tropical citrus, pineapple. The flavor is just as great as the smell is. Lots of citrus and pineapple with a hint of melon at the finish. Mouthfeel is very nice. Overall this is an amazing beer which I will try to get again."
"The base beer was great, and adding El Dorado and Citra this should be fantastic! 5/24/16, quite fresh."
"WOW, poured from growler, its murky and as gorgeous as DDH congress. now for the smell: this ones like fort point with the big citrus, but with some weed, grassy note and a little bit of lime. taste is what I imagine if you mixed Melcher and fort point together, then dry hopped it with some dank hops. feel was great despite the lack of head. awesome awesome beer, might be my second or even favorite DDH offering from Trill."
"750ml bottle, stamped with what appears to be 05.24.16, poured into a Trillium snifter glass."
I have had a ton of DDH stuff from Trillium and every single one has been outstanding. It is great to have complete confidence when purchasing anything DDH from Trillium and knowing you are going to get a world class beer. Amazing.
"look: cloudy orange with a thick white head. Smell: smells like a fresh peeled orange, sweet citrus with a very slight hint of alcohol. taste: sweet citrus orange flesh with a bit of bitter orange rind, the bitterness seems to hide the alcohol. feel: typical trillium ipa, creamy with light to moderate carb. overall an awesome beer really happy i picked it up not quite up there with Artaic or DDHFP but i would definitely pick it up again."
Another amazing Trillium offering! I've had severs of the Trillium Double Dry Hopped offerings and I need to tell you that this one is the best by far!!!! Juicy as hell! Love this one!!! Glad I have another bottle left for the weekend!! :)
"This beer pours a cloudy completely opaque orange juice color with a huge rocky off white head. Retention is excellent and there are hanging sheets of lacing. Smell is a pineapple bomb with mango, tangerine, citrus pith and a slight dankness. Taste is the same. Feel is soft and juicy, very little bitterness. Overall what is there to help? Just another fantastic IPA from Trillium. So aromatic and flavorful."
"Double Dry Hopped Scaled growler fresh from the Canton Brewery, poured into a Proclamation tulip glass. Along the same lines of many Trillium Pale/IPAs - cloudy, aromatic, juicy, delicious. What makes this one different from say, Fort Point or Congress Street? Damned if I know. More hops = more expensive ($23/64oz). Someday I'll do a side-by-side and see if I can detect the nuance. But for now I'll enjoy another superb Trillium offering!"
Bottle poured into a snifter.
"oh my! super sweet aroma! creamy headiness! very juicy indeed! this stuff is beautiful..... it's like watching MJ hand the reins to Kobe, who hands them to Curry.... the evolution is exciting. these guys are today's king....."
"This one is really insane. That juicy look with some nice range in color from a lighter yellow to a golden hue. Great aromas here, dry, Citra hops come through. Ridiculous hop combo here really creates just the ideal mouthfeel for an IPA. Just clips Congress Street for the best IPA from Trillium I've had so far."
Poured into a Trillium tumbler from a bottle bottled on 1/19/16.
Yet another bottle of amazing juice from trillium. Full body full citrus fruit nose and absolute delicious hop bomb on the pallet. It's a well rounded ipa that needs no introduction
750ml bottle poured into a snifter.
"750 mL bottle. Pale orange body. Aroma is bright orange, wheat grain, lightly spicy hop aroma. Taste is bright orange. Very citrusy. I get a bright lemon component as well. Sweet pale malt. Wheaty grain. Medium body. Pretty sweet. Delicious."
So much juice
750ml bottle. Served in a snifter glass.
"The beer comes in an extremely rich, hazy deep gold."
"bottle from my man mark who was at the brewery the other day. born on January 19th, just under a month old. enjoyed from a trillium Willie becher. super hazy double dry hopped ipa from trillium...exactly what you'd expect, really juicy...great tropical fruit flavor...great sweaty ipa...dripping w wonderfulness."
"This poured out as a hazy golden color with a thick creamy looking head on top. The smell explodes with tropical fruit notes from all the hops. The taste of the beer is very nice too, subtle sweet maltiness up front which then gets washed away by all the hoppy goodness moments later. The feel is smooth and refreshing. Overall this beer is excellent."
"Just a lovely beer. Typical Trillium haziness is there. The nose is a bit muted compared to their other offerings, but the taste is just unique with the El Dorado hops taking the forefront and Citra and Columbus helping out on the back end. The mouthfeel is just killer, billowy, thick and rich. Overall, another killer Trillium brew."
From 02/06/15 notes. 22 oz bottle purchased at the brewery the day before. Poured into my Trillium tulip.
"Bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company in Boston, MA."
Poured from bomber purchased on Saturday at brewery.

"L - Classic hazy, unfiltered orange. Two fingers of white head."
L: Extremely hazy light honey and butterscotch hues with a generous white foamy head 
a dank juice bomb from Trill... awesome Haze orange color.. nose is big time citrus fruits.. mostly orange to me.. mouthfeel is fantastic.. and the flavor is top notch citrus rind and dankness.. JC is back on point
"Pours white orange and cloudy with a two finger head. Spells spicy and herbal, orange and citrus. Taste is bitter and sweet, smooth, can taste the orange /pineapple. El Dorado adds the spicy/peppery mouth-feel. The bitterness lingers a bit. Really nice DDH Trillium beer. They're all great."
Deeply hazy orange body with a persistent white foam that coats the glass with lace.
"My Trillium reviews are getting repetitive. Amazing pineapple, mango, tangerine juice bomb. No other brewery does IPA's, DIPA's and pales like Trillium. No one. #fanboy"
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA"
"A: Light gold, straw colored, thin white head."
Love cloudy soft looking DIPA's
Thanks Mike! 8 days old at time of drinking. 
"Bottled on 1/19/16 enjoyed on 1/23/16 Poured into a tulip glass, thanks Ryan for grabbin these for us."
"Smelling tangerine, Green mango, lemon skin, citrus, . It's a hop bomb with minimal hop bitterness. soft mouthfeel with an almost watery finish. Excellent beer."
Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Trillium snifter. Bottled 5 days ago on 19Jan16. Thank you Big Julius for picking this one up for me in Boston. 
1/19/16 bottling date. 4 days old!
"32oz growler poured into a 13oz tulip, filled on 1/21/16, reviewed same day."
"From bottle. Pours a hazy slightly darker orange. Two finger foamy white head with solid lacing. Retention is also solid. Fantastic smell that doesn't weaken. This one really brings the fresh pine on top of the citrus. Mostly pineapple and tangerine. Taste echoes the smell. A bitter pine leads an intense lime and pineapple. Some fruit rind and spot of earthy dank as well. Much dryer than their typical beer. A touch thinner and has a resiny stick. I really like this one. In line with their juice bombs, but it brings the bitter."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow/light orange color with a thick foamy head that dissipates. Still some head that lingers, lacing on the glass throughout drinking. Smell is tropical, citrusy fruits - aggressive lime, pineapple, juice. Taste reflects the same with the soft pineapple coming through behind the lime and hop bitterness. Super smooth mouthfeel. Excellent beer"
"Pours like orange juice; a very hazy pale orange with a finger of white head that leaves sticky lacing. Aroma is very heavy on the tropical fruits; mostly mango, some pineapple, and citrus and soft malts in the background. Taste is very, very juicy. Like the aroma its mostly tropical fruits and very heavy on the mango and leans towards sweet rather then bitter. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer, it's not without its flaws (dare I say too juicy?) but well done and an improvement on the original."
Pours a completely opaque bright golden orange color with a 2 finger fluffy white head. The head is gone quickly but leaves some beautiful cobweb lacing around the glass.
"Snagged a 4 pack dated 10-8 on the way back into MO from IL. Poured into the glass and it was an opaque amber color with a bit of white head. Fantastic tropical fruit aromas, that appear on the palate, then finish with a bit of a creamy aftertaste. This is a great NEIPA. Absolutely crushable, I would drink many more cans of this if it were in my state."

"16 oz can, canned on 10/12/18. Pours very murky dark yellow with a big frothy white head that retains well and laces the glass. "
16 oz can with an August 2018 canning date. 
"Pours a turbid light straw yellow with a frothy white head on heavy pour. Nose is of fragrant ripe fruit. Citrus and melon. Taste is of sweet ripe mango, peaches, citrus pith and light pineapple. A nice bit of sweet dough and wet grass to help break up the fruitiness. Medium body, semi creamy with a dry finish."
"Michigan haze! Available at the grocery store, too. That alone is enough for me to recommend. I don't think I've seen any mass produced hazy NE IPAs at my grocery store. But... does it live up to the hype?"
"Now that NEIPA is its own category, I think I get it. And M-43 does a very, very good job of fitting the bill of the new category."
Poured from a 16oz can with a packaged on date of 9/7/18; into a pub glass.
A better tasting oberon
"On tap: nailed smooth feel and added the citrus juice but missing some bitterness or bite in back, for me."
Just a delicious hazy IPA. Get it while you can
A: Hazy orange
The perfect summer beer.
"Pours murky orange/gold with a 2 finger head on aggressive pour. Aroma- pineapple, orange, fresh hops, peach, grapefruit. Taste- beautiful. Pineapple, peach, orange. Very delicious beer. Yeast too. Mouthfeel- nice and soft, fluffy. Overall- great job. Easy drinking and delicious. So low in perceived bitterness. Loving it."
Thanks Jim.
Apricot orange body. Cloudy. One and a half finger white head that dissipates quickly leaving not much lace.
Hands down my favorite beer. And I drink a lot of beer.
"i dont want to say that when these are good they all taste the same, because thats not really true and this is packed with nuance, but it seems like they are all trending pretty similar, and while its awesome that these guys have demonstrated with this one that yeah, they can do it too, the beer isnt really all that different, good as it is if this is your jam. its yellow and uniformly cloudy, not overly thick but without much transparency and only a small head on it. the aroma is killer though, wicked fresh, very fruity, i get lime and pineapple and mango and tangerine, oily and strong, like a weed extract of some kind, honey oil and the like, some floral element too, elderflower herbaceous and bitter, even a delicate sort of jasmine note lightening things up, really appealing, and most of what i smell is there in the taste too, very modern, very on trend, but also very good, cant hate on this. the flavor is great, still bitter enough to be an ipa i guess by todays standards, and there are some green tea and lemongrass notes to this that make it unique, a flash of honey sweetness too, and more carbonation than it looks like it can hold. a really great beer all up, i liked their greenstone pale just as much, still worthy of the hype, obviously a little of the homegrown michigan blind love pushing it up the ranks, homers abound, but its real good. honestly though, this style has about run its course i think, if this is as good as it gets i dont know where we go from here..."
7/21/18 can; packaged on 7/10/18
"Wow - You get to pay $16 for a four pack of beer full of the trub from the bottom a brewing keg. My bad- I have been scrubbing this crap out of the bottom of my home-brew kegs for years. Who knew some people would actually prefer to drink it, if it were trendy to do so. Next thing you know, restaurants will be serving us fruit and vegetables with dirt on them as a ""flavor booster."" I have been a hop head for 16 years and this beer does not deserve to be called an IPA. My message to the brewers: Enjoy the ride while it lasts, but soon folks will realize the emperor is not wearing any clothes."
Summer 2018 buy on a tip from Andy R. In Florida. Very summery beer. Tons of citrus and grapefruit. Would buy again for sure. This is the northern Jai Lai.
"It doesn't scream ""Look at me, I'm incredible!"" like the Midwest would like you to believe, but it's low-key fantastic. I would buy this off the shelf, but not search it out."
L: Pours a very hazy murky orange-yellow that is very reminiscent of grapefruit juice and comes with a very frothy creamy white head that leaves just a few specks of lacing on the glass. I usually find NE IPA's to be quite ugly but there is something about this one that makes it more appealing to look at.
Juicy with Amarillo on front and simco on back! 4/27/18
"L: Very hazy, juicy, peach-like color, one finger white head, messy lacing, no visible carbonation."
"Well, like Miranda Kerr in a 2 piece, I can see why this one is rated so high. When I opened the can, I was met with a Mount Pompeii explosion of tropical zest and aroma that every American dreams about when they are logging their 9-5. Taste is magnificent like Like Yul Brennar finishing a scene. I mean, this thing is ripe, pungent, and exploding with island fruits like Montgomery Clift in From Here to Eternity."
"Tasted from can. Pours a super murky dark yellow with thick white head. Aroma is all tropical fruit. Well balanced and really drinks like an imperial IPA. Flavors of papaya, guava, orange, melon, peach, mango, and a little resin. Awesome IPA."
"The best, most well balanced and rounded example of this style I've had to date. Bright and juicy hop aroma and taste with malt providing a backbone that doesn't outshine the hops. Smooth mouthfeel with just the right amount of crispness makes this beer feel like you're drinking a juice. An all around stellar choice if you're looking to try a solid NE IPA."
Packaged 5/31/18
"Murky yellow orange pour with a white head. Aroma is orange juice, tropical fruit, and some cracker. Taste is orange juice, mango, and some doughy yeast. Light bitterness in the finish. Chewy body. Very good."
"Bomb! Canned 6/1/18 drank 6/8/18. Balanced NEIPA and crushable. Citrus then peach/mango and fresh hops. At this point, my only negative is that it’s very “green” and grassy/herbal esp in the aftertaste. Juice bomb? Close. $5 a tall boy, def worth a single. I wouldn’t buy a 4-pack for $20 again. At least it’s not cloying, unbalanced or have lactose. Still tastes like beer. 94/100."
"Canned 5/21/18, exactly two weeks ago."
It is a hazy apricot color with a small white head. There is a good amount of lace.
"Light copper to dark gold with a very hazy complexion. There's a fingernail of off white. The aroma is of pineapple with a citrus edge. I'm tasting plenty of pineapple, green apple, mango, and pear. As it warms I'm getting some citrus, too. The mouth is dangerously smooth and quaffable."
"beautiful looking beer, glowing haze with a bright white head that leaves some great lacing. pretty aromatic and palate matches the aroma with some danky and green herbal quality, fruity, mellow sweetness and good texture. overall a really enjoyable IPA"
Pale yellow body that is a glowing golden orb. One of them bodies that the kids love these days. Nice finger or so of white foam.
"16oz can. Pours a hazy, murky burnt straw color with 2 inches of fluffy white head. Lots of lacing. Peach, grapefruit, orange, lime and mango. The taste leans more towards the citrus fruits. Lime, grapefruit and orange. Creamsicle, pineapple, peach and mango towards the end. Not much malt flavor. Creamy with low carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. Mild alcohol presence."
Closets beer to perfect
"This one is on the top 250 as the time I review it. It's great but honestly it far to be as good as some other examples of the style i've had in Europe, mostly from England. It's a lot on the citrus but also on the peach, the mango, the passion fruit and the pineapple. The citrus presence seems almost tart. The balance is there as the drinkability. I thought I'd have more complexity from this one"
"16 oz can. Pours a hazy golden with a white head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma and flavor are peach, citrus peel, tropical fruit, and malt. So glad its a available in my area. I could drink a lot of these."
"Been itching to try this and it hit the mark. I have an older batch, so I feel that I missed a lot of the scent of a fresh NEIPA. Everything else still worked though. Do not pass up if given the chance to get some."
look: Hazy peach. If orange juice was colored peach it would look like this. Fluffy white head on the pour that mostly recedes.
Remarkably smooth with mellow carbonation and nonexistent head.
Fantastic aroma of grapefruit and a hint of pineapple on the nose. Taste to match as the beer leads with a tropical fruits. Soft and supple mouthfeel with no hop bitterness to be found. Very good NE style IPA here. A real sleeper!
L: murkey urin but not in a bad way 
Pours a thick head that looks like whipped egg whites. Hazy gold color. Delightful taste of strong citrusy lemon and grapefruit with subtle malt floating in the background. A penultimate IPA of its class.
"Found this gem on tap. Delicious example of a New England-style IPA, nice hazy light color with floral and fruity scent. Nice clean notes of lemon and grapefruit, faint hints of biscuit and malt. Some medium hoppiness that comes through as the beer warms but never bitter or overpowering. Definitely considered “juicy” as citrus is balanced just right. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, proper amount of carbonation, excellent finish. Could drink this all day. Very pleasantly surprised."
"16 oz can dated 3/26/18 poured into a snifter. Looks like a NEIPA but slightly darker with an acorn color. Thick white head with nice lacing. Outstanding aroma right from the pour - tropical fruit, oranges, and also some earthiness. The taste lived up to it's reputation. Huge pineapple and orange flavors. A subtle dank, resiny undercurrent. The ""juiciest"" version of this style that I have had with mouth-watering following each sip. Pillowy soft feel. Fantastic."
This is a fantastic beer all around. A new favorite.
I correctly guessed the style from the NBS BIF. I could smell the hops and citrus from this beer. The beer is 48 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A one finger bright white head with fair retention. The head is creamy and airy and left a little lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 4 a light straw. The clarity of the beer is cloudy from the yeast. The beer presents with carbonation bubble on the glass. 
"Poured from fridge temp. Pours a murky orange with little white head. Nose is orange, lemon, pine, wheat, and hay. Smells refreshing. Taste is smooth - slight bitterness upfront, grapefruit, orange peel, wheat, leather, and pine. Mouthfeel is dry and medium bodied. Super refreshing with a hoppy bitter aftertaste."
"From Labirratorium. In Teku glass. Watching Logan. Very citrusy, even acidic, with a strong bitterness bitt that becomes particulary noticeable in the end. Nice but i prefer their boss tweed, which its stronger body helps in balancing it"
This has to be the best IPA I have ever had. It's so smooth and refreshing. I haven't found anything that comes close
Looks like OJ in a glass and feels like OJ in your mouth. Super citrusy with almost no bitterness. Have recently had this side by side with sip of sunshine and this is even less bitter without sacrificing the aroma and citrus flavor of the hops.
"Drinking from a can, so I can't comment on looks. Aroma is fruity and cirtrusy, one of the nicest smelling beers ever. However, taste is where this beer shines. Citrus fruits, pineapple, tropical flavors, with a nice background of subtle piney resin. The pine becomes more prominent as the beer warms a little. Not very bitter, just the perfect amount to counteract the sweetness. A tangy citrus finish that hangs around for a while. You will find it hard to believe that fruit was not used in the production of this beer. Overall it's excellent and a treat for IPA connoisseurs."
"Extremely hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma is not too intense, some overripe, slightly fermented citrus fruits and a light biscuity malt sweetness. Taste is fruity, citrusy, a bit tart, acidic, light bitterness, quite yeasty. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Not really what I expected."
"Pours a very hazy, greyish amber coloration that turns completely opaque, bright orange when held up to the light. Smells lovely of sweet tropical fruits: pineapple mango, papaya and zesty citrus fruit: grapefruit, tamgerine Taste is very bright and hoppy, with just a tiny hint of biscuity malt coming through as well. Notes of sweet tropical fruit and zesty citrus fruit: pineapple, mango, papaya, grapefruit, tangerine. There also a slightly dank grassiness and mild pineyness to this. Finishes with a light bitterness and acidity. Soft, smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonnation. Very nice NEIPA that starts off with the usual mix of sweet tropical/citrus fruits, but adds a mild grassy, dank and piney, even slightly peppery note to the mix and finishes with a moderate hop burn. Very enjoyable."
"Pours an absolutely opaque, pulpy, yellowish-light orange. Head production is excellent, and retention and lacing are quite good."
"Hands-down the finest NE Style IPA to ever fill my glass. And from Michigan. May be the calypso hops but there is something very unique about this beer. It’s got the fruity. Been there, done that–but there is herby, piney, floral notes I haven’t experienced in this style. I love the entire ride but the finish is outstanding."
"For this one, my CANtitude goes to @Mothergoose03 for not only sending me a load of Short's caps to be passed on to a local artist, but also CANcluding some locals in the package! I will be returning the favor! I love MichiCAN & its beers."
Best IPA I’ve ever had. Love the citrus and grapefruit that come through.
Citrus - absolutely
"One of the most hyped beers ever for me, finally in my glass. Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
"The good: We have a full bar in our basement and I keep it fully stocked with a wide variety of beers. One of a few that I make an effort to try and keep a good stock of is M-43 IPA, regardless of price (more on that later). I have to say that this is one of my favorite beers, among a few others. My wife even loves it and she's not much of a beer drinker but will have one on occasion. They are now selling this beer at my local grocer so that is great. I hope they keep it there. We'll see."
"This is a difficult review to write. I feel it is impossible to provide an unbiased review given this is hands down the best beer I have drank. This is one of the very few beers I would ever consider paying the hefty price, especially with how this beer changes the expectations of an IPA. Hints of a traditional New England IPA, and pours with a bright orange color and thick cloudy body. The oatmeal in the mash helps provide the opaque body with a nice thick mouthful on the palate. The smell is unbelievably bright, and obviously was dry hopped with an overwhelming amount of hops. Beautiful Citra notes that deliver a light and crisp beer with a bright hoppy flavor. I can not praise this beer enough. I would be content drinking this beer, and this beer only for the rest of my life. Pour, sip, enjoy."
"Looks like a fuzzy navel with a thin, white head."
"Very sour flavor. Tastes like fermented fruit. Smells like dirty 4 day old warn socks. Ever play football during high school 2-a-days? Yeah, got that same sense from this beer. Very disappointed with this beer from all the rave reviews. Seems like a fad that will fade in a few years. Flavorful Five owns this beer hands down. Onto the next one. Won't be buying another one."
Look - super cloudy whitish yellow color with a slight head and sticky lacing
Really nice for the style.....reminds me a lot of Bearded Iris or Battery Steele offerings. Lots of OJ and grassy earthy notes. A tick below Hill/Trill/Tree/Bissell
"L: Definitely looks the part for the style. Looks like a freshly made tropical fruit juice. Orange colored with yellow highlights, originally poured a big head but it fades away, some lace. Very turbid, almost milky. "
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Thanks Ryan for getting me this!
"Can. Pours with imposing turbidity. Aroma is sweet fruits and apricot jam. Purely a NEIPA. Nose is very lush but doesn’t jump out of the glass like some of the best. The aroma is excellent but it needs a little more pop. Flavor is better! Woah. Fruit flesh is the first thing that comes to mind. Passion fruit, strawberry, pineapple. Tangy. Reminiscent of Bissell Bro’s Swish - which I love. This is much better than many I’ve had and I live in the Mecca. I’ve fallen off this style considerably but this one makes me want to dive back in."
"This beer stands out because there are so many people throwing the term ""NE IPA"" on their product when they are anything but. This one however might not be the same level as Trillium, TH etc. but it is at least in the style and a damned good beer."
"I thought this was absolutely outstanding when I tried it for the first time recently! Perfect representation of what I think NEIPA is supposed to be---and then I tried Boss Tweed, and that one topped even M43!! Wish I could get more of these!!!"
"Poured can from January 14. Not a fan of the look...murky but the color isn’t bright. Very dull orange. Aroma is nice...citrus and tropical. Flavor is where this shines. Really juicy ipa. Citrus and tropical flavors are prevalent. Feel is pretty full bodied for an ipa and I like it. Really sticks. Overall, this is really good. Pretty fantastic ipa."
Best neipa i've had.
"Poured from 16-ounce can into a tulip glass. Lovely appearance, an opaque, hazy, almost milky pale yellow color, with a thin white head due to a tentative pour. Lots of sticky lacing.. This is a juice bomb, and that is by no means a bad thing. Big aromas and flavors of orange juice, a juicy mouthfeel, and an orange-juicy aftertaste dominate the profile. There is also an orange-zest component to the bitterness. The oats in the grain bill provide lots of body while allowing the hop character to shine. The finish is quite dry and a little astringent, with a touch of orange zest lingering on the palate. Not sure how this compares with other NEIPA's, but this is outstanding on its own. Well done!"
Looks are amazing. Nice finger worth of frothy light golden colored head and the beer is completely hazy. Doesn't even look like orange juice just looks like a smoothie. 
Great looking Hazy beer. Nice carbonation. Good head and lace. Sod orange color. 
"Looks yellow with a little orange, very hazy."
16oz can into Nonic Pint
Appearance: poured a hazy grapefruit juice color with a white frothy head. No translucence. At least a couple mm of thick head retains till the glass is empty.
Got that super hazy NEIPA look
16 oz. can dated 11/26/17
Poured from the can. Was a 'secret santa' gift shipped to me in CA.
"This is a unique and incredible beer. One could almost mistake it for orange juice when pouring if not for the clean white head that forms. As soon as the can was opened, the citrus aromas filled the room with beautiful notes of grapefruit and orange. The beer fills your mouth with carbonated goodness that is oh so satisfying, and the flavors can't be competed with, perfectly balances the fruity notes with the hops. Absolutely one of the best citrus IPAs on the market."
Pour: pulpy thick orange pineapple juice. Thick sticky head that leaves lacing all around the glass.
"Taste: complex, refreshing, floral,citrus, grassy, hops with wheat, corn oats to round it off, and slight sweet notes as well. Same with the nose. Straw color, unfiltered haze, with tall white head and multiple ring lattice. Medium body. Many hops use and tangy tropical Calypso hops too. 65 IBUs"
2017-11-24
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy golden straw yellow body, one finger white head, good retention, cloudy with nice lacing. Smell is juicy canteloupe, grapefruit, passion fruit and even a bit of pine; juicy and aromatic for sure. Flavour follows, not much in way of caramel malt at all which is great. The flavour is mostly juicy and sticky orange pulp, grapefruit and canteloupe. Minimal grapefruit zest bitterness on the backend. Light caramel to keep things reasonable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, really nice drinking IPA. Well damn, this is pretty dang good."
Outstanding blend of citrus fruits and hops. Not too bitter and not too sour and it's a near perfect citrus IPA.
This is straight joos. As good as many Trillium offerings
"Thanks to rkitchen for this 16 oz. can, my first sip of Old Nation. Time for a good old (or new) IPA after 12 bottles of Darkness on Saturday night. Eiza. My blud sugar is still three times normal. "
Appearance - The beer pouring the color of murky orange juice. 
Canned 8/12.
Appearance - Pours super turbid looks like thick orange juice with a huge sticky head that lasts forever. Spotty lacing all around the glass.
The absolute best I have had so far in the NE style category of craft!
"Pours a beautiful bold white-orange haze with a one finger head with tight tiny bubbles. Smells very tropical, sweet and juicy, pineapple juice and damp grassy rain. Taste is smooth, juicy with some faint disguised bitterness. Very juicy, very tropical. Well balanced and drinkable. Great example of the style, true to form."
"16oz can, freshly purchased at the brewery, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 07.08.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
Had on Killgore’s golf trip weekend Nov 2016
"Cloudy, soft yellow body; looks like grapefruit juice; thick, rocky, sticky head. Strong citrus aroma; tangerine and orange; grapefruit. The flavors blend together in a rich, dense manner; fine cereal grain (wheat-like) with a rather dull, fruity quality; somewhat tart; seems like some phenol-like bitterness near the finish. Creamy, dry and acidic mouthfeel yet with a nice softness overall."
A-Super hazy NEIPA dark yellow with a white head that does not linger long
L: Hazy yellow much like a tropical juice with decent retention and lacing 
"Extremely turbid yellow orange in color. Frothy white foam with excellent retention. Some chunks settle to the bottom. The aroma is excellent. Orange, grapefruit, tropical fruit. The taste follows with the same notes. Body is medium, moderate carbonation, and soft mouthfeel. Low level of bitterness, but enough to balance the beer. Overall, an excellent NEIPA from Old Nation!"
Ca nned on Date 10-10- 2017! Pours a turbid gold with a thumb of cream colored head
Very solid IPA. Easy to drink with a great mouth feel and just the right hop flavor
"Pours a bright, but hazy, sunny yellow with a half finger of foam, appearance is very juicy!"
Very good beer. I'll star with what I liked a lot:
From a can dated 10/02/17.
all I can say is wow! rivals to heady topper in terms of flavour but on the sweeter side. an absolute quality beer.worth the price.
Lots of variety hop wise in the nose. Straight orange juice here. Tons of citrus without any negative hop protein burn. This one will go toe to toe with any of the big hype East Coast IPAs. Impressive as hell. Even though this one is getting a little bit of hype I believe it is still flying way under the radar. If I have this available to me locally it would always be in my fridge.
"Dense, thick, light color. Odd. Good nose. Thick mouth feel, heavy. Good taste. Would love a hoppier finish."
"Ugly murky orange pour, good sized white head, small specks of lace. Aroma is fruit forward - Melon, guava, light peach notes. Hop-forward taste, melon, guava, lighter mango and peach notes, resinous, very light cracker-like malt. Finishes dry. Medium body."
"nice pour, bright sunny d look with a super frothy top. All murky juice looking back at me. Aroma is pretty much resin and grapefruit, some softer notes of stone fruit. Taste follows the nose, it's earthy first and tropical second. breadcrumbs and grapefruit. It's super crushable, the abc is hidden well, medium carb, zesty finish. Overall a good beer, happy to try it but I probably wouldn't go out of my way again to trade for it."
16oz can poured into a tulip
Easiest drinking IPA I ever had. Totally different look....cloudy beer. I guess that's normal for this beer so whatever. Delicious taste. I seriously could chug this beer it's so easy drinking. Not as much aroma as some hop bombs. Four 16oz cans cost me $15. Is buy it again.
Gifted by a friend (Thanks Tim)
16 FL. OZ. can
"My friend bought this beer while it was still hard to get. We thought it was just another old trendy IPA. Didn't have any clue what a NE IPA was. This has been my favorite beer since. Still searching for a NE IPA as good as M43. Most of the brew pubs around MI have a NE IPA now, but none come close to the taste of M43."
"Creamy, smooth, floral and fruity, the New England style IPA of Old Nation hits on all cylinders on the backs off Calypso, Simcoe, Amarillo and Citra hops. With this bend, excellence is expected."
"This beer checks all the boxes of being in the NE-IPA class. Tons of tropical and citrus fruit smells and flavors, I was just left wanting more of a hop presence. This beer is VERY sweet, definitely too sweet for me - as I couldn't finish one can. On the end of each sip, it's very sweet, almost sugary - that's where I'm looking for the hops to come in to leave that burn on my palate. I'd be interested in trying another batch of this, but I won't be seeking it out regularly."
Appearance: Arrives at the bar cloudy and honey colored with a one finger head; clusters of lacing linger
"Canned 7/7, might have faded a little. Looks like straight up juice, slight foam and lacing, cloudy and hazy. Not getting much on the smell, but there's still plenty of juiciness to the taste, with a mild dank/bitterness on the back. Really tasty and enjoyable."
"7/13 can, poured into nonic pint glass"
On tap at the brewery.
Excellent.
"This is a cloudy, fruity pour that is unlike any other beer that I've tried. The hoppiness is complex enough to make this beer scream ""I'm an IPA!"" The fruit is all over the map -- hard to nail down, but perfectly in balance with the hops. Lastly, the body is not-too-heavy to make this an overall great summer beer."
"Very drinkable, keeps growing on me"
Poured into a 13 oz teku glass canned on 7/13/17. Pours a murky bright yellow with a solid 2 finger stick off white head that leaves thin wisps of lace all over the place.
"16 oz can August 9, 2017."
Canned on July 21 2017
Pours a matte orange color. Completely opaque and hazy. Thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a thin white head and lots of sticky white lacing. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass.
From can into teku.
"Poured out as a hazy yellowish color with creamy white head on top. The smell of the beer is fruity, very tropical aroma. The taste of the beer has a very nice tropical fruity flavor with subtle tangy bitterness to it. The feel is creamy and smooth. Overall it's a very nice beer!"
"Serving: 16 Fl. Oz. can poured into a Founder's Harvest Fest pint. Canned on 7/14/17, making this just under 2 weeks old."
"Short Review. I've been wanting to try this one for a while so I was happy to finally find a fresh can. It's very good and just what I would expect from the style, the color was turbid and just how most of these new england style DIPAs tend to look. The smell was very hoppy and juicy. The taste is very juicy and fruity with some green hops showing up in the background with just enough malt flavors showing up. Mouthfeel was just what I would expect from a DIPA and overall I thought it really did a good job at delivering a very juicy and fruit DIPA. I will for sure pick more up whenever i find some more fresh cans. I really like this one it's easily my favorite beer from Old Nation."
Thanks to Prager62 for this MI gem. Canned 06/30/17
great taste if your into the juicy NE style IPAs. smell very fruity. good mouth feel and body.
"People on the coasts don't know it, but ""New England"" style IPAs aren't exactly easy to get ahold of when you're somewhere in between. I have the privilege of being a no-coaster myself, but I got a chance to overindulge last summer on a trip to Boston and Vermont. When I saw a 4-pack of ""N.E. India Pale Ale"" in my new home of Ann Arbor, even the $16 price tag didn't deter me."
"Finally got some! Tried a 16 ounce can. Four packs were $13.99 at Meijer in Stevensville Michigan on 7/11/17. I'm not into the cloudy IPA look, and this was probably the most cloudy, but the smells and tastes totally made up for it! Definitely a top IPA of all time."
Pours a reddish orange opaque hazy color with a 1 inch head with nice lacing. Smells of orange juice and mango. Nice up front resinous taste followed by a papaya mud palate and a nice mild bitterness on the end. Nice thick mouthfeel. Well done!
"16 oz. can. Hazy and murky orange. Smells citrusy. Lots of oats. Tastes really oaty also. Bright citrus and orange. Back end is acidic, like grapefruit tartness. Chewy body. Medium carbonation. No bitterness, which I really miss. Just comes off as kinda sweet and acidic."
Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Clearly citrus aroma without any hint of hops. Taste is a very pleasant citrus with a mild hoppy accent.
"A - Hazy white-orange body, largely milky opaque, persistent white head, extensive lacing, thin with tight bubbles."
"I'm putting this on the same scale as Treehouse, Trillium, and Veil. It has the same soft pillowy mouthfeel, same juicy nose and taste, same hazy appearance, and you can drink it all day along without growing tired of it."
16oz tallboy can. canned on 05/31/2017.
"As expected, thus beer is extremely hazy (can't see through it) and a pale yellow amber. There was minimal head by the time the beer reached the table. Although the taste was strong with hops, it was also quite sweet. The body was thick and juicy (as expected). "
"Looks, smells and tastes like the great brews in Vermont."
Ladies and gentleman boys and girl. This is currently the super hyped Michigan IPA of the world considering they took from the new england style. Let's just do it.
Had my first can of this over Memorial Day weekend and was excellent. Dated 4-26. Sad that I only had 1 can from this date in the trade. The next 4 cans of this beer in the trade were dated 5-3 and it was not the same beer at all. Different color and completely different taste. Highly doubt a week of different canning dates changes this beer that much. Will grade accordingly when they get consistent at brewing it.
"My first beer from these guys, I hadn't even heard of them a month or so ago. The pour produces the obligatory pineapple milkshake appearance associated with the NE-IPA style: a turbid, murky straw color with a finger or so of off-white head."
Acquired a can as an extra in a beer trade
"2nd can to come my way within a week...first was extremely underwhelming...this one, however, is pretty rad (and I never say rad....I loathe people who say rad in fact. it's the equivalent shitty term to me as ""cool beans""....) but I digress...and interestingly..."
Thank you Doug537 for this
"Orange-yellow baby food in a glass--it really does appear just about as thick, viscous and still--if not for the thick, bubbly off-white foam on top."
had on 5/13/2017 and 7/8/17
Canned 5/3/17; drank 5/14/17 @ the Yarchives. 
Nice & juicy! Yum!
"Served on tap in a 10 oz goblet. Pouris the color of pulpy pineapple juice, and just as hazy. A finger of foam floats on the surface. Aromas and flavors are both big: juicy grapefruit and orange, followed by mango and pineapple, tropical cocktail syrup. As easy to gulp as morning juice. Slight hits of grapefruit pith."
Fresh can poured into a fluted snifter.
Thanks to @amirtrombley for the trade!
"Had on tap. A beautiful beer through and through. Juicy with citrus and tropical fruits, that go perfectly with the hop profile. Yet extremely drinkable and light for the style. Very enjoyable"
"Came in a goblet a deeply hazed almost milky orange tinged lemon yellow with a sticky half finger bone white head atop.Big tropical fruits in the nose,like a fresh squeezed tangerine and overripe pineapple,some floral notes as well,just bursting with fruits.Passion fruit and tangerine jump out on the palate with a slight grassiness coming thru in the finish,there is a sweetish doughy malt underneath the big hops,minimal bitterness.An IPA that almost drinks like a citrus punch,awesome!"
"L: Dark, hazy honeycomb, pumpkin, and orange/banana/pineapple juice hues with a healthy white head"
"Pours a cloudy, opaque honey orange with a finger of white head. Head retention is fair, with good lacing left behind. Aroma is a lively conjunction of citrus notes - orange, clementine, grapefruit, and papaya. Flavor profile isn't so pronounced, but still features juicy notes of orange, and clementine with a grapefruit finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth feel. Overall, it's incredibly juicy, with pleasant notes all around. "
"Reviewing this on 6/25/17 from a can dated 5/31/17, so a little over 3 weeks old. Previously just left a rating before 4.54, but after having this again I had to say a few words. "
From a 16oz can that has M43-08 stamped on the bottom 
"I think Old Nation did it and did it well. This is a true New England style IPA, Orange, Hazy, fruity, juicy, and hoppy. Nice foamy lasting white head, and plenty of grapefruit, orange, and mango to go around the nose and palate."
"Beautiful look to this, bright yellow orange. Haze for days! Orange peels, some lemon...delicious. Seek this one out."
"Canned 8/9/17, poured into a 16 pint glass."
Received this beer in trade. Reviewing from memory.
Poured from a can into a snifter. Can date not evident.
"The beer pours out like a typical looking NEIPA with a great amount of lacing left behind. When opening the can I had a strong pop of hoppiness blow in my face. After the initial smell I picked up pineapple, some orange/citrus, and a little sweet malt breadiness. The taste is much more intense with a ton of Orange, slight pineaple, little mango and a lovely pellet hop lingering aftertast. Feel is so soft I can not really feel the carbonation of the beer. Overall the beer is well made no alcohol detection, supper fresh and intense hop flavor. This beer is a must try for IPA lovers, Cheers!"
Poured 16oz into tulip:
Beautiful gold orange hazy cloud. 
"Look is that of a top-shelf NE IPA. Nice, cloudy, yellowish color. Aroma is piney, hoppy and inviting. Initial taste is good, but then the finish is awful. The tanginess and feel combine to make it seem like you are literally drinking orange juice. This been has a lot of promise, but needs some serious work."
"Look- heavy, cloudy, dark golden orange, light white foam. "
A pint can with no visible date given to me by a generous person in line at the Four Fathers anniversary bash in Valparaiso. I'm pouring it in a 13oz. tulip glass. 
Purchased on 4/13/17 the day my bottle shop received it and drank on 4/14/17
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 1/18/2018. Pours opaquely hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, wheat, biscuit, white bread dough, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. A little muted. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, wheat, biscuit, white bread dough, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild pine, grassy. citrus peel bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange peel, light pepper/pine, wheat, biscuit, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.8%. Overall this is an incredible NE IPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; extremely smooth and easy to drink with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Very dank/juicy hops, with perfect malt balance. Never overly sweet/heavy feeling for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing style example. Has definitely improved on mouthfeel than the first few batches I had, exceptionally soft and not as drying on the lingering bitterness."
"Seriously, the best beer in Michigan."
32oz crowler from LambicPentameter (thanks man!). Filled 3/17/17. Served in a Wicked Weed snifter. 
Incredible New England IPA. Thankful this is available in MI
"Lovely, hazy, golden, straw, creamy head. Smells like sweet tropical fruits, a little bit of grapefruit, maybe some pineapple acidity. Fizzy and fluffy, super smooth drinking. I am so used to DIPA, this is a lovely change! Flavor is fruity and a little bitter, great balance. Maybe blueberry on the end? Grapefruit and papaya."
Pours a turbid golden orange color with over a finger of an off-white head. A haze bomb.
"from a growler purchased at sidetrack in Ypsilanti, MI"
A: looks like schmaltz mixed with orange juice and a singer's width of white foam
"look-pours a bright cloudy orange, has the appearance of applsauce in the cup"
"It's been awhile since my last review, but having had this ""NE style"" IPA offering a few different times now, I felt compelled to preach the gospel of one of Michigan's best entries into the market space. Enjoyed on tap at Sidetrack in Ypsilanti and served in a classic pint-sized tumbler glass. "
Best NE IPA I have had from Michigan! Nicely done!!
"I haven't had a new beer that made me say ""wow!"" in a while. Enter Old Nation M43. Does it have it's flaws? Sure. But it's by far one of the best new IPAs around, and certainly within the top 5 coming out of MI. Pours like orange juice with a 2+ finger head. Juicy, resinous, floral notes in both smell and taste. Mouthfeel is just right. Definitely seek out this beer if you can."
Smell: juicy citrus and tropical fruits. Orange tangerine sweet grapefruit pineapple and mango. Sweet malt and some herbaceousness.
"Was a little skeptical to try this ""New England "" style, intentionally hazy IPA brewed in some hamlet of Lansing off I-96. "
"Pours hazy orange gold. Thick, medium, white head that lasts throughout."
Poured into 9oz glass fresh from the keg at craft breww city. 
"A - Extremely hazy the color of orange-pineapple juice with a thin, white, frothy head."
"Hazy golden body like dirty looking orange juice. Cloudy as hell. Small white head which settles but never disappears. Sticky soapy lacing thru out. Smells of tropical fruits. Oranges, pineapples, melons and juicy hops."
"A great NE style IPA from middle of Michigan. Big orange juice vibes. Cloudy gold pour with huge citrus aromas. Big sweet citrus on the attack, and fades to a hint of bitter zest at the end. Soft texture keeps the flavors lingering. Very refreshing."
"I don't live in the great northeast to be able to have easy access to Trillium, Tree House, Lawson's or Bissel but have been fortunate to try some of there offerings through numerous trades. This M-43 is legit hazy hoppy a serious juice bomb blind fold me and put a M-43 in front me and I would tell you I'm drinking a Trillium! Yeah it's that good! If u live in Michigan and are close to Old Nation you really need to make the trip!!"
"Had a bunch of Trillium, Treehouse, Lawsons, Tired hands, Fiddlehead, Grimm. This is right there in that style. Amazing to have a good NE style IPA in MI. Hope this gets better distro so the world can see for itself. Cheers to the ON crew on this great juicy beer. If they dial in a DIPA like this it would compete with the best. Crushable."
On tap. This is that hazy juice bomb unfiltered trillium treehouse shit. Hazy and all juice. So good. Orange for days and thick. Order one if you see it. First pour from a baby keg. Ignore your Old Nation bias and run for this
A - Pours a very hazy golden orange with a one finger white head. Tons of soapy lacing.
"This is the proverbial ""shit"" right now in Michigan. When I saw it available at Michigan Beer Growler Company, I figured I should get myself a Howler and give it a whirl."
Look: This beauty pours a beautiful gold with a distinct cloudy appearance and a strong white head about 1/2“ thick. The cloudiness comes from the oats added to the malt build along with the heavy dose of dry hops.
On tap.
"This was super smooth for 8% ABV. None of the flavors overpowered any others and for it being my first beer from Grimm, I was super impressed. Poured from a 16 ounce can into a stemmed IPA glass."
"When a beer is superb, my eyes tend to close to better experience great flavor. This one is an eye-closer. Looks so much like hazy, citrus juice in the glass, you almost expect to encounter pulp. Multiple hop flavors come at you in succession, including a long, luxurious pine run out that doesn't quit. Brilliant!"
CAN
Hints of pine with slightly more prevelant notes of lemon and mango. 
Can thanks to Jon
Canned 3/16/18; drank 4/27/18 @ the Yarchives. 
Don’t have time to rate. But had at Waltham Tap and Table. This beer is awesome. Please bring more....love this brewery
"A: The beer is very hazy light yellow in color. It poured with a finger high bright white head that gradually died down, leaving a thin head covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge of the glass, and some lacing clinging to the sides."
nice can
So drinkable. Perfectly balanced and way too easy to drink. My favorite Grimm IPA to date.
"Pours a lightly hazy golden hue. Not as frothy dense as a lot of the fruitier IPAs of the Northeast. Peach and grapefruit aroma. Getting a lot of candied grapefruit, some peach, and strawberry. It's a little on the thin side. It's not super complex or have a myriad of cascading flavors. Pleasant enough to drink and I did enjoy this, despite any unimpressed tone I may have imbued in this review."
First beer I've had from Grimm! Canned on date 03/03/2017.
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits. Pretty well balanced. Orange, mango, pineapple, lemon, some pine and resin. Very well done imperial IPA."
Absolute favorite Grimm
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a slightly hazy burnt orange color with a cap of a little white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace. Sly lace. The aroma had some mango sweetness and citrusy pulpy sweet to bitterness. Light grassiness, semi-smooth and sweet. Touch of lemon at the very end. The flavor had some bright juicy sweet to bitter qualities forming over a slight clean malt feature. Aftertaste was bright juicy citrus and tropical tastes. Finish was sweet through the juiciness. The palate was about medium bodied with a slight sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, damn good DIPA."
Scored a growler of this at an amazing pkg store in Asheville NC a few days ago. Now I am drinking it and I am a very happy camper. One of my favorite breweries and this is a freekin' amazing beer. Sorry I am traveling and can't share this with some friends. NOT!!!!!
Way more malty than i expected. Old school DIPA like a DogFish 90. Guess I'm spoiled by all the great NE Style IPAs I am getting in the RVA
"10 ounce pour in a tulip at Appalachian Vintner in Asheville, NC."
"This Imperial IPA pours to a medium, creamy white head on a very hazy, very effervescent golden body; head retention is modest and lacing is excellent, consisting of thick bands and ladders. The aroma is a big, tasty blend of bright, fermented pineapple and cannabis backed by more subdued bright grapefruit and hints of perfume, tamarind and body odor; alcohol overtones are modest. Up front, the flavor is medium-bitter pineapple and grapefruit with a hint of grassiness. Mid-palate, hints of tamarind and perfume join the fruit and the malt rolls in, as we get a good view of the bready malt foundation and some modest caramel and nutty notes; perceived bitterness rolls back to moderate-for-style. The finish is a light hit of grassy tamarind and booze, followed by the onset of a modest, slightly caramelly, grassy pine bitterness that lasts for awhile. Retrogustative olfaction is grassy and cannabis-like. Mouthfeel is commensurate with the light-medium body, and is notably astringent; the texture is medium-creamy and slightly peppery from the somewhat understated carbonation. (growler, 35 days after kegging)"
"Golden yellow, pretty opaque, moderate head. Lots of dry hop cone on the nose, grapefruit rind. Pretty bitter, lots of grapefruit and bitter citrus. Dry chalky Amarillo and simcoe. A little sweetness, crystal malt. Fine but could have used a better backbone and diversity in flavor"
Canned 3/3/17. 
Great IPA . Just as described.
Poured from a 16oz can into a large goblet glass. Thanks Ryan for hooking me up with this. 
Poured from 16 oz can dated 3/10/2017. Big thanks to @cavedave!
A: clear marigold in color with a big frothy white head
"Bright orange and not completely hazy, more translucent. Nose is very inviting and pungent tropical juicy with some sweetness. Taste follows with a nice slight hops on the finish, solid mouthfeel and little creaminess to it. Another solid Grimm brew."
"It has been rare that I get a couple of cans of Grimm's IIPA's lately, so a big thanks to Carmine Street Tap Room for making it possible. "
Overrated.
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (Jester King stem piece). This was canned on March 3, 2017, making it 16 days old at the time of consumption. (Based on black ink packaging info, printed on the underside of the can: “CANNED ON 03/03/17 09:03:09”.) It’s been refrigerated for several days, and rolled around gently before drinking, as per the brewer’s suggestion. "
"Fresh can. Nothing special. Lemon, pineapple, tropical. Great beer but overrated"
"Currently #146 in the Top 250, the highest ranked of the five Grimm beers currently on the list. Moreover, this is currently #5 in the Top 100 for New York state. My hopes are high as a result..."
The nose jumps out at you as soon as you open the can! Full of tropical fruit and hoppy dankness. Poured a slightly murky golden orange color with over a fingers worth of foamy white head that laces the glass. This is a juice bomb for sure. Tons of sweetness and a slight bitter finish. Another outstanding IPA from Grimm. Feel like I say that a lot but they keep making great beer.
Canned 3/3/17. Drank out of a TEKU. Beer pours out a deep gold/orange in color with a medium to medium minus haze and soapy bright white head. Aroma definitely has that charactaristic GRIMM sweetness with lots of Pineapple and Peaches along with a good amount of oniony dankness. Aroma translates to the palate along with a medium to medium plus vinous bitterness like chewing on grape stems. Solid medium mouthfeel in line with it's ABV. A solid overall offering from GRIMM that blends tropical NE flavors with plenty of bitterness. 93 points.
Really nice to see Grimm make some great IPA's. Nice golden color with a perfect nose of hops and juice. Amazingly smooth and the taste of the bitter hops was really good.
"Paired with a spicy jerk pork burrito, made the afteimage pop even more."
Poured from a can into a snifter glass. I got this in a trade from crowlcrowlcrowl. 
"Pours golden with nice lacing. Aroma is tropical fruits and citrus. Taste candy malts, tropical fruit, candied guava papaya tropical citrus, little tangerine and light apricot like, light spicy hop. Finish hops and citrus. Very complex and well made."
"This tastes like melon and sweet fruit, only very slightly bitter. It has a wet finish, but feels very slightly dry after swallowing. Extremely enjoyable beer."
Thanks to JLindros for sharing.
Can shared with rudzud
Was finally able to track down a can of this from the most recent batch so I could check it off my list! Solid DIPA from Grimm who is killing it in the sour and IPA realms!!
Only been lucky enough to have a couple brews from Grimm. So far so good.
"First Grimm offering for me and a great start. On tap at Tip Tap Room in Boston, served in tulip glass. Boozy for 8% but some subdued passionfruit and kiwi flavors seem to creep in as it warms. Hard to put down. Price is steep at $11 a pint but this one is getting me excited to visit the brewery and try their other hoppy offerings. Next level!!!"
"Came a slight hazed tangerine-like color with a thinner white head atop.Juicy citrus fruits abound in the nose with some underlying floral notes,the fruitiest hop aromas I have come across I think.Flavors are almost like a tropical punch,mango,overripe pineapple,and orange really hit home with very little bitterness and /or big alcohol sweetness.The beer doesn't seem to be as big as it is,immensely drinkable and a joy to drink,great beer."
Easily on par with the best beers I've had. Compared closely to Heady Topper and Sip Of Sunshine. Fantastic!!
"Canned 8/17. This is probably my 8th or 9th IPA from Grimm. Gorgeous hazy light gold/orange. Smells like it tastes, sweet cotton candy with some passion & stone fruit and some bitterness to follow, All in great balance. This is one of Grimm's offerings that reminds me how incredible these guys are at making beer, however I will say Tesseract still holds the spot for my #1 IPA."
Canned 8/17/16. Consumed 8/29/16.
"The hype is a little much. This is an excellent, well-balanced double IPA, but not world class, and probably not worth the effort of trying to track it down. There are better, more accessible big ipas in nyc."
"Just a step behind Tree House's IPAs, but pretty close. Got a ton of mango flavor and maybe a little bit of lemon. Hops were solid but took a back seat to the fruitiness. Probably my favorite Grimm IPA."
This batch is a notch down from the last IMHP
This beer reminds me a lot of The Alchemist double IPAs.
16oz can into snifter
"Picked this up a while back in New York, finally getting around to this tonight. Canned on 3/8 but still tasting fresh and without a lot of (big) floaties in this. Loved the other Grimm Ales that I've had and once again, this was a ""meal in a can"" as this took a while to savor but only because this was so complex in flavor that I had to let it fully warm up. Beer like this demands a big block of time to enjoy it and to admire the Tommy Boy Records-like label!"
"Hazy, dirty gold color. Modest head that settles to fine layer of minute bubbles. A partial blanket of bubbles on the glass for lace."
Very nice
"Hop bomb milkshake. Probably my favorite Grimm IPA to date. Turbid hoppy haze, nice hop bite with a super smooth creamy finish. Even after a couple weeks on the can, still tasting amazing...."
"A very interesting brew. I had it first on tap in Brooklyn, and then again tonight from a can at a pizza joint near Union Square. Poured from a can dated 3/8/16 into a Teku glass."
Another stellar IPA from Grimm. That couple from Brooklyn is making some incredible brews and this is a perfect example. Nice hop hit up front and then excellent fruity flavor. One of my faves. Damn this is one tasty brew. Cheers
Great color little haze was great beer overall just left me wanting more
A pint can dated 03/08/16 from the very generous BA cavedave in the latest NBS/BIF poured in my 13oz. tulip glass. 
Excellent IPA. One of the few I actually thought was better a month later than the first week it was brewed.
"Pours clear, light yellow in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is grapefruit, grassy hops, citrus, and a bunch of melon that appears as it warms. Tasty and unusual. While I prefer some IPAs more, this one is well worth a try. Nicely done."
"From a fresh growler, pours a fairly bright orange. Definitely hazy, but not opaque. Nice 2 fingers of foam leave decent lacing. "
From 04/07/16 notes. 13 oz. pour for $8 in a snifter at Gingerman in NYC.
"On tap at Gingerman, 10oz snifter."
Can dated 3/8/16
16 ounce tallboy into an oversized tulip. 
"summer 2016 release, poured from can into tulip"
"Pours a pale gold, very bright but quite hazy. 1 finger eggshell head. Good lacing and a thin layer of foam remains once it recedes."
Canned 3-8-16 (batch 2)
From can. Vibrant orange with a thin head. Retention a bit lacking. Decent spattered lacing. Nose is a citrus burst. Super fresh. Taste is super juicy. Starburst that tastes like actual fruit a bite of hop. Super smooth. Resiny stick. Only thing holding this back is the carb is a tad light. Impressed with this beer.
Too sweet
Cloudy gold with a finger of white foam. A swirl leaves lace aplenty. The head kicks back to a finely knit cap and thick ring.
L: Soft slightly hazy golden and light yellow hues with a thin white head
"This beer pours a cloudy golden orange reminiscent of orange juice. The head is one finger and bright white. The retention is solid and there are plenty of thin hanging sheets of lacing. Smell is a bit more subdued than other Grimm offerings, but still awesome. Grapefruit, mango, orange, pineapple and some pithy citrus all blend together to form a very complex aroma. Taste is similar with a solid amount of bitterness that seems to lessen as the beer warms (still a good deal more bitter than any Grimm IPA other than Pulse Wave). The tropical and citrus fruit is there, but not as prevalent as in the smell because the bitterness seems to stymie them a bit. There is also just a subtle hint of honey-like malt sweetness. Feel is medium with the bitterness tickling the tongue on the finish. Not nearly as soft and juicy as most of their offerings. Also a bit under carbonated. Overall an excellent beer, but definitely a level below the world class standards Grimm has set with their other hoppy offerings."
16oz can from Beershop NYC on the UWS
"Canned Mar. 8, 2017, enjoyed Mar. 21, 2016."
"A: Orange gatorade thing going on. Opaque. Off white, tight one finger head in my teku that leaves some sticky lacing. Some sitting bubbles at the base of"
"Had a glass at Astoria Bier & Cheese (Broadway). Huge perfumey aroma of rich tropical fruits. These carry to the flavor with tangerine and mango, and a dry citrus punch finish. Medium bodied and bitter. You could slow down and sip if you like, but no so thick that you have to take your time. Great, bold hit of juicy hops."
"From the can, pours hazy bright orange gold color with a perfect looking 2 finger whipped/foamy white head that was full of bubbles of all sizes, dissipating very slowly and leaving great spider webs of lacing and rings as it went down. As Lord Vader would say, ""Impressive, most impressive."""
"The lazy description would be a less sweet, less 'juicy' Julius. A more hoppy, less malty Jai Alai. But it really shouldn't be reduced to that..."
"Review of the second batch. This is just as good as I remember the first batch being, and strikes a great balance between Lambo Door and Tesseract. Look is a nice hazy yellow-orange, but not incredibly turbid. Smell smacks you right in the face when you crack the can - mango, white grape, melon, and a bit of pine on the finish. Taste follows - incredible juicy flavor with just the right amount of bitter on the finish. This is incredibly drinkable for a DIPA, I finished the 16oz can much faster than intended. Soft mouthfeel, similar to other Grimm IPAs, perhaps a little under-carbed. Overall, this is phenomenal and possibly even edges out Tesseract for me."
"Split a can with the lady and simply put this brew delivers on all promises. It has a clean and unobtrusive malt base that lets the tropical(mango, papaya, guava) shine. Slightly below optimal carbonation, but this does not hamper the flavor. A bit hazy yellow orange color with a bit of lacing. Enjoy and hope to try again."
Look is hazy golden with yellow highlights. 
On Draft at The Lower Depths in Boston
"Friend of mine that lives in Manhattan was able to grab me 1 can, which I poured into an IPA glass."
"On tap at Sea Witch (Brooklyn,NY)"
Poured a hazy yellowish hue with a one finger head. Smell is of tropical grapefruit. Taste is mango and pineapple followed by grapefruit. Nice balance of tropical notes and bitterness. A wonderfully balanced beer. Hope to have this again.
"Hazy orange color with minimal/quick fading head. The nose is is sweet citrusy with just a hint of hops. The taste, while still sweet, is much more smooth hops with a lingering bitterness. The finish is a persistent mellow bitterness. The fell overall is quite juicy and enjoyable when not masked by the bitterness. A very good IPA."
Served in a snifter at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. 
"Grabbed a bunch of these sort of randomly having never heard of Grimm prior to this first canning. Man did I luck out. This is an absolutely awesome beer, the best DIPA I have have tasted in a while."
Served in a tulip glass at Buddha Bar. From notes. Reviewed 7 October 2015.
Over rated
this pours out like a orange hazy looking juice. smells very good.. the mouthfeel is not as thick as I prefer but still good. Flavor is tropical juices with little bitterness. very very good beer
Had this on draft at Whole Foods in Brooklyn. 
"Poured into a snifter from the can with is dated 9/14/15. Pours a bright but hazy orange, slight peach color. White bubbles but no head."
"This was one of the better IPA'S I have had in a long while! I don't know if it was just different or was actually that good, but it was a true juice bomb! Lots of flavor up front with a smoother then ever finish on the back end. If you think Julius is crushable, then you gotta try this!"
Had on tap at Beltway Brewing.
Decent beer . Didnt LOVE it but it has great traits . The hops came off alittle sweet . I dig the can art
Beautiful amber orange color with about a finger of white head. Moderate lacing left on the glass. Tropical fruit is heavy in the nose as well as melon and bubblegum. Taste is slightly more on the malt side yet still very well balanced. Very impressed by the latest Grimm offering!
"Hazy orange, white head. Mostly tropical fruit on the nose which followed on the pallet. Extremely drinkable, without even trying I drank the pint in 5 minutes. I was only able to get one can from a local bottle shop but hopefully can get more in the near future. I drank my first Zombie Dust the next night which didn't compare to how awesome AfterImage. Look out for Grimm, they're poised to make some major noise in the beer world soon."
"This beer was served on tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, New York. It arrived in a house snifter showing off a ruddy auburn, toasted apricot coloring. It held a creamy, wispy one finger head of solid heady bubbling. This retained well before disappearing into outlines of mountains around our glasses. Definite haze obscured clarity, and the beer just had this salty look about it. No sediment was noted. Carbonation appeared to be lighter. The aroma was where things really starting getting crazy. This has got to be the fruitiest, most intensely juicy and melony hoppy explosion we’ve ever encountered. Hoppy aromatics were melon, poppy citrics, and sweet grassy varietals, while the remainder of the nose’s receptors were flooded with clean and lightly toasted pale grain, soft white wheatiness, raw barley, green strawberry tops, pear juice and macerated flesh, the freshest lemon and orange juiciness, dusty pollen, candied cashews, cotton candy cloy but without the esterness, big mineral twangs, sweet ethanol, green grassy resins, and Kool Aid sugars. With warmth came rum, sweet tea, and so, so, so much honey sweetness. The flavoring translates with insane, mechanical accuracy into a flowery sashay of skinned cucumber, spicy, zesty, juicy, and incredibly poppy citric, tropical nectary, and floral hops, white chalk, cantaloupe and watermelon rind, graphite, heavy lemon peel and seed, dripping wet washed peaches and passion fruit, simmered holiday cranberries, and pale and clean light amber graininess. The aftertaste gave exaggerated notes of bittered citric peel hoppiness and massive waves of clean vanilla fruitiness. The body was a solid, full medium, and the carbonation was high and electric. Each sip gave silky slurp and smack off the rip, with a lighter creaminess or frothiness. Pop was rolled into the carbonation, and nearly indistinguishable on its own. The mouth is coated in the softest snow of bubbliness, leading you to the lightest touch of a dry, crispy, hoppy finish. The abv is appropriate, and all but undetectable, and the beer drinks absolutely phenomenally. The problem is that you want to savor it because this might be your only glass ever."
For me there's Heady and then this. That should be explanation enough. Outstanding!
"This beer made me wanna write my first review. Pours out of the can a beautiful hazy orange. The aroma is dominated by sweet tropical fruits. The taste follows the nose, orange,pineapple, cantaloupe, passion fruit, peach, and a bit of bready sweetness. Really drinkable, like juice. I have to say this is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Reminiscent of Lambo Doors. Definitely worth your while."
"On draft, NYC, 37F, 12 ounce fluted tulip snifter."
"From a can dated 8 days prior to drinking. Got caught up in the hype of just being able to obtain a can so expectations were very high, especially after Grimm placing two beers in the Dbl IPA contest. Tasted direct from can and then from glass. It pours a nice hazy orange. It smells like hops but with no real distinction of what hops might be. I didn't get the fruitiness that others did. Certainly not like Treehouse Haze or Sip of Sunshine. It did not feel like a double, more like a 6% beer. Overall very good but not the equal of some other Northeast IPAs out there."
"Pours murky, almost opaque. Deep orange color with medium off-white head, which dropped kind of quickly. But that's the closest I can find for flaws in this dipa. Insane fruity hop aroma with passion fruit, grapefruit and guava up front. Flavor is similar fruity/ tropical hops with a dank spice in the background. Malt is very light and lands way behind the hops. Mouthfeel is just incredible. Soft, dry on the finish, seems insanely light for the ABV. Props."
"Lots of stone fruit and citrus, but a remarkably mellow mouthful. No harsh IPA bite at all. You feel the 8% halfway through the can (poured into a glass of course) but man does it tempt you to have another one. Wish it wasn't so rare, but maybe I won't be saying that once Grimm (hopefully) gets settled over the next couple years and doesn't have to go ""gypsy"" like they've been."
cans hit town today and we're tricky to get ahold of but managed to snag a pair. enjoyed from a Grimm sherry taster. 
Astounding DIPA.
"Pours a murky honey straw yellow. Smell is absolutely juicy peach and mango. The taste follows, with passion fruit, peach, sweet mango prolonged through the middle, maybe guava, and a slight bready and wheaty touch before a hint of pine hits and a lingering slight bitterness. Very well made. Would like a bit more bitterness but for what they were going for, this is spot on."
Purchased a growler of this from Vista Beer and Beverage in NY.
"Pours orange with a light haze, very thin head. Very tropical with peach, mango, and apricot on both the nose and palate. Ends with moderate hop bitterness as well as a medium sweetness. Nice viscous mouthfeel, proably middle of the road for a DIPA. I took a bit off because I thought it was undercarbonated from can (not so on tap at Gingerman.)"
Perfect double IPA I could drink these all day nice dank tropical fruity beer. The smell was the same as how it tasted. I'd suggest this to anyone I don't think I've had a better IPA
"Opaque golden body with a couple of fat fingers of white head. Pale orchard and tropical fruit suggested by the body, bursting with citrusy and floral hops; plush and juicy, vibrant and soft... A real stunner out of the can from Grimm, double dry hopped, featuring Mosaic, El Dorado, Falconer's Flight, Columbus, and Simcoe hops..."
"L - slightly hazy, medium orange"
"Had this on tap, but now it's time for a formal review. 16 oz. can into a tulip."
"The beer comes in a rich intense hazy orange color, straight nectarine juice."
"This one lived up to the hype. Fantastic smell, as good as a beer can smell. Excellent taste, finishes dry to me which is what I like in my DIPAs. This one right up there with the best DIPAs out there."
"From a can dated 9/14/15. Golden pour with a thick and pure white head. Aroma is incredible, sweet malts and sweeter fruits. Taste is amazing; a super pineapple bomb. Ridiculously delicious."
"Growler fill at Nathaniel Square Corner Store in Rochester, NY."
"Canned about a week ago. Cloudy peach color with a thick white head, good bit of lacing. The smell is piney with notes of overripe banana way down there, a touch of alcohol too. Taste starts off sweet and spicy, moves into robust fruit juice flavors, then finishes with a raw bitterness and a little burn. It's thick, not too bubbly, slick in the finish. Another solid beer from Grimm."
"Editing for the newest batch December 3, 2017:"
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Blue Session. Really pale, hazy look. Aroma has milky yeast, dextrin malt or vanilla, lactose and grassy hops. Taste is sweet, milky and hoppy with a light astringent hop bitterness on the finish."
"Good, but disappointing. Consumed day of. Only tried 1 can, so maybe results vary depending on the can from same batch, which has happened more than I'd like from Tired Hands with other 4-packs in the past. No notes of vanilla, no matter how hard I tried to think."
Hazy uniltered dark yellow color with a thick two fingered off-white head
"Canned on 11/30/17, ‘Yo Bro’. "
"My first milkshake. Not much on the nose except some mild vanilla but has the look and feel that I really enjoy in an IPA. The vanilla taste is subtle but anymore would be too overwhelming. Finishes with a citrus taste, more orange than anything. Excellent beer."
Pours orange with big white head. Aroma of vanilla and light earthy tones. Taste is excellent! Reminds me of a vanilla milkshake no pun intended. Light tropical fruit finish. This bad boy actually get a lot better as it warms. Very well crafted and balanced. Big fan of milkshake series.
"pours out a hazed golden orange color with bright white head that leaves nice lacing. mostly tropical and citrus on the nose - mellow pineapple, grapefruit, getting a sweet bready note as well. on palate is more this immensely bready note, with a creamy and sugary characteristic as well. creamy vanilla, and some subtle berry notes and hints of tropical fruits, pina coloda esque in a way lol. cant really even begin to describe this one, very interesting though. not necessarily my favorite IPA but rating it high for being unique and excellent. mouthfeel is on point as well."

Poured from a can into a tasting glass.
"Very solid and unique dipa here! The vanilla really shines in the front then the hops take over mid way and a nice bite in the back! I love the way these guys put twists on the NE style IPAs, I will always seek out Tired Hands. Cheers."
Can Date: 3/30/17
"Pours a dull orange with a murky clarity. Nose expresses mango and vanilla. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of an earthy character. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a creamy texture. I haven't had too many milkshake IPAs - that said, this one was quite tasty."
"Deep golden and hazy to the point of opaque, tall white head and nice lacing. Fruity and creamy aroma. Notes of soft tangerine, mango, pineapple and vanilla creamer. Medium body but thick and substantial feel, very creamy, a touch drying on a soft finish with subdued bitterness. It comes off as a killer IPA first and foremost but it has a pleasant albeit subtle vanilla cream aspect that plays lovely with the fruity hop profile."
"Fantastic brew---have had many of the milkshakes and though I love the fruited versions, this one is excellent.... Creamier and smoother than the EXTRA vanilla, with an extra shot of breyers vanilla ice cream.... A great hoppy beer with a dessert quality to it...well-done!"
Poured into a tulip. Just released a week ago.
L - Haze for days!
My first Tired Hands Shake. Nose is orange creamciclr. Taste is pretty much as advertised-little tropical IPA that quickly becomes vanilla and cream. Little bitter hoppy kick at the end. Super smooth. Different - very fun. Now I see what all the noise is about.
From draft at TH. From the tap list: DIPA. 9.2% Brewed with heavy amounts of luscious malted oats and lactose sugar. Conditioned atop twice the amount of pungent Madagascar beans. Intensely hopped and dry-hopped with Mosaic and Citra.
"Enjoying a pint can less than a month old. Pours murky, light orange, with a half-finger of head. Lots of tropical fruit, but with an emphasis on more honeyed, melon-like flavors as opposed to citrus notes. Good injection of pine and blueberry from the Mosaic. That and the Azacca in the dry-hop dominate for my palate, beating out the citra and Simcoe. That said, this is a hop battle of the highest order, that ends up being nicely balanced and not at all overwhelming. This could just as easily be 7% instead of the 9.3% ABV indicated on the can."
"Canned 10.1.18, opened 11.5.18"
"4.5 across the board. A really nice representation. Pours a murky deep orange with a slight off white head. Nose is fruity. Aromas of tropical fruits and stone fruit. Taste is a beautiful thing. Sweet pineapple, lemon zest, ripe melon and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Enough doughy malt to break up the fruitiness. Medium to full body slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel. Hoppy non bitter finish. I dig it!"
Appearance is a very murky dark orange and poured with a finger plus of spongelike off white head. 
Thanks to superspak for this Michigan beauty.
Appearance - Pours completely opaque turbid yellow color with a huge soapy white head that leaves lost of sticky lacing all around the glass.
Fresh can poured into fluted snifter.
"Intersting beer; slight funk to nosw. Juciness on front of palate, changes to slight bitterness -- gently lingers-- balanced and different. 4/27/18"
"You know that point in the cartoon where the guy sees the girl, and his eyes turn into hearts and his mouth hits the floor? Forget Ana de Paula, forget Barbara Palvin, and forget Sarah Sampaio; and the moment, this is the only thing Raul adores. I mean, can I? Can I even describe this hazed out beauty? The thang glows a gentle tropical haze like Paul McCartney’s brainwaves during his first acid trip. Aroma should be damn near illegal. I popped the can and it exploded like a tropical grenade. Boom! Taste is more radical than Lennon leading a revolution. I mean, this thing blows up with hops and equator fruits like Magellan getting lost in The Bermuda Triangle."
"If you love M-43, this beer is for you! It's even better than M-43"
"This beer makes you smile. Period. It's a smile that comes from ""holy f, how did they do that? "" so smooth. Magnificent balance of flavor, bitter, and sweet. Lacing on the glass reads like a yearbook signing, ""great times this year, looking forward to summer. KIT."""
From tasting notes 03/02/18
"Pours a murky citrus punch color with a half finger white head that is gone in a flash,a somewhat menacing look.Tropical fruits and fresh cut grass jump out in the nose,a little sweet onion is there as well,no sharpness or much of a malty presence.Juicy and sweet like candy on the palate,grilled pineapple and mango with a bit of grapefruit rind presence in the back end.A think low carbonated feel makes it go down easy as well.Worthy of it's rating not a run of the mill NE style IPA."
"It looks like murky river water with light brown to dark copper and an exceptionally hazy complexion that let's minimal light through. There's a quarter inch of off white on top. It smells like orange juice with hints of pineapple. I'm tasting citrus, pineapple, mango, and pear. The mouth is smooth and it finishes bitter."
"16oz can packaged on 04/13/18. Pours an opaque burnt orange color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of juicy fruits. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, guava, strawberry and orange. Some dank hops as well. The taste is more of the same fruits but dank and piney hops show up more this time. Ripe pineapple, grapefruit, orange, guava, mango, passionfruit and strawberry. Ripe fruit finish with some lightly toasted malts and dank hops. Creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation and a slightly dry mouthfeel. Moderate alcohol heat. Fantastic Imperial IPA that I’m glad I got a chance to try."
"Colossally colloidal. Pale no-pulp orange juice. Respectable finger of white head that is more frothy than soapy, furthering the illusion that this is just an orange juice spritzer."
this beer pours a murky pale orange juice color with a thick off-white head. 
16oz can dated 3/2x/18 poured into a tulip
"Total juice appearance, like a mix of pale grapefruit and low-pulp OJ. Pale orange and extremely turbid, with a soft and foamy off-white head that settles quickly but stays frothy through each sip. Little bit of sticky lacing, but not much."
"Big hazy yellow with big head in a tulip glass. Warm 70 degree michigan weather (the first this season). Fantastically smooth with a big body, the wheat and hops come through to form a delicious orange blast. Congrats. You've had 4 and are now hammered because they were so good you drank them super fast."
"Tasted in a Rastal Teku from a one pint can on April 19, 2018."
A Hophead's Dream
Poured a turbid yellow orange with a good thick white head.
Pours super hazy. Murky Tropicana . 
"Amazing nose, great taste. Still prefer the M-43."
Poured from 16 oz can dated 3/13/2018
"From Labirratorium. Watching Logan. Full of juicy fruits with alcohol really well hidden. Superb aroma. Taste good too but not enough to deserve its cost (10.50€) Canned 12 Feb. As the end approach, the bitterness becomes pretty strong, which helps in avoiding the fruityness to become excessive. Ultralong aftertaste , during even after the next morning"
Canned 2/14/18. 
"Completely opaque and turbid brew. Head production is solid, and retention and lacing are good."
Oh my!!!!!!!!!
Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 1/26/18
Thank you CanConPhilly for this
"Rating #1500, and what a beer to do it with! From the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass."
First one from old Nation Brewing. I really love it. Pours like orange juice. Nice white head with nice lacing.pillowy mouth feel. Lots of flavor from start to finish.
"One of the best NEIPA's ive had, up there with the Bissell Bros and Tree House hazies. "
16 FL. OZ. can
Can share pour. Thanks 'Vidblain'.
"I picked up an M-43 while I was driving around Michigan last year and was tremendously impressed - people I'd talked to on forums had told me that it varied quite a lot from batch to batch, but I must have got a good one. I'd been looking forward to Boss Tweed for a while."
Canned 1/13/2018 Consumed 2/10/2018.
"Can 2018, revised review"
Very disappointing beer after all the hype. Tree house and Trillium or even Odd Side Ales do the NE style better. 
Pour: deep golden color. No light gets through. Plenty of hazy sediment. Decent 2 finger head that leaves very slight lacing. 
"Pours a murky orange-yellow color with a huge, froth head."
Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip
"Pours hazy orange. Thick, medium, foamy white head that Fades slowly with light lacing."
Wow.
16oz can from IAmJacksHopTongue (thanks for the hoppy care package!). Canned 9/11/17. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. Enjoyed 9/27/17. 
"Thanks to FlintB for this16 oz. can, pulled out to celebrate a miraculous first-round Vikings win over the hated Saints. Woooohooo! "
Brief Review:
A pint can dated 12/21/17 poured in a 12oz. tulip glass.
I like M-43 better.
"16oz can. Packaged 12/07/17. Dark thick orange color with light brown head. Drank from a tulip glass. Simcoe and citra hops immediately on the nose and pallet. Very drinkable, sweet, no bitterness. Great balance."
"The pour is a milkshake thick grapefruit color, and as an earlier review states, there’s a greenish hue to this that looks a bit strange, all about Nader a fluffy off-white head. "
Canned 11/17/17
Flawless Victory
16oz can poured into a tulip
"16oz can, purchased fresh at the brewery, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 07.09.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Some interesting fruit notes in this rather bruising DIPA, whose alcoholic warmth comes through perceptibly. Guava perhaps? Pineapple, especially the the slightly astringent note that comes with a bit of rind. A bit of green onion. Maybe some bubble gum? It's an interesting mix of notes, and has some allure, though more as novelty than repeat play. Standard carb, not especially soft and light but not overly spritzy either. A fine DIPA but nothing memorable."
"This one pours a very hazy light orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Old Nation is going to brighten up this part one way or another. If it's not the radiant, succulent and refreshing taste, then its certainly the imperial alcohol strength that with brighten the mood. But make no mistake about it- Their Boss Tweed is the star of this show."
"To my taste, this and M43 are very sweet. I recall liking M43 more but the latest batch also had a lingering sweetness. Now, not all sweetness is bad ... but this felt like sugary simple syrup sweetness and imparted a silken and tad heavy texture."
"Tasted blind, 7/20 can poured into Teku glass."
On tap at the brewery.
"Poured into a 16 oz Sam Adams perfect pint glass, canned on 7/10/17 I believe or 7/13 and consumed on 8/11. Pours a very murky, like pineapple/ orange juice and leaves a solid inch plus of sticky off white head that coats the sides of the glass with walls of lace."
"Hard to mark this down for anything, but if there is one thing that gets me is the lack of carbonation. Its fine for the first half, but really dies by the end of the glass."
"The aroma filled the room as soon as i popped the top, huge aroma, a hop heads dream! Pours a hazy orange with a thick creamy head that coats the glass nicely. Taste of tropical fruits, mango pineappale, tangerines, a nice bit of bitterness on the back end to set it apart from the smooth NEIPAs, this is an outstanding brew worth seeking out."
"Opaque honey-orange with a dense, uniform white foam."
16 oz. can dated 6/23/17
"16 oz can. Cloudy deep orange pour with thick white head that lasts and coats the glass. Tropical citrusy aroma. Big explosive juicy flavors. Citrus, mango, papaya with grapefruit peeking out at the end. Slightly on the sweet side with the high abv but well balanced. One of the softest feeling IPAs I've had. This bad boy is dangerous."
Canned 6/23/17; drank 7/9/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 6/23/2017. Pours very hazy golden orange/amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, orange juice, peach, apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, grapefruit, guava, lemon, citrus zest, berry, light pepper/pine, wheat, white bread dough, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with amazing complexity and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus hops and moderate bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, orange juice, peach, apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, grapefruit, guava, lemon, citrus zest, berry, light pepper/pine, wheat, white bread dough, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very minimal pine, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, orange juice, peach, apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, grapefruit, guava, lemon, citrus zest, berry, light pepper/pine, wheat, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is incredible. Minimal warming alcohol for 9.3%. Overall this is an insane NEIPA! All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/tropical/citrus hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the ABV, with the very mildly bitter/drying finish. Pure citrus/tropical fruit juice hop flavors, with a touch of dankness; perfectly balanced malts, without feeling overly sweet or heavy for the ABV. A highly amazing offering, and world class style example. One of the best I have had yet."
"Amepped up version of little bro M-43, hazy juicy citrus bomb really special NEIPA that's in my backyard"
"Opaque slightly dirty orange body, off white fluffy sticky head, huge juice nose, and even bigger flavor, pith is there but mostly juice. Feel is full, coating. Delicious."
A week old can poured into teku glass.
Smell: citrus and tropical fruits. Orange mango passionfruit lemon. Some herbaceousness. A deep berry note. Floral hops some sweet bready doughy malt as well.
"We made the trip to the brewery just for it, wasn't sold on it there but once I settled in and polished off the growler my mind was changed for the better. Will savour the last two cans with friends."
Every bit as good as Tree House or Trillium. Dangerously easy to drink
"Old Nation's best work yet. This NE DIPA has all the qualities you would expect from Trillium, Bissell, Other Half, etc; citrus punch, pillowy mouthfeel and a pleasant hop bitterness on the backend."
"I don't know or do all of the technical terms but this stuff is dynamite coming from Old Nation. I have yet to seek out or try the heralded breweries in the NE (treehouse, other half, trillium, etc) and I don't think I need or want to anymore. If you like their M-43 or Boxer, this trumps both of those. The haze is there, the tropical fruits are there, it is an awesome beer."
A - Pours a turbid golden orange with a one finger creamy white head. The head dissapates quickly leaving some nice sticky lacing.
Pours a hazy gold with a bubbly one finger head atop the snifter. Head dissipates after a few sips. Smell is bright citrus zest with a creamy sweet tang that tickles the nose. Taste is sweet candies tangerine and grapefruit zest. Sweet citrus bomb with minimal of any bitter. Texture is smooth and creamy. Creamsicle DIPA. Well done.
On draft into a tulip glass at release.
Serving: Can
"Appearance: Pours with a nice bubble show that settles in at two fingers capping the murky, honey colored liquid; sudsy lacing"
"Look - Most memorable part of this beer for me. Dense head, heavy lacing, extremely hazy/opaque appearance"
Best practice typical DIPA
Can Date: none
"Pours a turbid yellow slightly tinged with orange. Moderate to small amount of head retention and lacing. Aroma and flavor are of pineapple and orange creamsicle with hints of grapefruit, mango and peach. At 9.4% abv the alcohol is present but nicely subdued. I'm glad I didn't give up on Aslin IPAs after the first 5-6 I had were underwhelming because the last few I've had have been stellar."
Tall can w/o canning date info

16oz can poured into a snifter
"Mind The Hop, after a vigorous pour, is a slightly white washed, opaque orange. It's creamy, frothy scoop of a head sticks around to coat blanket the liquid below as well as to the sides of the glass. And it sticks well!"
"Poured into a snifter. Hazy and turbid, golden in color with a creamy off white head. Big aroma that I noticed on the pour: a nice mix of grapefruit, tropical fruit, and piney earth. I got more of the earthy notes on the palate with dank resin. The fruit notes were there and melded well. Moderately bitter in the NE ""soft"" way and a superb soft feel for such a big beer. Slightly warming on the finish. Fantastic."
"L - Orangish-amber color and totally hazy with a short, white head that leaves tons of lacing."
"L - Murky, dirty orange"
this has been in my fridge for a minute so i didn't give it the best reviews because it wasn't great by any means. I'll revist when i have it fresh!
"Poured from a 16oz can into Tulips, split with Emily. Thank you Ryan for hooking me up with this long awaited want!"
Can stamped 07/05/17
"Double IPA with only Citra hops... obviously smells super tropical and the flavor is refreshing. This definitely didn't have anything that stood out. It's a solid rendition but wouldn't go out of my way for it,"
"Canned 5/03/17, consumed 5/17/17"
Wow! Hazy gold color and a dank fruity nose. On the taste it has explosive fruit flavor balanced nicely by malt and a bitter hop finish. Plenty of effervesce and a long pleasant finish. These guys can definitely hang with the big New England players.
Super soft mouthfeel. Taste is a touch fumy and some bitter in the finish. Decent but not top notch.
Poured from can. Amber in color with loads of sediment. Smell is faint and citrusy. Bitter and resiny taste but doesn't linger. For 9.4% that's crisp. Love the resinous hoppiness.
"In comparison to the Lasor Raptor, this has less flavor and more hop. Nice look, decent feel, but didn't quite hit the mark."
"I've been 3 for 3 with Aslin beers so far, let's see what Mind the Hop has in store."
"Another Aslin winner. Not as hazy as I thought it'd be. More of a dark orange. Aroma is melons, little citrus, maybe slight bubble gum? Taste is melon, subtle bubble gum with a touch of hop bitterness. Mouth is avg for a DIPA. Not chewy but not thin. Good carb. Overall, a great DIPA from Aslin. These guys do hops right!"
"Another great beer from Aslin. Mind the Hop is a solid DIPA. It's very drinkable given the heavy 9.5% ABV. As usual from Aslin, a burst of citrus and surprisingly sweet and somewhat acidic. Tastes of mangoes and peaches. Loaded with hops and noticeably dry. Unfiltered as usual from the brewer. I cant' recall seeing a cloudier IPA in my life. Very little head or lacing. Currently, my favorite from this brewer."
"Piney, weedy, lemony smell. Taste is sweet fruits, dank, and rind bitterness. Some sweet resin. No sense of the alcohol content. Fizzy and full of flavor, dissipates to a clean water taste at the very end."
"This may be my favorite Aslin beer so far next Johann the Mango Thief. Mind the Hop is impossible not to like. Murky orange color, pineapple passionfruit apricot nose and taste, sticky head, and fluffy mouthfeel. Awesome balanced IPA without having to be extreme."
Fresh can drank on 2/24/17
This is my second review but far from my second experience with Aslin. This is a top 3 release and again one of the best beers I've ever had. I wait in line every Thursday for cans - sometimes successful sometimes not .... but always worth the wait. Very fortunate to live close by these folks. Keep up the great work.
"Overall I'd say Double Orange Starfish is the only one (from what I've had) that can give this brew a run for its money. Super tasty, and like most Aslin beers, just beautiful in the glass."
As far as IPAs go this is absolutely top notch! Had a good friend bring this back from Aslin to share with me and it was a thick & juicy hop bomb! Amazing stuff coming from these guys!
Have tried a bunch of the variants but this is the first time I was able to snag a crowler. October 27 date and poured into tulip glass.
"32 oz crowler. Pours deep opaque apricot orange, thin white head fades to a thin ring, tons of lacing. Orange and ripe mango aroma, plum. Juicy sweet taste, citrus pulp, peach n plum. Dank weedy hops linger but don't take over until the very end. Finishes dry with weedy herbal notes ant that citrus still there. So good. Is this brew really over 9%? So dangerous."
"L: Somewhat darker than other Aslin hoppy brews, but still retains that hazy and cloudy look we all love; healthy white foam head and ample lacing"
"This is another great hoppy Aslin offering, only second to Master of Karate. Massive Citra flavor profile and all the turbid juiciness you could want in an au currant IPA."
Mind the hop has been the staple of their IPA list since its first release. This seems to be what all the others are stemmed from. It's got a good flavor and the feel is quite nice. Definitely a daily beer in the summer of ever there was one.
"Excellent smooth and juicy finish, masks the alcohol exceptionally well. Cloudy, decent head, poured from the tap, This beer has been getting better and better each batch."
"Even when these guys 'make mistakes', they can do no wrong. This is from a crowler from the release today (5/28/16). Eventually I heard they stopped filling crowlers because the batch was slightly undercarbed. This was probably in anticipation of these crowlers making their way around the country (and being consumed 3-10 days after filled). This anticipation is correct and legit. This beer is amazing."
"March 2018: Hazy gold color, little head retention. Pretty lifeless. Nose is the characteristic Aslin blend dominated by tropical fruit and backed up by pine. This is mango, pineapple, orange rind, and a touch of lemon. Flavor is smoother than the MoK I just had, but also less punchy. Taste is mango up front with lemon and orange in the middle and finishing with a brighter pineapple and some lingering orange-y pine. I think this is much better on it's own than with fruit and vanilla. Feel is big and chewy but not quite as sweet and slightly overbearing as MoK. Really nailed it. This is definitely a couple steps up from some of the cans I had last year. Seek this out (and I typically don't enjoy 8.5+% IPAs..). (4.47)"
"Probably my favorite beer from these guys, which is tough because they make so many great IPAs. This one is slightly different than alot of their offerings, much more balanced and closely resembles other DIPAs in look and mouthfeel. Alot of their IPA's are SUPER hazy, almost milky....which is certainly not a bad thing at all. This to me is a more complete beer than others. Huge aroma of orange zest, grapefruit. This drinks SO EASY its scary. Great hop profile that works in unison with the citrus notes, although this is a juice bomb for sure. If you are in the area, try to grab this. Really impressive for such a young brewery"
"This beer will get you in trouble, holy balls. This beer doesnt taste like its packing 9.4% in it. Alcohol is completely hidden behind the flavor profile of this beer. This looks like orange juice, the color is amazing. Nose is great tropical fruit, grapefruit, papaya, pineapple. Mouthfeel is incredible, such a smooth and drinkable beer for how much booze it hides."
Crowler from two days ago (also had on tap at brewery):
"Another juice bomb! On tap, poured into a snifter. A great orange haze color. The aroma was subtle. Great taste that had a nice juicy kick with a hint of hop."
From the tap at the brewery. Visit - great dudes and great beer.
"Very good. So drinkable. It's insane that Mind The Hop is 9+% abv. A must try if you like New England style IPA's and worthy to be in the same discussion as Treehouse brews, IMHO."
"Nice golden orange color. Aroma full of citrus, pineapple, and other tropical fruits. Nice upfront candied citrus followed by a rounded off bitter finish. Overall mouthfeel was nearly perfect for the style. Drank very smooth for 9.4%"
"Insanely hazy with a wonderful tropical fruit nose. The flavor didn't quite live up to the aroma, but it was still pretty impressive, just a little on the sweet side. Incredibly easy to drink for 9.4%. It wasn't perfectly executed, but this is still one of the better hoppy beers from the DC area."
Fruity goodness that goes down smooth. Definitely worth a 5.
"On tap at the Brewery. Pours a very murky hazy golden hue, mild head, lots of lacing. Smells fantastic, fruit and hops. Taste is nice, lots of citrus and pine. Easy drinking."
"From a growler, pours nearly opaque with a half-finger white head that dissipates to a film. I don't remember ever seeing apricot juice, but this is how I imagine it would look. Smell is bursting with sweet fruits--orange, tangerine, mango, peach, pineapple, like some mad experiment combined all of them into a monstrous hybrid citrus/tropical superfruit. Also layers of pine, savory dankness and hints of mint or eucalyptus. Complex and gorgeous. "
"A medium gold appearance with orange and light brown notes. Opaque like nothing else. If I didn't know this was a New England style, I would have knocked it."
"An absolutely crazy juice bomb made from the tears of whales only in the month of July off the coast of Spain. Pineapple, papaya and guava intermingle with a delicate hop dankness that cascades to tropical fruit balanced with a pungent hop bitterness that mellows with a little help from the luxuriously pillowy mouthfeel."
Wow. My first experience with Aslin and their hazy Northeast style IPAs. You will not be disappointed. 
Pour from a 32 oz growler filled yesterday at Aslin. 
"Pours a bright orange with thin lacy head. Aroma of tangerine, pineapple, mango, and other tropical fruits. Flavor is juicy upfront with a nice lingering bitter finish. Overall this is a great go-to DIPA, mouthfeel is full, and hard to believe it is 9.4%!!"
"This beer is total citrus juicy brilliance. Aslin is making wonderful beers and they will big on the map for NoVA and (hopefully) nationally in the upcoming years. This beer rivals the best of the best citra based double IPAs you've had. It smells of dank citrus flavors with a dank almost Weed like smell at the finish. Unfortunately it's color is a bit off and fuzzy dark orange with a bit of brown, but I was promised by the guys they're working to fix that (edit: they fixed that. Total orange juice bomb). This tastes better than the world class and acclaimed citra DIPAs you've had. Finish is so smooth that you don't get any malty back, but you get a smooth like feeling that your swallowing a citrus fruit. Wonderful beer. I cannot wait until more people get to try this and have their minds blown."
"Pours a hazy orange with a one inch fluffy white head that lacing down the entire glass. Smells of citrus fruits, melon and pine. Tastes of grapefruit, cantaloupe, apricot, mango, pine and a hint of grass. Medium bodied and carbonated, creamy mouth feel, mild bitterness."
"Like Alain Delon in Le Samurai, this dang thing is smooth! Very dry and pithy. Kind of lacks in the after taste like a Stormy Daniels quickie. Good nonetheless."
A draft pour at Burial Brewing Asheville.
Honestly one of the best NEIPAs I've had. The Mosaic hope is truly the smoothest and creamiest hop for sweet delicious beer. I have maybe 30 different OtherHalf beers and this is there best one. I probably even think it's better than the DDH version.
16oz. can into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303
"such a delicious beer profiling maybe the most delicious hop variety. the ddh version of this is also quite spectacular, but i may prefer this one without the extra hop assault. mouthfeel is creamier/thicker in this most recent batch (canned 5/19/17 ""juice bomb"") than what i remember from previous batches."
"Mosaic hops are a hybrid of Nugget and Simcoe, so it should surprise no one that there is a wide array of fruity notes both in the nose and on the palate. Deliciously chewy, this DIPA might certainly qualify as sessionable at 8.5% in hophead circles, and I'd concur. Hazy and thick, but rich in flavor and extremely satisfying. Would pair well with a host of foods and it shines by its lonesome. If you drink it in the right glass (meaning NOT a shaker glass, but a true IPA glass) you're in for a treat, as olfaction and retro-olfaction are enhanced in every sip. Double Mosaic is indeed a Dream."

"Hazy murky deep golden, big white head and great lacing. Huge citrus aromas. Notes of sugar coated grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple and orange pulp. Medium body, coats the pallet and leaves a nice linger and dry finish. Seriously amazing, so good I almost forgot to write this review."
Poured into a 13 oz Lost Abbey long stim tulip glass canned on 2/3/17. Pours a very murky yellow orange with a two inch sticky white head that leaves behind plenty of lace.
"Good lord, all these guys do is pump out outstanding NE-style IPAs and DIPAs... As usual, grapefruit juice colored ale with a coupla fingers of white foam and some lace sheeting trailing behind. This has something of a lemony grapefruit sweetart bite, maybe something like dank lime around the edges - a nice tropical/citrus character - the bitterness is sharp but not crushing, and the sweetness is clean, tingly, and bright. Relatively crisp and tart, medium-light feel but ample. 2/3/17 canning. Not to be passed up..."
"Great double IPA, typical NE low bitterness and loads of tropical fruit flavor from the mosaic. Light golden body all hazed out with a soft feel."
"Can dated 2/3/17. Super fresh and tasting absolutely delicious. It doesn't get much better than Other Half brewing with Mosaic. So juicy, so aromatic, and so drinkable at 8.5%."
"Poured a slightly murky orange color with a fingers worth of foamy white head. The nose is all mosaic hops with with tons of fruits like berries and mangos, some pine, and earthiness. Very juicy, slight bitterness, and good malt backbone. Feel is on the creamier side, carbonated well, and slight burn from alcohol. Such a beautiful way to display the mosaic hop!"
"Dangerous the crushability level of this one. Berries and orange peel, like a fine softly carbonated herbal tea."
Loved this brew from start to finish (although very sad when finished)
"Canned 11/17/2016, pours cloudy orange gold color with a foamy 1 finger white head that faded very slowly and left outstanding lacing with rings as it went down."
"Pours merky tangerine with nice white head with nice lacing. Aroma passionfruit, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit and a light pine needles ."
"16 oz. can. Dark orange body. Smells of... wait for it... used pasta water. Yep. I stand by that. Also a strong citrus and garlic hop nose. The flavor is more heavily influenced by the mosaic. Citrus, garlic, tropical. Sweet pale malt. Strong oniony finish. Low bitterness. Medium body. Nice."
"Deep gold / light amber and cloudy. Big, fluffy white head. Tons of tropical fruit in the aroma. Some pine mixed in as well. The hops are bold and in your face. No malt to speak of at all. Flavor is unbalanced yet tasty, and the 8.5% is incredibly well hidden. Medium bodies with a bitter finish."
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter glass.
"Bursts of Blueberry set off this Mosaic-emphatic ""imperial"" IPA. Balanced well by pale malts."
Hazy dark burnt yellow orange.
"Having this after DDH mosaic dream. Look is again like orange juice. Smell is amazing but not as good as DDH dream. Initial taste is as expected. Extremely hoppy citrus goodness. Again, there is that slight bitterness at the finish but still smooth overall"
Poured from a 16oz can into a Speiglau IPA glass. 
L - looked clear coming out of the can but is chock full of haze in the glass. But of a dark burnt orange. Looks like mosaic!
"amazing east coast style double ipa, you would never have a clue its as strong as it is, until you drink three or four cans that is, but man this is smooth and juicy, nothing bitter or harsh about it. its a great expression of mosaic, without the cat urine component and balanced nicely by a hearty wheat malty base thats plenty dry. usually when an ipa, especially a big ipa, is not real bitter, its sweet and oily, thats just sort of the other side of it, but this is not any of that, its clean and bright, juicy but dry, really impressive complexion of the hops, especially for a single strain, and a wonderful texture that has to rank among the best in the business. maybe not quite as punchy as the nelson and motueka one they do, but man, this is really a pretty incredible picture painted of what mosaic hops are like in a beer like this, and for anyone bashing the hazy or ""under attenuated"" east coast ipa these days, i defy you to drink a can of this and declare it anything other than incredible. puts a lot of the west coast hyped hoppy beers to shame, it really does, and i do my best not to play favorites. absolutely elite level, tip top mosaic, it must have been a pricey beer to make with all these sexy hops! weird packaging but epic beer."
"This pours a hazy and juicy looking golden yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
Thanks for the trade SonnyJay.
"A: Big hoppy aroma upfront, floral and sweet, with lots of tropical fruit (mango, papaya)"
"got to share a growler with my friend. pours a semi hazy orange, head dissipates quickly. smell is truly mosaic through and through: orange, soft grapefruit, with a little bit of a dank ending. taste reminds me of Trillium Artaic, without the sweet honey back end. this is a big hop bomb: orange creamcicle, juicy grapefuit, but none of the bitterness associated with citrus. ends with a peach note that is blended with grassy notes. crackery malt for the hops to sit on. nice and fuzzy for a DIPA. i missed these guys...."
"Picked this up during Other Half's last release, liking the name and loving the can design even more. With ""Double Downer"" and a date of 7/15 on the bottom of the can, I was glad to have this fresh while wondering if this was a hopped-up versioin of the Debbie Downer from the previous release. In actuality, this beer should have been named ""All Mosaic Everything"" as it featured that hop beautifully while going down so smoothly as to make me forget how incredibly potent this was when it came to the booze!"
"Pours a bright orange with thin white head, great lacing. Nose is filled with melon, oranges, tropical fruit. Taste follows with nice hop bitterness and a clean, crisp finish. Great mouthfeel and abv well hidden"
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Thank you farnold for this generous extra. 
"If this beer is not rated 100, i won't understand. It's phenomenal, better than Treehouse bright. Balanced and juicy. "
Wow what can I say about this beer. It was absolutely phenomenal. I've had a few others from Other Half that have all been pretty good but this one stands out as the best by far. It reminds me of Bright from TreeHouse but may even be better.
Canned 7/16/16. Consumed 7/16/16.
"From a can dated 7/16/16 DOUBLE DOWNER. Dark yellow pour with a quickly dissipating head. Aroma is straight Mosaic; taste totally follows with waves of delicious Mosaicey goodness, a great balance of pine and pineapple. Slick mouthfeel and a sweet finish."
From 04/19/16 notes. 8oz. pour on tap at Pony Bar HK in NYC.
"L - saturated orange, 1 finger head fades to a thin layer"
"This one is good, but it is eclipsed by the double dry hopped version of this beer. This beer is a bit too sweet compared to the DDH version of this beer."
"APPEARANCE - Clear, light, 1FH."
The beer comes in a deep gold. 
"was pumped to see that this was just put up today since I was planning a stop for some fills for tomorrow. the name itself evoked thoughts of my favorite other half single hop but doubled...I envisioned a group of people trying this unnamed double mosaic tossing names around and someone exclaiming ""I dunno, it's kinda like a double mosaic dream"" and everyone nodding in agreement...thus forever naming this magical beer."
16 oz can 8/1/18
Growler picked up from the brewery.
"16oz can, purchased fresh at Trillium - Canton, poured into a Trillium Permutation Series stemmed glass. Enjoyed on 07.07.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
look is bright orange haze
"Pours like orange juice, thick juice haze of orange with foamy head and glue like lacing. Nose is loaded with hops, citrus, floral, and piney tones. Flavor is spot on, juicy hops with a light bitterness and semi sweet on finish. This IPA is just terrific, so well balanced and refreshing you cannot do much better, another world class beer."
"Pours cloudy yellow gold with a foamy 1-2 finger thick foamy white head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating slowly and leaving decent spotty lacing. Only above average looks, which is rare from a Trillium IPA."
Canned 19 days ago.
16oz. can into a Surly teku. 
"Look: Yellow, hazy, with thin head."
"Can shared by Dave, Thanks!"
I want to thank all of those who have been liking my reviews! Glad I can help spread my personal touch of good knowledge and helpfulness :-) 
A - Pours a turbid golden orange with a two finger fizzy white head. Heavy amount of soapy lacing. 
"Wow, for a middle of the pack Trillium beer, this is fantastic. Opaque yellow-orange with incredible lacing from bright white one finger head. Aromas and flavors were a cournicopia of tropical pineapple mango passionfruit. This is right in my wheelhouse."
"From the bottom of a can purchased from the Fort Point location: ""CANNED ON 11-JUL-17 07:37"""
This one is my least favorite out of the Double dry hopped versions of the Street offerings. Simcoe is a hop that I enjoy but with this beer it didn't out shine.
A: Poured into a Duvel tulip to a deep yellow that's hazy as hell with a dense two finger white head that fades to a collar around the edge of the glass with some lacing
"looks like juice with a thin white head. aromas of grass, lemon, plastic dankness, grapefruit, herbaceous and green. on palate is orange, grapefruit, spicy and dank hops, almost harshly hoppy but in a good way. as it warms this is also mango and passionfruit, juicy aspects come out but the green and pine notes are still there to offer balance. also some doughy malts and sweeter notes. mouthfeel is light but very fluffy. excellent stuff!!"
Big fruity profile. Tangerine. Pineapple. Mango. Grapefruit. Some crispness and bitter bite from the hops alongside the fruit forward notes. Easy drinking.
Look is a grapefruit milkshake. Haze for days.
"Poured into a 12 oz tulip glass canned in early April. Pours a very attractive cloudy dark yellow, with a excellent 2 finger sticky white head that leaves behind plenty of lace. "
"16 oz can. My phone predicted I would say ""Hazy orange,"" but this is definitely a murky orange. Take that, predictive text! Not much of a head. Smells of sweet orange with a little bit of resin and lemon. Tastes of sweet orange throughout. Pine resin and melon build in intensity. Becomes just a touch astringent. Medium body, almost chewy. It’s quite the hop expression. Dare I say too much? That might be harsh, as it is really tasty."
Hands down my favorite Trillium beer. I could drink this all day and night long - not sure how that would end. Everything is great about this beer. One of the few Trilliums i would put against Treehouse.
"This was lacking something that all the other Trillium beers had. A bit more dank, herbal, and way less juicy. Wasn't what I was expecting. Not sure what happened in the hop character."
Pounder Can > Snifter Glass
Serving: Can
Poured from the can into a tulip.
Gorgeous deep hazy yellow with a frothy white head that streaks clean down the glass with only a few lace reminders. Powerful balance between pine and guava aromas. Palate bursts with white grapefruit and lemon zest. Nice carbonation with a great late bittering dry finish that vanishes making you dive back for another sip. The aroma and flavor differ making for a brilliantly layered street.
"Pours an opaque orangish golden hue with white head. Slightly melony aroma. I get some melons up front, honey dew mainly, with some sedated resiny citrus and a touch of wheat on the finish. It's very soft. Good but not remarkable IPA."
"This is flat out great. Usually double dry hopped gets a little much for me but this is so well balanced its stupid. Great hop flavor, aroma, and great level of bitterness. Top notch!"
"Cloudy, almost white hue to the muddy color of near amber. Small head which leaves some blotches of lace. "
"Pours merky orange. Two finger white head. Great lacing. Aroma is light pineapple. Taste pineapple, orange flesh, mango and light dank finish. Excellent double dry hopped brew. Love trillium."
"Canned 3/23, poured into a Teku. Very deep orange, murky/hazy with no head even with what I thought was a pretty aggressive pour. Smells amazing out of the can with big hits of pineapple, peach and orange with a bread softness. A little more of the dankness comes out when in the glass. Not overly hop forward taste for a DDH. There is bitterness on the front but it gets balanced out with tropical fruits and malt. Great body on this one, nice full and juicy feel, modestly carbonated and a nice dry feeling you expect from a DDH IPA. Three more waiting for me in the fridge, lucky me!"
Super hazy and super tasty
"Poured 4/2/17 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery the previous day, into an imperial pint glass."
"Hazy golden draft pour, small head and good lacing. Juicy, dank nose, tropical fruits. Taste is led by the hops and finishes dry and bitter. Just huge."
"Great aroma! This is a must try for any IPA fan. My 8 year old daughter continuously commented on how ""dad's beer smells so good, like mango!"""
"cheers and thanks to Pete for snagging me a 4 pack of this along w the new anniversary glass! what can really be said about fresh trillium? these guys invented the juicy ipa...or at least perfected it. really raw and green...almost like hop rinds, but oh so juicy. love this one. So easy drinking and so damn tasty. has a great citric tropical dankness to it. mmm mmm mmm"
"Poured from can. Golden delicious. Head quickly gone with ok lacing. Love when I can smell a beer from far away. Crisp malt nose that hits the spot and citrus rinds. Taste matches. Good, clean fun."
"pours a murked out golden yellow, but slightly darker than their usual DDH street series. smell is big on the green hops, pine, and citrus. taste is the above smell with an added layer of juiciness and more leaning towards an orange citrus flavor rather than a lemon one. feel was very good, could have been a little fuzzier with how thick the beer is from the DDHing. their DDH versions of their beers are incredible, I am usually not a fan of simcoe but they someone swayed me with this one."
Can from brewery poured into fluted snifter.
"Tall can, stamp on the bottom ""1/30/17"""
L - swampy and dark. Quite a bit of murk going on here with a really solid shade of brownish gold. 
"First had 2/7/17 at home. Another one of the 4 packs I picked up on my trip to EBF. This beer smells of pure gold, hop gold that is. The flavor starts with smooth bitterness, and rolls to citrus, little pine, and finishes with a dry soft pear. The mouth feel is tops in the game. This is for sure my favorite IPA right now."
"Pours an extremely murky yellow/gold. Smells of pineapple, tangerine, lemon, and fresh cut grass. Flavor follows but not as strong as the nose would lead you to believe. Light in both bitterness and carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel."
16oz can dated 1/30/17.
"Canned 1/30/17, featuring Simcoe and Columbus hops, 7.2% abv..."
"Another good one from Trillium. It's very juicy, pretty much like drinking an orange/tangerine/grapefruit juice with pine needles. Mmmm, very good. So far I like it better than Congress, Mettle, heavy Mettle, Melcher, and Double Dry Hopped Melcher. Mouth feel -- a little slick on the tongue with some creaminess--medium bodied. Probably my favorite from Trillium to date. Go get some if you can, this one is awesome."
Growler filled an hour ago.
"Canned 11/17. Seems to have held up very well despite the 5+ weeks on it. Been refridgerated the whole time, though."
16oz can from a friend. Canned 11/17/6. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. 
"look is a gorgeous full bodied orange julius, super hazy golden and looks a mango orange. Aromas are on point, juicy tangerine nectar with some awesome dank grass, the smell really reminds me of Green from Tree House to be honest. its everything I want from an IPA in terms of nose. holy shit this is insane, I swear it would be straight up equals with Green from Tree House again, super soft with a medium body and a little kick of extra carb to amplify the grassy nectarine juice. It's crazy to say but this can fresh might be one of my favorite Trillium IPAs out there. everything about it is on point and this is my only can!"
"Wow the nose on this is absolutely phenomenal, I could be happy just sticking my nose in the snifter all night. Trillium DDH beers are amazing. Pours bright hazy orange with huge notes of melon and citrus flavor on the palate, so tasty and right amount of carbonation for a creamy smooth texture. Trillium needs to start distro to the rest of the country!"
"From a growler. Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 3/4 inch head. Taste is peach, tangerine, grapefruit rind, with a touch of pine and light black pepper towards the end. Medium bodied, slightly bitter that gets more bitter towards the finish. Nice and tasty. Kinda reminds me a bit of Treehouse Haze with a little extra zing at the end. Not in my echelon of Trillium beers, but probably the level right after that. Well worth seeking out."
Poured out as a hazy yellowish gold color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is packed with hops and the taste is too. Lots of hoppy elements throughout which I enjoy. The feel of the beer is smooth and creamy. Overall it's a damn good IPA.
"Look: Most turbid beer I have ever seen, almost no head, orange juice appearance"
16oz can from the Fort Point brewery in Boston
Trillium Double Dry-Hopped Summer Street
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter glass.
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma is dank, oniony with some mushy, overripe peaches. Taste has lots of overripe fruits, dank hops, grass, pine resin. Body is quite chewy and smooth. Overall it's another great example of a Trillium juicebomb."
"Got in a BIF from oline73. 16 ounce can into signature tulip glass, canned on 9/20/2016. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, honey, wheat, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, honey, wheat, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pine, honey, wheat, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modest bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Yet another disappointment. Pours a slightly murky body with a head that is gone in a minute down to a ring with a little lacing. Nose of subdued tropical fruit. Taste is led by that nose and then turns on a dime to that (moderate?) astringent bitterness. Feel is okay. Overall, this is probably my least favorite Trillium offering to date."
Poured at 45°F from a pint can (canned on 20Sep16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 21Oct16.
"16 oz can. Pours opaque yellow, finger white head lasts and leaves rings of lace. Aroma is a balance of juicy sweetness and dank weedy hops. Tastes like it smells, with the hops winning out, so dank, and all juicy around the edges. Medium semi soft feel, super dry finish. So good!"
"Itching to burst out of the can, with a little dome of whip cream foam popping out, this pours an opaque maize topped by a light but large four-finger off-white head."
"Hazy orange body with a nice white head. Nice semi-boldness of very tropical flavors going on in the scent and taste. Peach, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. A very refreshing combination. Some pineyness going on as well. Another great offering from Trillium that I finally got to try!"
"Corned pyurea color. Smell was a bit underwhelming give all the hops, but not necessarily bad. Taste was in similar as smell, tasty enough, but not given the ddh title and process. Feel was obviously very dense and full. But felt like chewing on muslin cloth filled with hop resin and yeast particulate. I'll tellya what kiddo, apprexiated the slightly detectable pressence of alcohol though. Feel like that can get lost in these bigbwoi hop slop NE IPAs. Not my top choice for trilium I guess."
The beer is a light yellow color with intense haze. Next to no head and no lacing but what was there was a light white foam. 
Can poured into a Weiss bier glass
Bottled 4/22/2016. 
beautiful hazy light peach color--- 
Bottled 4/22/16
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is an opaque, hazy, orange juice coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, feeding a foamy, frothy, clingy, white head. Aromas of juicy citrus notes forward, heavy on tangerine and orange rind, blending with dry, grassy hops characteristics. Very sweet, but balanced. Flavors are just as juicy and fruity on the palate, heavy on orange rind and tangerine again, but now joined by a heavy dose of grapefruit, tart and sweet. Solid resin and grassy backbone, dry and slightly bitter, enough to perfectly balance this palate. Smooth, crisp, slightly effervesced body that dries the palate, with a solid citrus and grassy lingering aftertaste. The finish is crisp and dry, as well, with a decent citrus sweet and slightly bitter linger. This is an absolutely delicious beer!"
Wow! What a fantastic beer. Trillium really crushes the double dry hopped game. Tropical nose that lasts for days. Amazing juice bomb of an IPA. Love it.
Look - That hazy golden orange type NE IPA color. 
Super hazy peachy orange in color. 1 finger white fluffy head that lingers.
"A - Textbook Northeast IPA a with beautiful, glowing pear-cream body and a small tower of white foam. Great retention and lace."
Hazy sunset yellow. White head.
"L: exceptional, as always. Poured into a pint glass and head was about 3/4"" thick. Head slowly dissipated but was very creamy white and held on for quite some time. Every sip left gorgeous lacing lines and several were left as reminders where you sipped. Looks like summer. Orange pineapple in color. "
L: Straight up hop smoothie with a hazy golden orange profile and creamy white head on top
4/22/16
"Pours a cloudy dark dank yellow color with a brilliant white head very fresh collar left with streaks of lacing , smell is dank citrus ,and lemon grass, and wisps of pine,taste is superb citrus mixes with lemon and pine hops an earthy dank garden taste with very little malt in the finish, some initial pine bitterness on the palate with super fresh citrus and tropical mango and grassy tastes to follow finishes dry with some prickly pine hops, could drink this all day,"
A double dry hopped masterpiece juicy hops smooth pour
"Underrated offering from Trillium in my opinion. Being from the west coast, I love how this beer combines the piney/resinous simcoe in a top-tier juicy New England style. I'm a fan of Summer Street, and this is definitely an amped up version of that. Mostly fruit hops on the nose and mid palate, finishes with a modest dry bitterness. Will go back for more next time it's out."
Poured from a 750ml bomber bottled 4/22/16 into tulip glasses:
"Pours a pale yellowish-orange with the typical Trillium haze and a half finger of white head, very reminiscent of orange juice. Aroma is citrus with some mango. Taste mirrors the aroma tangerine, mango, papaya, with a bit of pine and some notes of melon. Good mouthfeel, medium-light in body with moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer but the flavors here just don't suite my palate, the flavor combination here reminds me a bit of Green From Tree House. This is a solid NE style IPA, it's juicy and focused on tropical and citrus fruits."
"Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA"
"A - I love the hazy iPa look, golden hazy color with a big fluffy white head that sticks forever and leaves big lumpy lacing"
750ml bottle dated 04/22/16
"A great, great beer when you can get it. To call this a ""poor man's Julius"" is in no way disrespectful. There is a creamy, juicy mouthfeel that is second only to Julius with a fantastic tart bite at the end that keeps you coming back for more. If you live in Boston and don't want to drive 2 hours and stand in line for a six pack, Trillium can't be beat!. This beer is just as good and not nearly the hassle to obtain. Awesome job and I hope this sticks around for a few weeks!"
"Citrus explosion, an amazing well balanced brew. A top notch IPA."
"Hazy straw yellow with a small creamy white head on top. Aroma of orange citrus and tangerine. This full bodied creamy beer has soft carbonation. The flavor has orange citrus, tropical fruit, tangerine, and a little pale malt sweetness. Mild bitterness and lingering tropical notes when gone. Delicious easy drinking beer."
"Tropical and dank. Lots of citrus, tangerine, grapefruit peep and pith. Bitter, but rounded out by the cracker malt sweetness. Dry mouthfeel. Solid."
L- Hazy per normal. Light apricot(?) appearance. Great lacing and retention.
750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. 
"L: a yellowish orange hazy look, with a finger or so of white head"
Bottle shared by Michael T. Thanks man.
"Pours a gold/tan color that is hazy but not as cloudy as a lot of Trillium IPAs. The short soapy white head vanishes instantly, leaving no lacing."
murky yellow. nose super dank. super hoppy. really nice. trillium and ipa is always a success.
"Got this one in an IP trade, thanks Alex! Pours a nice cloudy straw color with a big head. Big citrus on the aroma, really dominating. Taste is really great. Gentle sweetness from some doughy malts, never overbearing. Tons of fruit, mostly lemon thanks to a bitter and tart finish. Feels much lighter than 7.2% ABV. Overall well executed and a great summer IPA."
"Rating based on 7 day old bottle. LOVE the nose, just wished the taste was equivalent. Still a great beer, and happy I have a few more bottles to enjoy."
Pours cloudy orange with nice lacing and a two finger head. Smells of grapefuit and tropical fruit... citrusy hops. Initial taste is juicy. A real a fruit citrus bomb up front with a nice crisp bitter finish. Sharp mouthfeel. Overall an amazingly delicious beer from Trillium. I'll buy any ____ Street IPA that they Double Dry Hop. There are only winners.
"Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a foamy white head. This one leaves nice lacing that coats the glass. Not a ton of aroma so I was surprised how much flavor this has. Bitter with lots of mango and grapefruit pith. The bitterness lingers on the middle of your mouth. A really good beer, not as balanced as Fort Point but still with seeking out."
"Pours a hazy golden, some lacing on the glass. Smell is on the tropical side with some earthy. Flavor is bright and hop filled, nice mango on the taste. Medium body, some carbonation. Excellent overall"
"Another fantastic IPA by Trilli-YUM! DDH version is so much more aromatic and bursts with hoppy goodness. Dank, citrus and piney hips are what I get. Fantastic brew!"
Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Trillium Tulip. Bottled Today at the Brewery. Purchased today at the brewery.
One of my favorite Trillium beers. Well done
"Poured into a 64oz growler on 6-30-15. Consumed on 7-3-15. Shared this with two good friends at the start of the holiday weekend after we first polished off a 64oz DDHFPA growler. Didn't have as high expectations for this one given some of the mixed reviews, but I found myself really enjoying this special beer too. Maybe not at quite the level of the DDHFPA but still a great standalone beer and another brilliant offering from the Trillium crew, who is absolutely killing it. Did not taste any of the yeastiness that some reviewers have complained of. I'd definitely love to have more of this brew."
64 oz growler was poured into a pint glass. 
Poured into growler on 6/19; drank on 6/20
This is a great beer. Love the street love the beer.
Poured into a 32oz Growler 06-18-15. Consumed 06-19-15.
"Canned 10/04/18, it pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 1-2 finger thick foamy off white head that faded slowly and left excellent lacing coating the glass, looking like a snow covered window in a blizzard. Three is as handsome as One and Two, so Sand City cranks out near perfect looking anniversary DIPA's or NE style IPA's, either category applies."
The beer pours a very nice white foamy head that dissipates quickly but leaves a good looking ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a good looking opaque and hazy moderate orange color to it. It looks really nice.
"On draft. Served in a goblet glass. Pours a creamy, hazy golden yellow body, slightly brighter than Sensei side by side, one finger white head, lots of retention, bits of lacing. Looks great. Smell is rich grapefruit, creamy sugar, citrus zest, touch of pine resin, caramel, mineral. Flavour is better than it smells, at least at first. Very hoppy grapefruit sweetness, bit of resinous pine bitterness at the end with a small amount of sugar and caramel in the middle, and a zestiness throughout. Good NE IPA character, with big aromatics coming across on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, soft and creamy, mild-moderate zesty bitterness supplanting the resin on the backend. A really very nice DDH IPA, lots of hop character comes across on the palate here."
"Master of Karate with the double dry hopping. Everything that makes MoK great, done better. Juicier. Fuller body. More potent flavor. It just becomes so addictive. This is one of those beers I get cravings for. That's how I can tell it is really good."
"On tap at the Parched Pig. Hazy orange. Smells of citrus, lime, woodsy hops, and a little sweetness. Tastes of grapefruit, more woodsy hops and lime. El Dorado? Sweet pale malt. Low bitterness. Medium heavy. Nice hop profile. Keeps it interesting."
Big thanks to Swedes for this gem
"Very good...Didn't think they could outdo OG MofK, but this was better."
Canned 10/6/17. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
"I didn't know how they could make this beer any better and they did! This beer is super smooth with a balancing bitterness. I get a basket of mangos, mangoes and more magoes. with other stone fruit notes hidden in there!"
"Appearance: A nice bubble show builds the head to two fingers, sitting atop the apricot nectar colored ""smoothie"" liquid; gobs of lacing hang around"
"Dark, hazy, looks like a fruit smoothly. Smells hippy and sweet. Taste is phenomenal. Tropical fruit as you would expect. Great mouthfeel. Just don't look at it."
"Well, hello, Johann the Mango Thief!"
"Really nice flavor profile, hops to start with a nice bite but still juicy. Finishes with very pleasant mango and vanilla notes. complex and very nice pillowy mouth feel."
16 oz can picked up last Friday from Aslin poured into a can glass
Poured an orange body with minimal head and the aroma is strongly mango but kind of light and clean although a touch of orange juice and vanilla sweetness comes through. Excellent balance in this medium-bodied beer as the vanilla aspect is well maintained that complements the tropical fruit/mango fruit flavors along with touches of acidity/orange flavors with clean finish.
Aslin - Johann the Mango Thief
Thank you cjgiant for this
Canned 5/23/17; drank 6/5/17 @ the Yarchives. 
Can dated mid-May:
Beautifully fruity nose. Taste is a Perfect balance between hops and malt without bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and hearty but also crushable. High ABV @9.4% but no taste of alcohol. Hints of vanilla and mango make appearances without overwhelming or dominating. Color is golden and cloudy like apple cider mixed with Orange Juice. My favorite from Aslin so far!
"From a 2-day-old can, pours a completely opaque burnt-orange. A finger of off-white foam recedes quickly. "
"Dark hazy burnt orange with big foamy lasting head. Big mango and peach nose and taste, with a nice creamy vanilla addition on the palate. Mouthfeel is as good as it can get, full, creamy, and nice moderate carbonation. Awesome beer!"
"Another great milkshake style IPA from Aslin, though its more of a smoothie I guess. This is their fan favorite juice bomb Mind the Hop conditioned on tons of mango and vanilla beans. I like to let these sit for a week or more to let the fruit meld. This has huge mango aroma that fills the room. The vanilla is feint but its their and gives these beers an almost creamsicle like quality. Huge mouthfeel, which I understand isnt for everybody. These bad boys are THICK. Citra forward and delicious, its hard to believe the Johann series clocks in a 9.4% Another good one from the Aslin boys"
"Not sure what's in the water in Virginia, but mother of god. A hop explosion literally bursting with tropical flavor and a nice large body. Smoothie IPA territory for sure, I bet you can't have just one."
"This is by far my favorite Johann series beer. Pours a copper orange with thick white lacy head. As soon as you open the can you can smell mango, citrus, among other tropical fruits. If you dig deeper you can get some biscuit notes that pairs well with the vanilla. Taste is very similar but more of a smoothy flavor. Huge mouthful with mild carbonation. Love this one!"
"Can from 1/19/17, poured into Belgian ale glass."
Aslin has a great juicy IPA base and this is just another one to add to the mix. First thing I noticed when pouring this beer was the amazing smell. You need to drink this beer out of a tulip to really enjoy it. Beer comes off a little tart but has a juicy mango/orange finish.
"With such a phenomenal base IPA, i believe it is very difficult to create a poor variant of it."
"The beer pours a nice light white head that dissipates fairly quickly. The beer itself is very nice to look at; it has a medium orange and yellow appearance with a nice mango juice texture. In fact, it's pretty much a mango juice look alike."
"On draft at the brewery. Pours a super hazy deep orange, nose is very fruity. Mango and fruit dominate on the front end, with the vanilla giving a little kick at the end. Love the juice, not sure how I feel about the addition of the vanilla..."
At the brewery today and some crowlers for later mmmmmm....
Canned on 10/19/18
"A- Tallboy into a narrow becher with a hazy, kinda cloudy pale golden body and a three finger foamy-creamy white head. The cap shoots up fast but falls slowly with great retention. Thick webs of lacing off the glass a few mm and the pillow stays around throughout the entire experience."
"16 oz. can. The first 75% of the can pours hazy orange and then the last 25% pours like I just added orange sherbet to my glass. Smells of tropical fruit, sweet citrus, mango. Tastes of mango all over. Light citrus pith at the fringes. Sweet juicy backdrop. The pith flavor is the only source of bitterness. Thick and creamy texture. This is delicious and I am fully aware that in most other circumstances I would find a beer like this to be undrinkable."
Another juice bomb with all of the classic treehouse flavor. Had a 12 pack of this version and down to my last couple. Cheers!
Canned 8/3/18
Probably my favorite Bright variations.
Fresh can poured into a fluted snifter.
Smells like a popsicle. Lemon lime and orange sorbet. Delicious!
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA"
Possibly my favorite from Tree House. Just a pure joy to drink.
"Hazy gold, white head, nice distribution of spots of lacing. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, pith and pine aromas. Tastes nice and sweet with a ton of mango, pineapple, some grapefruit and pine. Fantastic beer."
"Smell: Really sweet tropical hard candy. Like pineapple jolly ranchers, peach rings, candied dried mango, dehydrated oranges. Underneath that I’m getting pink bubblegum note that is reminiscent of big league chew. There’s a touch white bread. Also there is a good amount of an herbal hop quality. "
"Aptly named--golden haze, full mouthfeel, light and refreshing. Galaxy hops come at you with citrus and pineapple with an clean, understated intensity that will banish a summertime thirst."
Can stamped 05/10/18
"One of my favorite from Treehouse. The puffy cloud head, the orange haze and all the best of galaxy present in the nose and taste, with just enough balance from the malt."
"The pour, my goodness the pour! Had to have been a two inch head revealtsone very citrusy aromas. Probably not my favorite of the Brights even though I love galaxy hops but still a great drink!"
"Pours with traditional Tree House foamy head and lacing. A bit more yellow in color than most of their NE IPAs, but definitely retained the haze. What separates this for me from the other Bright varietals is the lime (and some lemon) on the taste and finish. A great summer treat and easily my favorite in the series."
"Pour hazy, orange-gold in color with one inch head. Taste is lemon, lime, and pineapple with a spicy/peppery finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation and sweet. Makes for a worthy addition to the Bright family. I prefer the Nelson variant, but this one just edges out Citra and is well ahead of the rest of the group."
"Hazy grapefruit color with some floaties and a billowy off-white head. Dank grapefruit notes on the nose, plus some more exotic aromas."
"Yum. Grapefruit, melon, orange, pine and grass. Cracker malt. Dank and resinous. Not too sweet, but works very well with the bitterness. A bit watery but overall, real good."
"I'll ding the appearance a bit because it's supposed to be their non-NE IPA (variant hop probably contributes to that), but that aside this is a great beer. Nose and taste are tons of overripe pineapple/peach. Texture is great, though again not exactly what I'd expect with a supposedly more clean IPA."
"Canned 3/23. Vibrant yellow/orange color, hazy with impressive head and lacing. Smell is out of this world with bold sweetness and tropical notes. Taste is a little more tart/tangy than I was expecting but there is a nice sweet balance with a perfect hop-bite. Great amount of carbonation with a smooth finish. Best Bright variant I have had so far though I haven't had many. I would seek this one out again and recommend you do the same."
On tap. Poured all hazy and glam. Aroma was pungent juice. Flavor was even better. The Galaxy hops give this a stunning flavor. I have started to come down pretty aggressively from NEIPAs but this one was tasty and I thought it tasted better than Julius which is one of my favorites.
I dont smoke but picked up a marijuana smell and taste. Weird
"Can. Beautiful orange-yellow opaque color, with a good amount of lacy frothy foam upon aggressive pour. Great carbonation. This is packing ripe tropical and citrus aromas and flavors. Very well rounded taste that follows the nose, and a creamy soft, fluffy mouthfeel. My favorite Bright variant and one of the best Galaxy hopped beers I've had. When it comes to a beer like this, it ticks all the boxes."
On tap at brewery
Poured on draft at the brewery.
"pours out absolutely beautiful golden hazed color super thick and creamy dense bright white head decorates the glass with thick globs of lace. this one is quite aromatic and palate matches beautifully, lots of pineapple and orange sorbet, grapefruit, pine, grainy malt notes, dankness, creamy peach and mango, has that hint of bubblegum sweetness that I get from a lot of TH. mouthfeel is oh so soft, medium bodied. overall an absolute masterpiece!"
A: Poured from the can into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is murky yellow with a 1-finger tight-bubbled white head that leaves behind a good amount of foamy lace.
"Moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a cloudy (not bright!) body with some nice sticky lacing. Nose of tropical fruit, citrus, and a bit of floral/herbal notes as well. Taste mirrors nose very nicely with a soft citrus pith bitterness on the finish. Feel is soft for a Bright in my opinion, but still nice. Overall, the haziest of the Brights I've had and thanks to Rob, my TH Man, for the hook-up. Cheers!"
"Big thanks to rudzud for this one, canned 3/23/18"
"Picked-up four cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton for $4.05 per can. Canned-on date of 3/23/18. This is my second brew that I have tried from these guys from yesterday's haul. Delicious...reminds me of another brew, just can't put my finger on it. Worth the sojourn."
"L - yessss been waiting for this one. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations! Trying to figure out the color scheme here... Citra is orangey and therefore orange... Nelson is grapey and therefore green... Simcoe & Amarillo is piney and so the green+red makes sense, kinda leafy... but pink? Let's find out. Definitely way hazier than typical Brights. Looks like pineapple juice with a white white head. "
love treehouse to me this is the best
Picked up some cans of this at the brewery tonight of their small pilot batch. 
Canned today. 
This beer smells like the Treehouse brewery. It's pure juice and one smooth beer. I'm having a hard time believing it's 7.8% as there is no trace of alcohol. Definitely my favorite of the Brights so far!
A - Opaque light orange tan color with thin lacing and no carbonation.
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/01/18. Served in a spiegelau-style IPA glass."
Appearance: Arrives cloudy with a pale orange cast topped by two fingers of foam; good lacing action
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/17/2018. Pours very hazy/cloudy golden orange/amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, strawberry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, strawberry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, strawberry, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, fairly sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mildly increasing warmth of 11%. Overall this is an awesome NE DIPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the ABV, with the melloely bitter/drying finish. Nice soft feel, not overly aggressive. Awesome Citra/Mosaic showcase. Very juicy and fairly dank/earthy hop complexity; balanced bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. Was surprisingly lightweight for the 11%. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma has dank, sweaty hops and milky yeast notes. Taste is sweet and malty but clean with lots of fruity hops. Sweetish, intense and a bit warm from the high ABV."
"Canned 4/17/18, poured 5/27/18. Dark, murky orange in color. Nose is somewhat sweet, somewhat malty, with notes of orange, grapefruit, and canned peaches that were maybe just a little too ripe. Flavor is sweet, resinous, and dank, with more of that sugary peach syrup vibe. Carbonation is very light. The alcohol is very present, but less in the form of burn, and more in a way that makes you feel like you're drinking a stiff mixed drink; it somehow merges with the flavor. By no means one of those ""can't believe this is a TIPA"" TIPAs. Big, heavy, and enjoyable if that's what you're in the mood for."
"Pours a turbid orange to copper with a thick off white head on heavy pour. Nose is citrus forward with a mix of floral and malt. Taste is pretty citrus driven. Orange peel, grapefruit pith and lemon zest. Some light mellow mango in there as we’ll all on a sweet dough maltiness. Some grasses and very light hints of floral but this really is a citrus bomb. Huge creamy mouthfeel, silkiness to it. Hoppy bit to finish. A bit boozy particularly when she warms."
"The body has a nice medium orange look with a good yellow hue to it. The smell consists of a nice, mainly dry hop grassy pine bitterness with some moderate grapefruit. The taste has a slight sweetness in the taste and an alcohol note that runs through it among the grapefruit notes. It has a heavy body but slightly creamy but more smooth, which makes it pretty drinkable."
"Drank on tap at The Veil Brewing Co., Richmond, VA"
Tall can ....11/06/17...just under a month in the can.
"Poured a cloudy orange body with minimal head and lace with an aroma that to me really wasn't striking except minor orange/acidity. Smooth, easy drinking, the booze is well-hidden and the bitterness is minimal as the beer is clean and has a mostly sweet tangerine and acidic orange balancing act going on and clean finish."
Can stamped 11/06/17
"A: pale straw with medium head, light head retention and nice lacing. Cloudy"
L: Light orange yellowish color. A little less than a finger of white head. Looks like orange or fruit juice.
"Can dated 7/03/17 Poured into a tulip. Poured straight OJ looking with a nice white head leaving solid lacing behind. The smells were straight pineapple, papayas, candied mangoes, dank. Taste is almost identical to the smell! The feel is thick chewy and the hops coat the mouth and linger for a while! A little burn in the back from the 11%. Overall it's another solid veil beer!"
"Hazy yellow color, thin head. Smells like orange and pineapple, hops also strong in the aroma. Juicy hoppy taste. Lots of orange and tropical fruit flavor. Medium body and mouthfeel, strong carbonation bite. The high abv has some hotness to it, but the taste is not overly boozy. Very good NE style Triple IPA."
"Pours an opaque, bright gold color with a 3 finger fizzy biscuit-colored head that settles quickly down to a film. You can hear the fizzing on the initial pour, so seems plenty effervescent."
"Wonderful New England style dbl IPA. I gotta be thinking that Foam has to be a destination brewery. I can make a case for up there with Trillium and Treehouse. Not on par yet and maybe never but what I have had from Foam compares. This Built to Spill is superb. I am not good at all the ratings with individual stuff. I just know when I have a decent beer, or a good brew and certainly when I have a a mouth feel and taste like this. Exceptional. I just wish I lived in the area and am great full for a friend who brings me some when he visits me in Maine."
"First sip was just meh, but as this opens up it.is truely amazing. There is a more floral note than you see in many NEIPA and an acidy that enhances the citrus hop notes. Really brilliant.combination."
"Pours a hazy light straw color. Nice citrusy aroma. Unique hop flavor here - slight pine, ample cirltrus, and floral. Nice. Carbonation lends itsself to its creaminess. Overall a cool brew, very enjoyable."
"16 oz can, dated 2/22/18, poured into a teku "
Yum!
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Very nice juicy, citrus aroma. Orange, grapefruit and mild piney resin. Taste follows the same pattern, but get more pineapple at the end. Nice bitter piney hop up front. Medium bodied with mild to moderate carbonation. Very good beer."
"Fresh can poured into a wheat beer glass. Very white but minimal head. Very hazing orange, yellow. Looks like grapefruit juice. Nice fruity aroma and taste. Juice bomb"
"Tall can, about 5 weeks in the can"
Serving: Can
I visited Foam recently and came away very impressed. The brewery is not real big and not the easiest to get to but well worth it. This is another tasty brew from Foam. Smooth and drinkable but full of citrus goodness. Cheers
"Was good the first time I had it, but the second time was amazing! Very good NE IPA worth the hype! Super juicy!"
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass to weeks old. Appearance is straight OJ with one finger thick head and low retention. Smell is fresh pineapple juice, OJ, floral hops, resin, oats, and some earthy/pine notes."
Had on-tap at the brewery and also poured from a tallboy can into a tulip
Can: Poured a cloudy bright yellow color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of juicy hops with dry floral hops notes with some grapefruit notes and some light resinous notes. Taste is a great mix of juicy hops notes with dry floral undertones with some grapefruit notes. Body is full with good carbonation. Another nice NEIPA but finish is maybe a tad dryer then I was expecting.
"Can received in trade with Eric. A touch thin, but great flavour"
"This one pours a very hazy orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Appearance: pours a cloudy light orange color with a 1/2"" head. "
Can shared by Mike. Thanks! 
"Not my favorite style, but I'm trying to appreciate DIPA's. Loads of citrus on the nose. Solid hop backbone. Loads of fruit up front and bitterness on the finish."
"Enjoyed one of these on tap at the brewery. Poured very cloudy golden, moderate lacing as it went down. Aroma dominated by citrus, tangerine especially to me. Very nice citrus dominated hop taste with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel for the style. I would definitely enjoy one of these again!"
great beer. Could throw this into treehouse's lineup and not know the difference. a slight bite to it but overall nice citrusy and hoppy IPA. Foam is a real player
"Drank on tap at Foam Brewers, Burlington, VT"
L - hazy orange with a touch of yellow. Alright I'm done looking at this beer because it smells delicious! 
From growler
"On tap at the brewery. They poured this into a tall tulip. The appearance was a glossy yellow color with a thin white head. Mild lacing after head dissipation. The smell started off with a big sweet tropical fruits to a nice resinous underscore of juicy sweet to bitter citrus rind. The flavor brings about all of the previously mentioned flavors to boot. Exceptional fresh bittersweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sipping quality about it. Carbonation seems good for the style and for me. Overall, damn nice DIPA that I would love to have again."
"For me, this was IPA nirvana. I have not yet had the chance to try Tree House or Toppling Goliath IPAs, but I've had many of the incredibly delicious Vermont IPAs and this ranks at or near the top. Please keep making this beer!"
"750 mL bottle. Hazy bright orange. Smells of soft citrus, tropical fruits, and some grapefruit. Tastes of orange, grapefruit, some alcohol. Tropical fruit and a little bit of sweet pale malt in the back end. The finish has a lingering alcohol flavor. Low carbonation. Medium heavy. Smells really good, but maybe doesn’t quite deliver beyond that."
"This is definitely in my top 5 Vermont beers, and one of my favorite beers ever. Hazy as hell, awesome pineapple/grapefruit combo, unbelievably drinkable."
"Love it! First trip to the brewery right now and fell in love at first sip. A great New England double IPA, juice bomb with distinctive hints if pineapple which is lovely! Want more!"
"This was my first offering from Foam and I'm having a real hard time seeing what everyone else is seeing in this beer. I kind of associate 'juicy' with round flavors and while there is some mild pineapple-like flavor and aroma, its relatively one dimensional and that lacking roundness is something that I've come to crave from places like Trillium and Tree House. There's some crackery malt dryness as well mid-sip that counteracts the juiciness that I'm assuming they are going for with this New England style/hazy IPA and I'd go as far as to say there's an overall feeling of blandness/muted flavors. There's no flavors that really pop and if it was a food item, I'd say it would need salt. I would give this one a low 4 but that's besides the point - you either want to drink this again or you don't and I really don't. If this beer came from a brewery in a random city or town, I'd say this was probably the locals first foray into the hazy, turbid IPA that is all the rage and was such a change from the regular run-of-the-mill West Coast style piney and dry IPA that there's an inflation in the score that should be taken into consideration, but Burlington knows great beer and since my experience is far from what others have stated, maybe I just had a bad batch."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a opaque pale yellow with 2+ inches of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a blend of citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, papaya, tangerine and lemon. The taste is lots of pineapple at first followed by mango and papaya. Slightly boozey. Heavy body and slightly dry. Overall, fantastic Imperial IPA."
"A: Hazy, straw colored yellow with a thin white head."
On tap at the brewery. This beer absolutely blew me away especially compared to all the other great beers you can drink in Burlington. In my opinion this surpasses all of them. Incredibly aromatic and juicy. Can't put this one down.
"Damn good, on draft at the brewery"
"Thick hazy gold pour, almost orange, smaller ring of head. Tangerine, grapefruit in the aroma, floral and juicy. Taste is huge citrus up front, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lighter pine notes, biscuit malt. Bittersweet aftertaste, bang on perfect mouthfeel. Can this and watch the money roll in."
"Wow. Just had a Pavement, now Built To Spill. Much like Pavement, pours a very turbid light golden color with a decent white head. Looks like pineapple juice. Aroma is also very pineapple and other tropical fruits. I don't get the earthy pine aroma that I got with Pavement. This one is straight up juice. Taste follows the nose. Pineapple juice is the main flavor with other tropical flavors as well. This is a juice bomb for sure. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy. Subtle bitterness for a IIPA. This is just an outstanding beer!"
Simply put this was one of the best beers I have ever had. Wish I could get it all the time. Could easily be mistaken for a treehouse offering. Get this one if you can.
Poured from a 750ml spring top into a Belgian tulip.
"L: Pale yellow, very turbid. Pours a 1 finger soapy head that fades quick but easily coaxed by swirling."
"Pours an opaque yellowish hue. The aromatics are pleasant citrus. It is very pithy. Harshly so. Tons of citrus, but it is of the bitter variety. I imagine this has some galaxy hops, and their presence is a little bit bucking bronco. Out of control to be more blunt. Not in a over the top way. Just more in their presence in the beer. I can't say that it helped that this beer was said to have some pineapple character. Nope."
"Poured into their fluted snifter at the brewery, this is one hazy brew! Big foamy head on top of a creamy yellow body, completely opaque."
Consumed from a one-day-old growler on 8/8.
Only reason these guys don't have all the hype of certain other Vermont breweries is that they're brand new. Watch out for Foam.
750ml swing top poured into a flute.
"hazy golden orange, tight head with a few patches of lace. nose is orange, gummy sweetness, citrus peel, light grass. on the palate is grapefruit, orange, pine, light bready malt and a touch of alcohol. feel is slightly watery and would be my only complaint on this brew. overall its definitely worth trying, cheers!"
Growler poured into a stange and a snifter
Poured from the growler one day after filling.
"On tap at the brewery, served in a tulip glass:"
Pours a hazy golden orange color with a 1-finger foamy white head. The head settles into a nice ring around the top of the beer. 
Soft and luscious mouth feel with flavor full of mango and tangerine. Super easy to drink.
"Pours a crisp yellow gold with a finger of foamy head that settles to a thin cap. Wonderful citrus aroma, pineapple and tangerine. Taste follows nose. WOW. Really Wow."
The beer comes in a glowing hazy light gold.
Purchased in a 750ml bottle.
"Love this one. Had a couple of tastes of other beers I was ""supposed"" to like more prior to this, but I'm stopping now and keeping this one. Fruity and coats your tongue from front to back. A little alcohol taste, but close to perfect."
Straw color. Great nose of hops and citrus. All encompassing mouth feel. Serious hops intensity. Big brother to hurricane. An upgrade over the regular typhoon.
"Canned 11/1. Gorgeous looking NEIPA as you’d expect from Tree House. Lots of head that sticks around a bit after an aggressive pour. I’m surprised I don’t get as much of a smell as I do from some other super fresh NEIPAs. A bit more bitterness than some super juice bombs I’ve had, and I like it for that balance. Pillowy soft mouthfeel. I’d definitely get it again!"
"Picked-up six cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton on Saturday, canned-on date of 11/1/18. This is my 21st brew reviewed from these guys. Decent, but not one of my TH faves, dank smell, a bit of a bland taste."
Consumed 11/7/18
Tropical bubblegum
"Had this on 2018-11-04 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2018-10-17"
Canned on 10/17/18
"um, wow! Treehouse is the king!"
Hazy golden orange pour with two fingers of white head.
"Pours a hazy milky yellow color with a well retained half inch white head that left some lacing. Smells of tropical and citrus fruits with a bit of pine. Tastes of orange, orange zest, passion fruit, mango, papaya and a bit of pine. Medium bodied and carbonated, creamy mouth feel, mild bitterness."
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/17/18. Served in a very fancy tulip."
Poured into a 13 oz Funk Brewing Teku Glass canned on 9/21/18. Pours like a glass of OJ with a big fluffy 2 plus finger head that leaves beautiful marks of lace with excellent retention. 5
"Man, what an unexpected add to New Odds & Sods Beer Sunday (Week 711)! I was contacted by a user on another beer site through Facebook Messenger (!) to see if I would be interested in sending some rather pedestrian CANs in return for my choice(s) of a buncha Tree House CANs! 8=O I replied in the affirmative but I said that I would happily just send him the ones that he wanted, gratis. He then insisted that I pick some of his stash & it was an offer that I CANnot refuse as the founder of The CANQuest (tm)! I didn't want any of their vaunted NEIPAs nor was I taken with a lot of what he had listed, but I hit upon a Milk/Sweet Stout & this one, both styles that I usually enjoy. Thank you, sir, but this seems like overkill. "
Poured on draft at the brewery.
TREE HOUSE SUPER TYPHOON IPA 10/2/18
"a: hazy, bright matte orange color with a hint of amber. frothy 2 finger off-white head. super-thick looking"
"Look: Deep orange and murky, with a good size white foam head. Lacing for days, "
Canned 4 days ago. 
"Pours hazy, faint gold in color, with half inch head. Taste is big tangerine, passion fruit, and mango lassi. Medium bodied, sweet, moderate carbonation. Wow is this a great beer. I like Tornado and Hurricane and this is so much smoother and creamier. Body is amazing. May have to plan my Tree House trips around when this gets released."
Very solid Double. Prefer Haze and Doppelgänger though
"Grapefruit juice in my glass, with a dense, light tan head. Tropical citrus notes on the nose, with oranges, passion fruit, and something akin to prickly pear."
"got one can of these. Nice looking color and decent smell. This is very drinkable. For whatever reason i don't care much for the APAs that Treehouse puts out IN COMPARISON to there IPAs. This one is no different. i just feel like something is missing. With that said, that maybe much more of a personal preference as opposed to the facts. This is a good beer that is worth trying."
"OK beer, somewhat muddled taste and off-putting nose, far from one of their best. Buy one if you're there anyway, but not worth: a) driving any distance for, b) standing in line for, c) $4 or whatever a can. Take that $4, double it, and buy a 6 pack of Lagunitas Sucks, Maximus, or Brown Sugga and you'll be way ahead of the game."
Great Double IPA
"The commercial notes are right on with this one, especially about it getting better as it warms. Very drinkable for a double IPA."
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into a snifter. the beer pours a hazy goldenrod color with fluffy bleached white head of 2 cm foaming up. 
"Poured from a can dated 6/22/18. Pours a nice opaque tangerine orange with about two fingers of foamy white head. Smell is citrus. I get some tangerine, but overall, just a lot of citrus. Taste is sweet, but not overly sweet. Again, tangerine sticks out for me, but it's just a very nice fruit taste. One of my favorites from Tree House. The mouthfeel is medium and drinks very nicely. Just an overall great beer."
"From can. Deep orange, opaque appearance. Good bit of foam head generated upon aggressive pour. Very much a tropical, ripe fruit aroma and flavor. Excellent mouthfeel for DIPA."
"Pours pretty much the standard Treehouse color with a huge, frothy, cappuccino-like head. Notes of citrus, melon, and a distinct hint of lime. Something sweet and creamy for a moment, almost like vanilla. Body is fluffy and smooth. One of the best Treehouse beers."
L: Cloudy peach and sunny hues with a wispy white foam head and copious lacing
"Canned on June 22, 2018; consumed on July 3, 2018."
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA"
"L: that TH pale haze you come to exect lacing is slight less the some of the core beers, nose is a also a tad under as well after to take a deeper sniff but like that the taste is different more bitterness seem presence and overall not just a fruit juice bomb and mean that as a compliant seem more balance with bitterness, aroma and taste."
"Pours a chilled hazy orange/off-white with a one finger head. Smells of pineapple, mango, citrus galore. Some peppery aroma as well. Flavor is a smooth balance cocktail of tropical into a bready cracker malt. Faintly sweet. Closing out with some bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and lush, slightly chewy. Very well balanced and delicious."
16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. 
16 oz. can.
Don’t know how they hit a home run every time. Getting to the point where I don’t like any beer that is not Treehouse. If you have a chance just max out you’re allotment of this beer. I like lots of fresh beer from local brewery’s but the bar is set very high at this place. Enjoy also what is available at local breweries as this style and many other styles are truly a work of art!!!!
"Pours a hazy golden color with average white head, maybe 1.5 finger that falls off sort of quickly leaving abundant lacing on sides of glass. Citrus and hops hit the nose but not to strong at all. Taste follows with grapefruit, a little lemony flavor and then the hoppiness comes through at the end. This is a well balanced brew, very satisfying and super easy to drink. A creamy mouthfeel along with the great taste on this one made it disappear too quickly. "
Poured from the can into a snifter.
My buddy hooked me up with this and I just poured it into a tulip. Typical Tree House Hazy look with that wonderful citrus fragrance. Taste is juicy and hoppy per usual. Great new beer!
"I've been fortunate enough to have had a selection of the Tree House brews and this one was everything I expected. It has a very good Hop aroma with a Citrus taste. Super hazy with a unique orange colour. You would almost think you were about to drink a glass of orange juice. There's a nice aftertaste too it but not in a pallet killer kind of way . I didn't find it too overpowering, nor did I find the taste too boozy. However, for the uninitiated, you will know you're drinking an IPA and that can be an acquired taste. If you're new to IPA's and Tree House is the brew you're getting your feet wet with, well, lucky you!!"
"This one pours a very hazy orange color, with a small head, and lots of sticky lacing."
1 wk old can. Thanks Berni . 
"Look pretty similar to Hurricane: opaque light orange/yellow with a foamy off white head. Smell is oranges, melon and limes. Tastes follows with the same, but more lemon-lime like. I wouldn’t say it’s a marketable improvement over Hurricane, but it’s still very good."
"L - Super Typhoon? Okay. We're getting a pale shade of impenetrably hazy orange. Getting a bit dark toward the center there. Like the eye of a TYPHOON amirite?! The head consists of good-sized bubbles that retreat quickly, leaving a thin film behind. "

"Canned 5/24/18, big thanks to rudzud for picking this up and sharing"
"As advertised, Hurricane but kicked up a notch. Great beer, tropical fruits, accompanied by the super soft mouthfeel that meets the Tree House standard. Fuller body, compared to Hurricane. Absolutely wonderful overall."
Can dated 5/24/18
"I received this beer from a recent BIF. I never heard of this brewery and my first Vermont beer. The temperature of the beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The hard pour on the beer produced a two finger head with lousy retention. The white head was airy and creamy. The head dissipated quickly leaving no lacing on the glass. A thin ring is all that remains in the glass. Colors are a medium gold with amber hues, SRM 5. The haziness in the beer produces no clarity. "
Poured from the can into a tulip.
"Tall can, from the source a few hours ago. Canned 8-30...2 days ago"
"Nice hazy, bright orange color with a finger head. Not much lacing on the glass. Some dank aromas with fresh citrus and papaya. A bit on the dry side with some hop bitterness, slightly tart citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Medium body feel with good amount of carbonation. Has a nice spicy finish and lasting hop flavors."
"This is an amazing DIPA that is well balanced, bitter but not over the top, juicy but not overly so, but at the same time it doesn't have the crazy wow factor. But I think it makes it pretty drinkable."
Absolutely amazing NEIPA. 
A: Poured into a tulip glass to a hazier than hell yellow topped by a finger of dense white head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing

"16 oz can, dated 6/21/18, poured into a teku"
"From can. Pale yellow color, really hazy. Sweetish malt notes and juicy hops. Taste is sweet, juicy, fruity, really hoppy with milky yeast notes. Medium body and carbonation. Balanced, easy drinking, bitter on the finish with grapefruit rind flavor."
Thanks goes out to larryi86 for this brew.
"Canned 01/11/18, it pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head that was packed with bubbles, dissipating very slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. Looks like pineapple juice after the head goes away."
"Pours a vibrant hazy orange with a two finger head. Smells of citrus, melon rind, cereal, stone, and a little peppery. Taste is juicy with a present bready malt, bitterness, well balanced. Plenty of good malt shining through and not overly bitter or overly juicy. Nice and smooth, clean water. ABV well disguised. Mouthfeel is crisp and easy drinking. Really good well made and well balanced double."
Pint can in a fine stemmed tulip glass.
Good citrus flavor with all the hops a NE IPA can deliver. Foam Brewers definitely scores with this one.
"great beer here, only a little hazy, and bursting with citrusy hoppy goodness, fresh as can be, highly refined compared to a lot of its muddy murky cloudy heavy east coast peers. this glows in the glass under a tall white lace head, and it smells like candied lemon, tangerine, and lime, really sort of crystallized hoppiness, intense, awesome. the flavor is as good as the nose, and while there is a mild tropical fruit complexion in the taste also, i think the citrus characteristics really dominate, again a little sweet in its oiliness at times, a honey note, and a drying almost lager tasting yeast to me that is both subtle and unexpected, it gives a little more base to this, earthy, great with the intense hops, and also more bitter in the end than a lot of these are, it really has a great finish to it, and drinks a lot easier than it strength normally allows for. to me it tastes summery, incredibly fresh to me, and balanced in a brighter way than many. i havent had a lot of beer from foam, but this is fantastic, and i have enjoyed all of their stuff so far! thanks to my brother for sending this can out my way, awesome art on the label too!"
A pint can serving. 
Slightly hazy golden beer that leaves a few globs of lacing. Smells like overripe citrus and pine. The taste is sweet citrus and big pine. Really nice beer.
Can received in trade
Poured from a 16 oz. can.
"Appearance: hazy orange in color with a 1/2"" head that falls to a spotty surface covering."
Look was clear and lots of floaties. Smell was faint fruit/dank. Taste was fruity but bitter. Feel was dry and chalky. Overall not sure i would get this again.
can generously kicked down from THE rowmark (thanks bud!)...no idea which batch this is from...
"On tap at the brewery. They poured this into a tall tulip. The appearance was a hazy glossy yellow color. Thin finger of white head. Delicate lacing. The smell starts off with fresh sweet danky onion rolling into some sweet fresh tropical fruits. Delicate resin underneath. The flavor brings it all together allowing a nice gentle stickiness of the tropical fruits and resin bitterness to combine nicely. Combined bitter resin to sly tropical sweet aftertaste with the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sipping to sessionable bitter feel to it. Carbonation seems good for the style. Overall, fantastic DIPA that I would love to have again."
"From a 750ml growler, filled 04/28/17. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
"L - dark, milky, frozen orange. Top layer is light orange yellow and all the darkness sinks to the bottom. "
"Hazy orange pour, larger puffy white head. Huge mango up front in the aroma and taste, passionfruit, tropical fruit juice, lighter resin notes, sligthly dank. Creamy mouthfeel. Hard to choose between this and built to spill."
Outstanding!
"These beers really floor me. Hit a grand slam at Turkey dinner. This is also very quite hazy (although maybe slightly less than Baby Name). Similar in color but maybe a little lighter with a bit of orange peach hue. Medium head that wants to linger. Tropical ripe pineapple and sweet mango aroma as well as citrus zest. Flavor follows through with huge hop character while still being light and refreshing on the palate. No detectable booze for 8.2% and very dry DIPA for a somewhat sweet tropical aroma. Feel is great. If you are looking for a slow sipping DIPA you might find this to be a little light or thin on the mouthfeel. If you want to find the glass never leaving your lips, this is exactly what you want."
On tap at Foam. Hazy orange with a medium white head. Smells of all tropical hops. A hint of alcohol. Tastes tropical as well. Light sweetness. Has just a bit of a bite that balances the sweet juiciness. Medium heavy. Soft carbonation. Excellent.
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy orange color with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of juicy tropical fruits. Mango, papaya, tangerine and grapefruit. The taste mirrors the aroma. Fleshy papaya, mango, and grapefruit. Dry and slightly tart, but bitter. Slightly floral finish. Medium bodied with a mild alcohol presence. I will be grabbing more of this on my visits to VT."
Tasty beer 
"L: Hazy, somewhat milky, golden orange with large white head. This lasts and leaves nice lacing."
"Juicy, yet sharp. Hazy, and hoppy as hell, but only lightly astringent. Huge hop character of mango, guava, then sweet grapefruit and orange peel. Maybe a hint of pine and grape skin. 8.2% but drinks like a regular IPA. I'll take another."
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
Growler shared by Paul.
"The beer comes in light gold, bright, hazy. "
"Pours a very turbid, light yellow with a fluffy white head. Looks like juice in a glass. Aroma is mango, lemon, and lots off earthy pine. Very pungent and very aromatic. Can smell it from quite a distance. Taste like citrus juice with an earthy pine aftertaste. Definitely follows the nose. Very creamy mouthfeel with medium bitterness. This is a great beer! Amazing that Foam Brewer's has been around for less than a year and already have beers that can compete with the top Vermont breweries."
"Growler shared by Barry tonight, thanks man."
"Look: Pineapple/orange juice especially after the head fades, which is very quick. Almost no lacing. 2.5"
"On tap at the brewery. Deeply hazy orange-amber pour. Wet green hops in the aroma, some neutral alcohol. Mostly a malt-bomb in the taste, accented by the sticky fruitiness of the hops, and again, some neutral booze. Not really a fan of this one."
This beer was excellent! The floral aromas and tropical fruit flavor made this deceptively strong ale well balanced and easy to drink. This is a perfect after dinner beer and a great way to watch the sunset across Lake Champlain.
"Growler poured into teku at about 4 days. Appearance is hazy, slightly dirty, reddish-orange, with a pure white head that leaves just a little lace. Smell is very aromatic, with citrus and pine. Tatste is also citrus/pine, with just a touch of onion/garlic. Produces very piney burps. Mouth is a good, medium body, but a little harshness on the back of the throat, maybe due to either being ""green"" or maybe a high calcium-sulfate content (just guessing). Overall, another good one from Foam, that might be even better with another week or two on it."
"Pours a golden hue, on the opaque side, but not so much on the Built to Spill side. I get berries at first, but in subsequent sips, I get more and more citrus. Again, a poorly described beer as I definitely don't get passion fruit. It's like a harsher double dry hopped Fort Point. However, the harshness makes it hard to realize until several sips in. It's not bad by any means though."
"Got a pour and a growler at foam last week, it is a world class DIPA, up there with any other VT IPA and honestly, I had 7-8 beers from these guys over the 3 days and all of them were world class"
"Had at the brewery in their fluted snifter, 12 oz pour. Pavement is a luscious New England style DIPA with a creamy yellow body and pillowy white head. What a beaut!"
Serving: Growler (day-old)
"This was the star of the show the evening we spent there, everyone on the patio was talking about it. Beautiful hazy orange, smell of mangos, peaches and citrus, taste follows the nose. Foam is making exceptional beers!"
Consumed from a one-day-old growler on 8/8.
Beautiful orange. Tall head. Nice lacing. Mango and citrus shine in the nose. Tastes super refreshing. More bitter than expected. Nice feel. Coats with a nice acidity.
"got a bottle of this filled at the brewery shortly after the debut tapping!! appearance is a brilliant hazy golden orange with a dense white head, spotty lace left behind. big on the nose with candied tangerine orange, fuzzy peach, citrus zest, mango, bubblegum, pineapple, light pine and wet grass. very fresh smelling bouquet of hops and this awesome medicinal dank zestyness coming through that I really enjoy. taste follows perfectly, orange and mango up front, bready malts, peach, light grapefruit and some piney bitterness on the finish. mouthfeel is probably the least impressive part of this beer, maybe a bit thin. overall im really pleasantly surprised by this beer and I cant believe that this brewery is a five minute walk from my house and until now I was completely unaware.... worth trying for sure!"
"This beer is great for what it is, but almost a little too much for me. The 12% is scary for an IPA. Not sure I like the trend that is going on here. "
"Appearance: Pours like an smoothie, with a thick, cloudy, honey-colored look, capped by an inch of foam; streaks of lacing"
Can thanks to swedes21 - an extreme beer
"Pours a burnt orange hue with notes of orange creamsicle flowing out of the head. Dark, cloudy, lactose-y body. Great stuff. Crushability = 100%"
Can - no date:
"Wow! Straight up orange creamscicle schnapps. This beer looks great, smells great, tastes great, and feels great. My favorite Aslin by far."
Tasty and zesty!
"On tap at Southern Grist. A bright yellow haze with a modest white head. Huge tropical and dank aroma, along with floral honey notes. The taste followed - a big mix of tropical fruit and resin, fairly balanced between the two - along with a honey sweetness that melded well with the alcohol sweetness. Bready malt backbone somewhat masked by the honey. Full bodied. Slightly hot on the finish as expected. Outstanding."
Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
"On draft. Served in a goblet glass. Pours a cloudy and hazy golden yellow body, orange hue, one finger white head, short retention and not much lacing. Smell is caramel, big citrus and grapefruit, mineral, sweet honey and a bit of resin. Flavour is a big, fairly sweet orange and grapefruit, light resin, not much pine, fair bit of caramel and grain sweetness that is nevertheless not overpowering despite the high ABV nature of the brew. Not much alcohol heat to be found, which is nice. Medium body, good carbonation, fairly bitter and sweet yet balanced, without an overwhelming astringency or cloying character to it. Balanced triple IPA, lots of character from both the hops and malt, without one dominating the other. Essentially what I imagine a triple NE IPA to taste like. Very good, not quite great, but that is more related to the style more than anything else."
"Triple Orange Starfish sounds like the ""brand name"" of some acid from the summer of Love. At 12% ABV, i may start seeing trails at any moment! Declared as a triple IPA, there is a lot of hop strength in here, very much of an orange peel taste, and it stays bitter throughout. No sweet kiss of a finish for this guy from Aslin Beer Company. Most of what I'm tasting is hops. Strong, grassy, assertive hops. Hops that grab you by the lapels, slam you into the wall three feet above the floor and shouts, ""I'm hops, dammit."" If Charles Bronson were hops (think Mr. Majestyk rather than the mild nebbish of Death Wish) those would be the ones used here. The color is a strong gold tending toward brown, and is heavily sedimented, or at least lacks ckarity. The bite stays on your tongue for a while after you drink, just to remind you exactly how hop-laden it is. The smell actually isn't that spectacular, has that orangey lrmon-lime, maybe with a hint of apple behind it, but the flavor is nothing short of amazing! and that ABV. I may be glad that I only have one if these, because after this, it is bedtime."
"Pours a dark orange, opaque with a short head. Aroma is orange, peppery, tropical. Upon initial taste you get a decent amount of booze, juicy and dry. At 12%, you notice the ABV, but it's still well made enough to make you think you aren't drinking something that heavy. Enjoyed it."
The beer pours a very nice looking creamy and heavy head that dissipates at a moderate pace and leaves quite a bit around the inside of the glass and a bit on the surface. The beer itself has a good look. It's an opaque dark orange with a light yellowish hue; making it strongly resemble orange juice.
A: not so hazy tang juice color with a mid frothy head. Looks relatively clear comparatively to the standard juice these days
"Tall can, acquired via trade, no canning date info that I can find."
Can shared by Matthew. Thanks man!
"Solid beer with lots of juicy, tropical, and citrus aroma and flavor but the 12% ABV is totally unnecessary. Big and boozy, not quite at the level of DFH 120 Minute, but you can tell it's a really big beer. Interesting and decently well done but not my favorite."
"From a week-old crowler purchased at Dominion Wine and Beer in Falls Church, pours a totally hazy deep orange. Two fingers of foam leave decent lacing--probably the most I've seen at this ABV. Initial smell is tons of oranges (duh). Then assorted tropical fruits, spicy herbs, dank and a bit of pine. Small hit of backing malt. "
16 oz can from 10/28/17 released. Lovingly poured into Aslin 2nd Anniversary glass.
"A- Incredibly hazy, as Aslin IPAs tend to be. Chalky, turbid, etc. The creamy white head settles to a few splotches. Nice lacing."
16oz can poured into a long stemmed goblet
"For an IPA clocking in at 12% my first impression is that is going to be extremely boozy or super bitter (i.e. American Barleywine leaning). I was wrong in both regards. It is a sweet, aromatic hoppy, non-bitter and smooth and waaayyyy too easy to drink for 12%. Goes down like an 8% offering. Quite an amazing triumph for an IPA this big."

"This was yet another beer that I waited in line for at Other Half, dated 10/18 on the bottom with SAILORS' DELIGHT written under it. I enjoyed the regular Citra Daydream but for some odd reason, this wasn't an improvement over the original. As enjoyable as this was, it came across as just a bit too one-dimensional for me but like nearly everything else from these guys, this was still pretty tough to sip slowly!"
"This one pours a light hazy yellow-ish color, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
