"Citra forward (pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine etc), mild bitter finish, it is good but doesn’t really stand out from the crowd though that said it is still quietly very good"
What?!?! This beer is hop magic!
"The stamp is a bit smudged, but it looks like the bottom of the can: says: ""CANNED ON 08/02/18 F4392 09:30"""
Wow isn't that the most meanest & toughest beer can artwork that I have laid eyes on. It looks the part of an IPA. I was expecting more an east coast IPA that had a fair amount of malts to go along with bitter hoppiness that these beers tend to bring to the table. I am a little disappointed in this IPA guys. Well it does taste edgy & bold as what is expected with this type of beer can artwork. Cheers! B-
"Aggressive but good. Citrus aroma, nice color and good Hoppiness. I still have a couple to enjoy."
"There is a reason Beer Connoisseur rated this one so high. I am not big fan of IPA; but this one is excellent! Pours a pale gold with a slight haze and nice head. Lots of interesting aromas - tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Goes down smooth and crisp. Has a nice snap of bitterness at the end, but not offensive or over done. Short aftertaste. If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."
"Tropicalia 12oz can poured int Duvel tuplic. ON 07/11/18, BY 10/09/18 stampd on bottom of can."
Out of a can at Max Lagers poured
"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.
"Poured out of growler 4 days after buying. Nothing fancy here, just a simple but beautifully crafted single hip ipa that checks off all the boxes. Terrific!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
On tap at Grizzly's Plymouth.
"I wish I could post pictures with my reviews. This beer almost glows a stunning orange and the beer tastes as good as it looks. Hazy NE style IPA, so juicy and citrus/fruity. I've had few beers I crave more than this... now if only it could be readily had in the twin cities!!"
My favorite Disgruntled beer. I also love Reaper. Juicy and the perfect hop presence. Every batch is a little different but it is consistently my favorite MN IPA.
I've had this before but never rated it. Always enjoyed it. Looks the part with the cloudy orange juice appearance. Nice fruity aroma which leans toward the tropical fruits but definitely includes citrus fruit notes. Really a nice aroma to this. 
I really liked this one. Some variations in the batches but over all very good!
"This beer pours a completely opaqu dirty yellow with a fairly head. is hugely tropical, with passionfruit, pineapple, grapfruit, tangerine, mango, and guava. The flavor is joyously juicy, with loads of passionfruit, guava, pineappl, and mango, as well as grapefruit peel, kiwi, watermelon, honeydew, and a decent bitter pithy finish. The mouthfeel is quite soft and pillowy, with fulsome carbonation. Overall this beer has a wonderfully descriptive name - it is stupid how good this is. Great texture, huge aroma, gorgeous flavor, and just enough bitterness for balance."
"Look: A dull, cloudy orange appearance."

"LOOKS: A hazy, burnt lemon with a finger of white foam that slowly fades to a ring. Fair lacing down the glass."
Pours out a cloudy straw color. The head is off-white with moderate retention. Lacing is moderate as well.
"Hot shit 3 years ago, not so much now. The competition kicks this beer in the nuts and says fuck you old man."
"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks. "
"Picked up a few dry cases at, wait for it...Total Wine..Huh? yep, Total had 4 cases on hand and I helped myself to all of them. Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can. Hopefully New Zeland will cut loose enough Nelson hops for Beachwood BBQ to put Alpha Supreme back on the menu, we can only hope."
"Bottled 9/5/18, consumed 9/22/18"
Poured into a hybrid glass from a 12oz bottle

"Pours an opaque orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, papaya, and watermelon. Nice tropical fruit aromatics, with light wheaty, biscuity malt notes behind. Flavor profile is grapefruit, papaya, orange, and light mango with light wheaty, biscuity malt notes behind. Big flavor with an aroma to match. Still, it doesn't scream tropical fruits or get right in your face to announce its presence. Good balance here. Mouth feel is lightly grainy, with a fuzzy, dry finish. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a splendid beer with big hop notes in both the aroma and flavor profile, while still allowing malts to peek through. Make no mistake, the hops are the story here though. "
"Looks great and smells fine but compared to DDH Fort Point this is a bit of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Melcher Street, this was the middle of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!"
"Another excellent DDH Street Series IPA. This one is really smooth with excellent hop flavor, though it doesn't explode in the mouth like DDH Farnsworth did for me. The drinkability factor is high due to the mouth-feel. Overall, an excellent mid-ABV IPA that is a pleasure to drink."
Look- Poured aggressively into a Trillium tulip glass. With a two finger head. Picture does not do the color of this beer justice. Its a beautiful opaque and turbid yellow. 4.25
Canned 11 days ago.
Canned 8 days ago. My 50th review of a Trillium beer!
On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of orange and tropical fruit. Tastes of tropical fruit and orange. Very bright. Some pale malt with a touch of sweetness. Low bitterness. Medium body. Good.

"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
An awesome ipa with a full flavor of mosaic hops and an exceptional amount of floral undertone. When you pour it you will smell sunflowers and with the pineapple quenching flavor it adds to an experience any ipa lover will crave.
Best IPA in TX hands down
Strange beer
Made an account just to rate this beer 5/5. Best beer ive had coming out of texas.
Crisp and delicious grapefruit with a pineapple finish. Fruity Mosaic hops all day against a light backbone. Very good IPA.
"Pours a slightly hazy, grapefruit juice color with a big thick head. Much carbonation to be seen. Lacing is good. Has a different aroma in that hoppy smell that I would call, delicious. Has a nice flavor and the hop character comes on the back end. It's got a thin mouthfeel for an IPA and goes down fast and easy. Overall it's nice beer that drinks easy and not overpowering in the hops or the alcohol. It's unfiltered and unpasteurized. Mosaic whole cone hops are used. I would buy this one again. Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle dated 07/03/18 into an Imperial Nonic. It's big enough to share and somewhat pricey. A good starter for the non-IPA folks to try. www.lonepint.com"
16.9oz bottled 7-3-18
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"

This is a review of Project Dank Summer 2018 Edition.
Rich copper/amber color. A good creamy looking head. Nice lacing. Excellent aroma. Hops are inviting. Taste follows the nose and it’s very good and it reminds me so much of Cedar Creeks’ Dankosaurus. Mouthfeel is smooth and the bitterness is just right. This is the one you want at La Cumbre Taproom.
"Thanks to leftpaw for kicking one of these down on a trip. Pours a darker golden color. Solid 3/4"" white head on it with ample retention, especially for a beer with such a high hop/hop oil to it. Those hops aren't the most pungent in the nose, they come off kind of restrained if anything. Present, but not overpowering or even to levels I would appreciate. Went in the direction of pineapple and tangerine mostly."
CAN: Currently #1 on the Top New Mexico beers list. 473ml format. Best before: 09/27/18. Pull-tab can. Bloody fantastic label art.
"A: The beer is slightly hazy yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
One of the best double IPAs I have had.
Clear orange with thick head.

Bottle dated 08/14/18 -- didn't pick it up until 11/02/18 and not opened until the date of this review.
"Skip lunch. Wait for Dinner. This has practically no hops profile by comparison, although it is very smooth."
"Pours a slightly murky yellow/orange with normal carbonation. Aroma is of tropical fruit, juice. Taste is much the same with a hint of malt, not much bitterness. This one really tastes like hawaiin punch without the sweetness. Very well balanced IPA."
"Pours a standard orange with an unfiltered, hazy look that becomes a little more hazy as the lower ounces of the bottle are poured into the glass. Head formation is two fingers of stark white foam, with good retention. Aroma is pine, floral, herbal, and orange. Pine really stands out in this mix, but without an encumbering bitterness it often brings. It's a simple, clean profile. It's not loud and boyish like some other IPAs. Flavor profile has more citrus up front, with pine, herbal, and floral hops falling in behind. Again, well reserved and clean. Toasty, biscuity, wheaty malt notes spring through, firming up the flavor profile and delivering a balanced relationship between hops and malts. Mouth feel is lightly fuzzy and velvety, with a medium consistency, heightening the experience and enjoy-ability. Overall, a balanced and nuanced IPA that doesn't favor hops drastically over malts, and instead utilizes both to form a splendid balance. "
"Lunch is an excellent IPA with a citrusy/piney fragrance that gives way to the same in taste, with the slight pine notes lingering a bit on the palate providing a refreshingly smooth finish. The color is an amber tint with some deep browns and dark oranges. It has fine lacing that cascades quickly down the glass with each sip. It's best enjoyed after it's had a good chill and then a few minutes at room temp before opening, but you knew that."

"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"The appearance was a burnt golden color with a one finger white foamy head that held up for great retention and dissipated at a nice pace into a concave sort of glazing all around. The smell had some sweet danky onion, tropical fruity bliss and as it warmed bitter piney/resinous aromas wrapping together. The taste had the bitterness of the pine coinciding with the tropical fruity hops. Bitter juicy to semi-sprucy aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a good sipping to almost sneaky sessionable feel to it. Carbonation feels good for an AIPA allowing enough bitterness all around. Overall, I’d say this was an exceptional AIPA that I would love to have again."
"Green foiled top bottle (date not found on bottle) poured into large IPA glass. Looks is a hazy copper color with a nice white head that remains, lacing rings the glass when consumed. The smell is lightly fruited with pine notes and subtle caramel malt. The taste is way more malty than the smell, slight oniony notes come through mid palate. The feel through me off, especially for Lawson's! Definitely phenolic harsh bitterness that lingers around and a lighter feel overall. Overall I am disappointed, but hey as a Homebrewer for 9 years I know that some batches are better than others. Cheers."
"It's kind of weird having this next to Sips. To me there was nothing that tropical about this. Floral, piney aroma into a pretty bitter taste. Smooth and well executed, but more on the malty bitter side. More of the solid ipa of yesteryear, meaning this would have played ball in 2012, but now is outclassed by many other tasty ipas"
"This is clearly a beer that did not forget about caramel malt. From the dark orange appearance, through the sweet aroma, to the chewy, smooth body."
"On draft, about a 12oz. snifter at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT."
"World class IPA. Complex hop flavor, easy to drink with a crisp citrus finish."
"Great golden color. The Citra hops are the prominent note here, I think. Splendid."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a white head. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, fresh hops, and light malt. Tastes of very bitter/flavorful/fresh/dank hops, sweet malt, caramel, orange and grapefruit zest, dankness, and light tropical fruits. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible hop bomb."
"Yep, this is a hop bomb, no doubt about it. I didn't look at the IBUs on the bottle, but I'd guess about 100 or so. A check of their website upon writing this review yielded ""A LOT"" in the IBU category, so maybe I'm close. But as advertised, that's what dominates this beer. Good if you like the style."
A bomber with a packed on date sticker on the cap that reads 09/21/17. Pouring in a 12oz. tulip for the review. 
"Hazy gold color. Half-finger head that lingers and laces nicely. Lots going on with the nose. Strong scents of tropical fruit, floral, honeysuckle and mineral. Love the taste of this beer. Very well balanced between the hops and the malt. Strong flavors of pomegranate, pine, grapefruit and peach. Medium body. Nice medium-length finish coats the palate."
"Pours a cloudy gold with decent head and very good lacing. Nose is hoppy citrus with some floral tones and grapefruit. The taste is just awesome, very sweet hoppy goodness with a refreshing citrus mix, a little dry and very mild bite on the finish. I really enjoyed this beer, the hops were so tasty, just a juicy goodness."
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."

10 oz pour at taproom. Good stuff! Blend of hops packed more of a punch than single-hop Half-Light Sunbeam. Upside: lots of flavor. Downside: bitter.
"Poured from a growler purchased 2 hrs ago, into the test glass."
"Draught @ The Foundry: This one pours a murky golden color. There was a small white head that left some lacing. Good nose. Mainly tropical hops. Some citrus too. The taste was very good. Not too much bitterness, but lots of jucy hops. Tropical and citrus flavors. Nice!"
"Had this on tap at the Foundry. The beer had a cloudy, dark orange appearance with a medium thick head that lasted awhile. Aromas were sharp with very vocal orangepeel mixed with various citrus smells and piney hops, Taste followed the nose with a very citrus-y, tangy, and juicy drink that did not overpower the flavor senses. Very easy to drink with my meal at the bar. Mouthfeel was interestingly silky in texture with a light, refreshing body. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this beer; appearance, aromas, and flavors were awesome."
West coast meets East coast... Awesome beer!!!!
"Drank on tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

"Heist kills it once again. Ive had this beer the last four times they canned it. Never disappoints,murky orange color. Tastes like OJ but 10x better! I live in East Charlotte and there are plenty of breweries trying to do this hazy ipa thing. Heist is on point 100%"
"Can dated 8/7/18! Drank this one exactly one month later! Looks like murky hop juice. Smells and tastes like just what they were going for berry dank juice! The feel is soft and velvety. Overall delicious, I want another!!"
From the can: 
"Pours an opaque pale orangish-yellow with a finger and a half of stark white foam on top. Head retention is good with a few dense strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is mango, papaya, tangerine, orange, and light biscuit malts. Aroma is huge and flavorful with a splendid collection of tropical fruit and citrus aromas. Flavor profile is mango, papaya, melon, pineapple, tangerine, and clementine. It has a light backbone of biscuit malts. Mouth feel is a little chalky and grainy with a fine fizziness. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a delightfully aromatic and flavorful IPA. Not much perceivable bitterness, just dense notes of sugary citrus. "
"Pour is hazy yellow. Tall, fluffy, Whitehead the Fades slowly to a rocky head with good lacing."
Appearance - Pours cloudy light yellow with a big fluffy white head nice amount of lacing.

"Has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. I was quite excited, as I love the style, the ratings are high and this is the first time I saw this sold in Toronto."
I like I like
"At $2.64 per 12 oz bottle I had expected a very good product and it was very good; however, was it exceptional for the value? It certainly was flavorful; however, it was not hoppy like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which I do like. (Not associated.) It had very good taste, a very good feel and smell but that extra hoppiness that one expects with a craft brewed IPA just was not there. It was certainly worth buying to try and I may even buy some more in the future but I think I'll have to wait for it to be on sale."
"Used to be good. Sold out. Cranking them out ad nauseum. Now just a shelf turd, 15 months after bottle date."

"Smooth delicious IPA. Many tropical notes, not too hoppy or overpowering. Slightly sweet from the fruity flavors."
"Appearance: bright golden color (think macro pilsener) with very slight haze – not NE IPA-style, more like a slight chill haze. The head forms a ½-finger of off-white with fair retention."
My standard go-to semi-premium IPA
"Have had this beer multiple times from both a can and from a tap. The pour results in a cloudy dark-orange/amber look with a thick off white head. The smell is strong and features a plethora of fruits, mostly citrus and light. Taste is reflective of the smell with a citrus hop flavor that has a slight bitterness. Mouth feel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall, it is fruity but in a refreshing way and not sour. There is still some bitterness and hops present. This is one of my favorite IPA's."
"Got in a BIF from KMitch. 12 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carrbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.6%. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish, not overly aggressive. Not as intensely tropical/juicy as I expected, but rather old school feeling IPA. Nice Centennial, Galaxy, and Citra profile. Centennial seems to have the most presence. Very juicy, dank, and earthy balanced hop complexity; nice bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example. No real complaints."
"Bought this at Trader Joe's. Checkout lady said they couldn't keep it in stock. I'm on the hunt for local beers that kick ass, and this beer has been highly rated."
Damn fine beer here. To the specifics....

"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

Tap to pint glass @ Russian River Brewing tap 
Jeez this beer is always awesome.
"On tap at the source. Poured into a pint glass at happy hour for $3.75, a light golden color with a one-inch thick white head which lingers long. Aroma is floral and bright citrus. Flavor is clean and very hop forward. Bitter finish. Packs quite a hop punch. Easy drinking. Seek this out."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
Goofy can but I had to try having enjoyed other beers from this brewery. Glad to see this in Wegmans in southeastern PA. Picked up a 4 pack for $11. Enjoyed one from the can with pizza on a hot summer day. Thought it was delicious. Glad I have three more. Great citrus and pine scent and taste is clearly Citra with nice bitterness. I detect a grape flavor and found it easy to drink. Another winner from Half Acre. Date on can 5/23/18. Enjoying on the east coast in easy July. Love it.
Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 6/11/18; into a pub glass.
Never thought I’d dislike a Half Acre beer... but there’s a first for everything. 
"Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a white head. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, fresh hops, and light malt. Tastes of very bitter/flavorful/fresh/dank hops, sweet malt, caramel, orange and grapefruit zest, dankness, and light tropical fruits. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible hop bomb."
"Yep, this is a hop bomb, no doubt about it. I didn't look at the IBUs on the bottle, but I'd guess about 100 or so. A check of their website upon writing this review yielded ""A LOT"" in the IBU category, so maybe I'm close. But as advertised, that's what dominates this beer. Good if you like the style."
A bomber with a packed on date sticker on the cap that reads 09/21/17. Pouring in a 12oz. tulip for the review. 
"Hazy gold color. Half-finger head that lingers and laces nicely. Lots going on with the nose. Strong scents of tropical fruit, floral, honeysuckle and mineral. Love the taste of this beer. Very well balanced between the hops and the malt. Strong flavors of pomegranate, pine, grapefruit and peach. Medium body. Nice medium-length finish coats the palate."
"Pours a cloudy gold with decent head and very good lacing. Nose is hoppy citrus with some floral tones and grapefruit. The taste is just awesome, very sweet hoppy goodness with a refreshing citrus mix, a little dry and very mild bite on the finish. I really enjoyed this beer, the hops were so tasty, just a juicy goodness."

had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.

This is the best beer ive ever had. Perfect amount of citrus and mouthfeel. ABV is a perfect amount for me as I find beers over 7% to be boozy and not enjoyable to actually drink. DEAR CALUSA - make this your flagship and not focus. Much more drinkable and flavorful!
Hazy though not as hazy as Focus.
Hazy IPA packed with citrus and hops. Juice bomb!
"On-tap at Caluso Brewing, Sarasota, FL"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

"Had on tap at PCBP. Excellent beer. Full NEIPA flavor (Citra and Mosaic in this case) with all th juiciness and citrus. Unsure but Vermont yeast seems to really bring it all together. Big malt backbone. A little bright on the carbonation, but I just like my beers closer to foam natural carbonation."
"Dank and delicious. Look is mostly clear with not a ton of lacing, but everything else about this beer is incredible. I drank this after Mass Riot and they are very different beers but equally delicious."
"This beer pours a golden orange amber color with a two finger, foamy white head. Retention is great as I had a one finger cap for the duration of the beer."
One of the best beers I have had in a while. Ben (the brewer at PC) continues to create outstanding beers. This may be his best yet.
"L - A mixture of dull orange and bright yellow. Not quite straw but the color of freshly blended bananas. Unfiltered, turbid, hazy etc etc. No light passes through. Completely opaque. Frothy white head."
"Pours a foggy golden. Good aromatics. A great combo of tropical fruit and grapefruit. A little bit of bite, but no burn like hoppy beers on the old profile have seemed to have."
Excellent beer in all phases. Tastes and smells like original Pseudo Sue when it was growler only on draft in Decorah. Similar full on citra hop profile. Refreshing but full bodied IPA. Huge citrus nose with a hint of melon.
Really hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma has sweet vanilla notes and juicy hops. Taste is sweet and hoppy with juicy tropical notes and low bitterness.

"A lighter, let’s say, summer version of PtE that’s cut from the same cloth. Absolutely worth the effort to try."
Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco. Purchase to contrast with Pliny the Elder.
Shimmering burnt gold with a thick off-white foam that leaves drooping curtains of lace all over the glass.
"Bottled today, classic 510ml bottle."
This is about the most traditional/classic west coast IPA as one can find. Piney and Floral and a moderate to heavy bitter finish. A little to heavy on the pine and bitterness for me but I respect this for a very well made beer.

Bottle shared by Sylvain.
I've heard great things...now I've tasted them. 
Pours a deep golden with whitish frothy two finger head. Aroma is slightly tropical but heavier to pine and grass. Flavour starts with a hint of sweetness then moves to earthy pine and grass notes. Hop bite up front is assertive but not off putting. Finishes with an earthy chewy dryness.
"This review is one of two fresh hop ale reviews - the other being Yellow Dog Brewery’s Alpha Dog 2106 release. I made these reviews as a challenge by an acquaintance who said that Alpha Dog was a way better beer than Driftwood’s Sartori Harvest. As I have not had the privilege to try either until now, I figured a good head to head taste off was in order (pun intended). See here (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35919/193023/?ba=JonCorbett#review) for my review of Alpha Dog. "
Got on a CANBIF trade! Thx westcoastbeergeek! Served at 4deg C in a draught glass
Package: 650 ml bottle.
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

Headed back for 1 more fight before making the trip back to FL.
Holy mackerel. Massive hops without destroying my tongue.
Appearance: Amber with very light haziness.
"Light hop haze with huge citrusy, fruity aroma. Very tasty IPA. Get some malt base with massive hop flavors. A tiny bit drier than expected, but overall a very fine IPA."
"In my unprofessional opinion the Acerbic is the epitome of what an American IPA should be. The Nose, Mouthfeel, Taste, Color, Head Retention and Mouthfeel are perfect."
"Acerbic is my go to when visiting Broomtail. It has been a super consistent great tasting IPA. It has a nice dark gold almost amber color. Darker than most IPA's I've had but the body is well balanced and mouthfeel is just right when the hops hit your nostrils and tongue. If you like a hearty hoppy IPA, this unique beer performs a good balancing act. The only ""negative"" is you have to be careful about how easily these go down."
Aroma: The beer has a very mild to strong presence of hops aroma.
The best IPA I have ever had. The hop profile is perfectly crafted to leave your palate with an amazing taste but does not overwhelm you. Each sip beckons your for another. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. The definition of a craft IPA.
Had this at the brewery. Pours nice filtered amber color with a small head. Had a nice malt backbone and not much hop bitterness. A definite English style IPA. Good but just another IPA. Nothing special about this.
"My favorite IPA. Drinkable, huge aroma and flavor, but almost no juicy haze."
"Had on tap. It tastes good, don't get me wrong, but it falls short for me as an ipa. Not nearly enough hop character in the taste or in the body. Good amount of malt and sweet finish than usual. Again tasty, but rated as an ipa it isn't complete enough"

"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "

"The Hop Shop that forms a line for extraterrestrial home brewers pours a laser beam yellow, whatever the hell that means. Brunch orange juice cocktail perhaps? It's yellowy orange and beautiful with a wispy white foam that leaves a fine film of bubbles wherever it has made contact."
16 oz can
"World class. This is in the same conversation as green, Julius and trilliums IPAs. Big notes of tropical fruit. Medium mouthfeel. Full haze. World class IPA"
"Being a big fan of Chuck's Hop Shop, I've wanted to get my hands on one of these for a while. Luckily, I had a friend visit from Seattle, that works there. My can was well over a month old, but was still juicy and hoppy. I'd love to try one that was fresher, I'm sure it would be even better."
"Really hazy yellow color with creamy, off-white head. Aroma is really hoppy with nice pineapple and mango juice but also some dank and grassy notes. Taste has tons of hops, dank, grassy, chives, hop resin, medium bitterness. Medium body with a really smooth mouthfeel. Awesome IPA, up there with the New England juice bombs."

"Definitely one of the better Lawson's bottles that I've had. Not quite at the same level as Double and Triple Sunshine, but I'd say its right at the same level as SoS, but quite different."
This was an awesome beer. I 1st had it on tap at the Lawson's event (was the best beer I had there) and again last night when opened of the my bottles from the event. Definately in the same tier as SOS and the rest of the bigger IPAs! Well done!

Hazy pale yellow with a thick white foam dome leaving peaks of lace.
Appearance - Pours bright yellow with big light fluffy white head that dissipates to about a one inch cap and stays. Spotty lacing all around the glass.
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Very nice citrus aroma. Mainly orange. Mild piney resin. Somewhat juicy. Taste does still have some juicy orange, but it is definitely off at the end. A little more bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Still a good beer."
Round 2 with Parish! This was bottled on 11/2/17.

chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
Hazy NEIPA. A bit more pine and bitterness with a less pillowy mouthfeel than the very best NEIPAs but this is still an excellent beer which I would gladly drink any time - and an argument could be made that the pine/bitterness makes this even better than a straight-up OJ NEIPA.
"awesome that my buddy was able to send a crowler of this out to me fresh from the brewery. its a beer i have been wanting to try since i first heard about it, and we cracked into it with much enthusiasm. it is plenty hazy, thats for sure, murky and thick, not particularly bright, but with gorgeous carbonation rising into a tall white head that holds well and leaves frothy lacing as it drinks down. the aroma is awesome, leafy vegetal and fresh, loaded with hops, almost at a max out point, really saturated and intense, heavily dry hopped and not at all unfamiliar to me. citra dominated, at least to me, in the aroma, lemon curd and zest, with some heftier hops in here too, simcoe perhaps, grapefruity with a pine aromatic, notes of confectioners sugar, white wheat earthiness grounding, mouthwatering but not so unique as i thought it would be for all of its acclaim. this is definitely citra driven, but i get more bitterness than i usually do from citra alone, i like that in an ipa like this, its needed, the juiciness is there, fresh and insanely dry hoppy, but the bitter side is welcomed here. fresh spruce, tangerine, oats and wheat for sure in the mash, oily too. i like how creamy this is in the feel, it supports the hops nicely and makes me think the haze is more of a natural thing than something contrived here, i like this kind of grain base in such a dry hopped beer, its needed. in the end, this was awesome, we all really liked it, but i wanted it to be more different than it is. this tastes like a whole lot of others right now, which i guess was a bit of a let down for me, it was memorable for quality but not for its flavor in any way, if that makes sense. better then most of the field in this category of ipa..."
"Let me just say, i almost cried when i had this beer. Its so delicious, so interesting, and has such a great hoopy taste. I would buy this en masse if i could, but its only sold at the pub. 10/10 flavor"
"Definitely has that NE haze. The aromas and flavors of mango, pineapple and faint passion fruit deliver on that expected juice bomb character. Seemed slightly green still, bet this would be better with another week or so on it."
"From a Crowler (12/18/16) poured into a tulip. Opened during a tasting of 4 different IPAs. This was the second to be tasted. Certainly looks the part of a hazy NEIPA, and smells of one, too. It pours a light amber color with a very deep haze. Decent head retention. The tropical aromas are there, but there's also a noticeable smell of malt/wheat bread. The taste is where this beer loses me compared to other NEIPAs - I'm guessing it's the yeast strain, but it picks up some of the fruity esters I would associate with a Kolsch. There's very little bitterness here... it's almost like a sparkling fruit juice or shandy, but with the faintest hint of pine to remind you it may be an IPA. The body is great - medium with good carbonation. Virtually zero dryness on the finish."
"I have been lucky enough to have had each of the releases, from the original to last week (yes the wait in lines is worth it). It may be me but each batch seems to get better. Hopefully with the expansion Mass Riot will be on year round or at least in a rotation with the Vermont Riot."
"32 oz. crowler. Very hazy orange. Smells of citrus, tropical fruits, and garlic hops. Doesn't smell sweet, but you can smell the oat additions. Tastes very much of oats as well. It's the dominant grain flavor. Orange hops with a strong garlic bite in the back end. Medium body. The oats give it some heft without sweetness. Almost has the body of a double IPA. Impressive."
A: Hazy pale orange in color

Canned 4/11/18. I’m very happy to finally get my hands on some cans of Party Wave from the brewery without having to wait in a line. Kudos to Kane for really making their brewey experience smooth and effecient (worth noting I didn’t go on a release day). 
Decanted from a 16 oz (355 ml) can into a Kane snifter; canned on 04/11/18 and purchased at the brewery.

Pours a beautiful orange yellow but very little head. 
"Hazy lemon drop/orange juice color with a furry, creamy, thick head of 2 fingers. Lots of lace behind. "
"Bought a 4-pack at the Congress Street brewery location. This beer has a very thick, dark orange appearance with a medium head that does dissipate with some patchy lacing. Aromas include some thick citrus hops with orangepeel and lemon. The taste follows the nose but is more vocal than the aromas. Tastes like carbonated, lightly boozy, orange juice. The mouthfeel is really good. Not too refreshing, but nothing overpowering; good carbonated body. Overall, this was fantastic, especially with its appearance and mouthfeel."
Nelson all over.
"There is a reason Beer Connoisseur rated this one so high. I am not big fan of IPA; but this one is excellent! Pours a pale gold with a slight haze and nice head. Lots of interesting aromas - tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Goes down smooth and crisp. Has a nice snap of bitterness at the end, but not offensive or over done. Short aftertaste. If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."

Out of a can at Max Lagers poured
"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.
"A: Ample hop aromas of citrus and tropical fruit, coupled with white grape."
"Pours a very hazy orange with a white head. Smells of oranges, tropical fruits, and hops. Tastes of sweet papaya, mango, orange zest, grapefruit, hops, light malt, and other fruits. Medium creamy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible NEIPA."
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy and cloudy golden yellow body with a slight orange hue. One finger white head, plenty of retention, bits of lacing on the opposite side of the glass as I drink. Smell is pineapple juice, grapefruit and citrus, a bit of sweet caramel though not too much, a little wheat germ. Flavour has a bit less of the pineapple juice quality but a more balanced light caramel with grapefruit and citrus hop aromatics, light resinous bitterness that isn't too distracting from the aforementioned hop aromatics. Not too sweet either. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, dangerously drinkable with a lighter-medium bitterness to it. Super tasty IPA."
"Just visited San Diego and picked up a 4 pack of this from their brewery. Drove it back today 9.5 hours back to Chico and cracked this one as a night cap. Smells phenomenal. Rain pouring out my window while I sip on this one with some nice background music. Also looks to be a Garage Project collab which is awesome. Super juicy, tons of citrus, but not overbearingly sweet. Poured completely hazy same color as a ripe persimmon. Glad I picked these up, cheers!"
"Received 2 cans from the great ScottO to try out. In that same package was a bottle of Citra from Kern. The Citra was a little over a week or 2 old, and in all honesty, I did not look at the relative age of the Blam Blam, but it blew Citra out of the water hands down. A brighter pour, great citrus nose, which is echoed in the flavor. A little bitter on the end, but it is an IPA. Fantastic beer."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
"16 oz can, purchased a few hours ago from the source in Beacon, NY....11/6/18 caning date."
Decanted from a 32 oz crowler into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/14/2018.
"Drank on tap at Hudson Valley Brewery, Beacon, NY"
"Wow! Like a Ninja Turtle on DMT, this one is unique! Sour and hoppy all together! It's like a SI model moonlighting as your uber driver - I like that!"
"Nice sour IPA looks that leaves good spotty lacing, but the star of the show is the nose: smells of tangerine, grapefruit, peppery spices, tea leaf, orange peel, chamomile, toasted grains, yeast, floral notes and light cinnamon and/or potpourri that somehow works as a nice sour IPA. I’m not normally a fan of intense spices nor the extra floral notes mixed with potpourri like chamomile, but this works with the sour/tart IPA citrus notes. Crazy combo that somehow works well."
Is it me or is there an underlying hint of nutmeg to the tropical fruits. Delicious. Thanks Steve!
A 12 ounce can poured into a IPA glass.
Just amazing beer
"I'm very picky when it comes to IPAs – it's all too easy to make a hoppy mess! – but Sculpin is one of the most consistently satisfying I've had the pleasure of drinking. When I'm not in a mood to experiment, it's my go-to IPA."
"This is an excellent IPA! First had it with Julia in California, maybe Carlsbad, at a bar that had just okay food but it had this beer on tap, and I remembered it. Able to get it in bottles at Elkton, hooray!"
"L - hazy, opaque golden with a medium off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind a good amount of lacing. "
"It pours a bit hazy golden color with a small head. The smell is of citrus but not very much almost no smell at all. The taste is tropical fruit, grapefruit and maybe mango. Overall a nice IPA just not great."
"From an IPA ""hater""......this is good! Great even! I got the Aloha ""tropical"" version of this yesterday and it was too bitter/hoppy for me. THIS is what I was hoping for yesterday: peach, pear and grapefruit taste in that order. Make sure to get thos on the bottom of your tounge--that's my favorite part of this taste. Brings out the pear more, somewhat similar to a Belgian beer. Ya, looks nice in a glass too. Bitterness is balanced against the fruit perfectly for my taste. San Diego makin me proud again with this one."
"I was looking forward to trying this one based on the many positive reviews, but it's just not for me. I prefer a standard, straightforward hoppy IPA (floral notes are a bonus), and this one registered as just another juice bomb. Try it for yourself."
"Another winner from Kane, NJ's best brewery IMO. Head High is a wonderful beer and this continues that. So juicy with citrus notes while also being well balanced and smooth. Excellent beer."
"Thanks to The Terminator, SadMachine, for this 500ML bottle. "

Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"Peach golden color with a thick white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Notes of fresh squeezed lemon and lime, citrus zest, grapefruit, tangerine, touch of black peppercorn and a candied herbal sweetness. Carbonation seems spot on refreshing, crushable, light medium body, slightly dry and soft on the palate. This is a fantastic, zippy and even slightly tart, juicy, hop bomb of an IPA. Blew me away."
L: Hazy and cloudy peach/golden orange body replete with a fluffy white head and ample lacing
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
64oz growler thanks to airfoil. Served in HF tulip.
"Pours a crystal clear, deep golden color with a rapidly dissipating off-white head that gets perpetually fed by carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sweet grapefruit nose is so inviting. Full body that enters the mouth so smoothly you'd think it was nitrogen. Lovely citrus through and through without overpowering. This IPA has nice balance."
A- Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some nice spotty lacing. 
Growler into tulip pint.

"Not much smell, but the look is bar none awesome. Nice lace on the glass, just the right head and a deep rich amber. However, I drink beer for the taste not the look. Yes taste is a 4 and I would like to try this on draft, but it could use a little more malt backbone."
Only downside: available only in NM and CO
"Nice copper color beer. Not much head but good lacing. Better hop aroma. And good hoppy taste. Mouthfeel is a good balance of hops that’s not too bitter. Overall it’s a very good IPA and I’m glad I got a 4 pack to take home, based on BA ratings. Canned 09/06/18"
1 pint can:
"I picked up a four pack of tall boys for a camping trip to Guadalupe Mountains national park earlier this week. This is a big, aggressive brew with high bitterness and a heavy citrus and herbal hop lean. The finish is juicy and puckers the lips a bit. I would definitely take this camping again if given the chance."
"Elevated is a beautiful looking beer. The brightly polished copper color is familiar and inviting, and the foamy eggshell white pillow above is comforting. The patches and rings of lace are the impressive marks of a professional."
"The beer to bring back from a trip to northern New Mexico. I pour most of the 16 oz can into a chilled tall mug, see a nice yellow-orange body with enough head to keep track of the sips. Hoppy, of course, strongly so. I detect lemon, grass and a bit of sweetness at the end. The taste and bitterness linger. Should be the first beer of a session before you move on to lesser brews, just make the four pack last."
"August 19th, 2015 - Cumbre's Get Elevated IPA is a solidly median IPA, neither good nor bad, but with a hop profile that is boring on its own but fits a meal very nicely. The aroma is generically hoppy and reminds me of old school pale ales, neither sweet nor grapefruity. The flavor is flattish but the palate is fine. Nice and buoyant, it has a sharp hop profile that lasts a long way through the aftertaste, but is both a little direct and metallic."
"Can at Brixens, Albuquerque, NM"
"Pours clear copper with a medium white head. Aroma brings out fresh piney hop character and a dry biscuity malt backing. Flavor is clean, with tons of piney hops, citrus, and biscuity malt. Piney and dry, with a wonderfully oily palate. Sharp dry and bitter finish."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"32oz crowler, filled on 8.31.18, poured into a Corridor Bicycle pint glass."
"Crowler from the brewery, poured into a snifter. This checks all the boxes for a NE IPA. Low bitterness, creamy mouthfeel, orange yellow color. Nose and taste are orange, and apricot candy with maybe a little bit of tart fruit at the end."
"Sample from the brewery. This beer's soft, opaque, matte orange color screams NEIPA, while a cloudlike head that just won't quit gives Cosmic Juice Box appearance points lacking from many of its less accomplished peers. Meanwhile, deep orange notes, whispers of apricot, prominent pine, lemon candy, and waves of passion fruit make this one worth an extra sniff or two. Some solvent-y alcohol also shows up as the drink warms in the glass. Although full-bodied, Corridor has made an IPA with balance and bitterness, which enhances its drinkability. Lots of citrus, a bit of resin, toasted sourdough, and a semi-dry finish distinguish the flavor. Well executed and extremely likeable."
"Crowler from a friend. I thought this was super nice. The aroma is stellar, huge dry hop fruity ness, very juicy. The body is on the heavier side, a touch sweet for my taste, but nice hop flavor. Solid effort"
"Tasted in a snifter from draft at Corridor Brewery & Provisions on December 8, 2017. Thick hazy IPA brewed with Citra, Mosaic, and double dry hopped with tons of Galaxy. Recommended."
Crowler filled 9/23/17; drank 9/24/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Poured from a crowler less than a day old off the draft line. The appearance is muddled orange, like an unfiltered mango or peach juice. Made with galaxy, citra, and mosaic hops, but really a showcase for the galaxy--pineapple, passion fruit, and mango on the nose, tangerine added on the palate. A bit of bittering hop character throughout the experience, so not a total juice bomb, but it's better off for that added complexity."
"Another home run from Corridor! It has their expected soft, pillowy mouth feel without feeling un-carbed. Very juicy, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors exploding out of the glass."
Hazy opaque orange with a thin layer of foam and spotty lace. 
"A bit more bitter than say... Double Sunshine, but great hop flavor. And a lovely mouthfeel. I think it's not so much that it's more bitter, as it has less of the citrusy complimentary flavor."
they cant all be home runs. This is a solid double to left....
Canned two weeks ago.
"16 oz. can. Hazy orange. Smells of orange and, since I just read the description and it says peach, I smell peach juice. The vaguest hint of toasted malt that I remember from the regular version. Tastes of orange and that same sweet peach flavor. Both flavors push well into the back end, though some toasted malt and a slight grapefruit bitterness come through. Medium body with low carbonation. I remember the regular version being quite different from other Trillium IPAs. This is not different, though complaining would be unfair, as it is still very good."
"Dated 5/14/18 on the bottom of the can, 9 days since brewing."
Lovely.
"Pours a cloudy yellow gold with thick head and lacing. Nose is very sweet, citrus, malt, hops, floral. Flavors match the nose, very nice peach notes with some orange, floral jumping in with a malt finish. Slight bitterness also, this is a fantastic IPA, very balanced and loaded with flavor, ultra smooth."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"Nice resinous bite, good grapefruit and caramel with a bit of biscuit. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, nice resinous and leafy bite on the backend. Another solid IPA from Fat Head's."
"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. Lovely appearance: slightly hazy, light amber in color, three-finger white head, lots of pretty lacing. Big blast of hoppy aroma upon opening the bottle. Poured cold, the hops dominated the aroma and flavor profiles. Lots of dank, juicy pine and citrus, lots of zesty and resiny bitterness. Once it starts to warm a bit, the balance becomes apparent. Good malt structure that provides a little sweetness while allowing the hops to shine. Clean finish, well-hidden ABV. Great beer with food, too."
Found at a reputable beer store in Cleveland but should have checked the date. This was from early October so I don't feel this was the best. Overall pretty okay. Definitely need to try one of these fresh.
On draft in pint glass. darker color than expected. head lasted a while. smell is straight bitter hops. Taste is NE style IPA without any citrus. Great beer that i will watch for in future

"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
Drinking on tap at the facility right now. Beautiful pour with a great head. Great smell. Mosaic hop bomb! If this was from New England it would be top 250. Easily.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma is sweet and fruity with dextrin malt notes and slightly sweaty and dank hops. Taste has sweet vanilla notes and juicy hops with medium bitterness."
Pours hazy orange with a pillowy head.
16 oz. can dated 4/28/18 purchased at brewery and poured into Belgian ale glass.
"Pours a very dense, hazy orange juice color. I have never seen a beer with this lever of haze / turbidity. It seems to glow. Nose is very, very faint grapefruit. Very flavorful for 6.6% abv. Lots of citrus flavors here - grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, subtle peach and mango. Excellent carbonation lens to a creamy mouth feel. Overall this beer is a very flavorful IPA, could easily drink a few of these in one session, but for $20 a 4-pack this is a bit on the expensive side."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the brewery on 10/7/17. Review copied from notes. Poured into an 8oz glass, Mosaic Punch is a turbid orange color with a fluffy white head. Juicy tropical hop aromas of pineapple and grapefruit. Beautifully complex hop profile, the mosaic hop truly proves its name by giving up notes of peach, mango and orange. Slightly dry finish. What a delightful beer. Kane just keeps getting better and better."
"I had this on draught at a restaurant. 16 oz. pour served in a shaker glass. It pours a turbid, brown-gold color with a finger of fluffy, bright white head and lacing that coated the glass for the entire pour. It's a tropical fruit bomb with fragrant mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, pine needles, and light floral hops. The taste is out of this world! It opens with lemon peel and sweet pineapple, mango, and a hint of vanilla, then closes with dank Mosaic, Citra, and Galaxy hops, and lightly-astringent pepper. Every flavor is unique but they blend seamlessly. The mouth feel is equally impressive: silky and creamy with pleasant carbonation. The 6.6% ABV seems just right: it provides substance without being distracting. Overall, this ale is a tour de force. It's hard to imagine how to improve it."
Bright hazy yellow. A little bit of head lingers throughout. Huge nose on this. Massive tropical fruit. Taste follows suit. Berries in there as well. A bit of bitterness. Feel is right where it should be. A nice chew. My only complaint is that this beer just completely falls off on the back end. I guess that could be seen as a good thing. Makes you go back for more. But I just wish it had a bit more on the finish to round it out a bit better. But this is really great stuff.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
Pours hazy golden. Orange and tangerine on the nose. It's got good creamy galaxy citrus character with only a little bit of the bite that comes from raw vegetal galaxy.
"Great color, lovely head. Smells like sweet, creamy Galaxy. Flavor hits the same notes with smooth, fluffy layers of Galaxy; sweet citrus, a little grapefruit, and something I'd describe as a vanilla biscuit/cookie. This beer is a thing of beauty."
"Typical hazy Trillium body. A hint more golden in hue. Smell is melon, tropical fruit, and citrus. Tropical fruit forward flavor with passion fruit and mango. Backing bitterness for balance. Little astringent on the finish."
L - goddamn they are really ripping through these things since starting the Permutation series. Can crack revealed the most appetizing head layer I've seen in some time. Juicy and frothy and full. Galaxy-tinted pineapple haze. 
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"

On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
"This IPA has a nutty start w a crisper finish than a lot of IPAs, also it gets me drunk so yeah...drink up princess!"
"Golden, and cloudy in a crisp sort of way. Moderately carbonated, with two fingers of off-white head. "
"The feel and look of this one are world class. Juicy, watery, round mouthfeel and transitions from cloudy gold to glassy gold in the mug. Taste is simple IPA but very well done orange peel and lemon with some malt background. A+ stuff from Alpine. BTW, Alpine is a nice hilly community in San Diego for those that don't know. I'm impressed that that small community that has so few stores and looks like the Wild West with one old school Western street can produce this!"
Loved it when I first had it but the last few times I just felt it was boring. Surely a classic but not keeping my interest. 
"pours with a yellow/golden color; the smell is very citrusy, hops and pine. Taste is wonderful balance of the hops, citrus (grapefruit; tropical fruit); some malts and a bit of hops bitterness at the end. The feel is crisp and clean. Awesome beer."
"Pours a hazed copper color with a compact, frothy cap. Simcoe fruitiness mingles with cookie dough malts in the nose. Citrusy, peach, melon hops abound in the taste. A solid, clean pale malt ballast keeps things in check. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. Tons of floral, fruity hops in the everlasting finish."
Clean citrusy and piney amber ipa. This west coast ale has a certain bitterness. It's crisp and drinkable but the mouthfeel could be improved. Some herbal notes. I was hoping for something a bit more complex
"This is currently one of my favorite California IPAs. From the first pour, the smell wafts up and darn near makes me salivate thinking about the first sip. For an IPA this is crisp and clean, really nicely hopped, with hints of citrus and pine. The malt which I tend to dislike, is nicely covered by complex flavor. The lacing on the glass, and the finish which lingers perfectly without change makes this a great beer. I have done several blind tastings flights of California IPAs, and it is almost shocking how the Duet makes the following IPAs taste flat and boring (or how I imagine dishwater would taste). At 7% it is right at my sweet spot."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."

"5 oz pour at Cleveland Fat Head’s. Clear pale amber pour with white head. Aroma is distinctly piney, grapefruit, citrus with caramel notes - smells very inviting - screams drink me. Taste is hoppy pine, pineapple and citrus bitter sweetness; bitterness carries the day - but so well balanced with the sweet malt. Medium full mouthfeel - finishes with a delicious lingering happiness. A beer that I could drink every day and be perfectly happy."
"Golden hued body with a fine foamy head; bits of lacing clinging to the glass. Spicy, herbal and pine aroma. Crystal malt base (it seems like) with a spicy, peppery hop taste; very bitter. Medium body; dry and prickly on the palate."
"Today is the occasion of New Fat Rusty Head Rail Sunday (Week 714) & while we just began receiving distro of Fat Head's beers, we do not get the full oeuvre as yet. This will be my last from them for today, but it will be a glorious exit! This is not only one of their flagships but also one of my faves, both from them & in general. "
"My first from Fat Heads, so I went on their website. A successful family business 25 years old and now full of friends and admirers as customers. So who am I to pan their cash cow? I won't."
"The first sip and smell are a little off, but it gets great."
"And old school DIPA, juicy and bitter. With a clean malt bill, and at almost 8% it’s extremely drinkable. Citrus and pine dominate with hop bitterness on the finish. Awesome!"
"Again, another brewery JUST coming to this god forsaken land of Western New York. So late to the game, but now that it’s here...wow! Fresh growler tap, poured chilled aggressively to a tulip glass. In hindsight, a moderate to slow pour is in order, as this has some lively carbonation. Huge white foamy head that dissipates to a bubbling hot tub sizzle. Nose is immensely fragrant citrus and pine, sensed easily from two feet away. Clear amber, with tons of carbonation deep from the bottom...reminds me of PtE’s bubble pattern. Pause for Pliny respect...oh, I’d have to drive to Philadelphia to get another one...damn you Russian River with your spartan distro! First sips are all juicy, piney, grassy, hoppy bright tones. Totally balanced by a semisweet malt back end, that is dark like a hoarhound. Mouthfeel is just above thin, but stays full with a lingering hoppiness. Alcohol is in the above average range, but the crispness and flavor put it in the crushable range. I’ve seen reviews that this will fade fast, but one doesn’t expect a juicy IPA to live long, right? I could see this as a summer staple while I bide time for stout season!"
"Pours golden clear, appropriate foamy head. Aroma is faint - dank and hoppy. Very hoppy flavor - plenty of bitterness, piney hops. Carbonation is on point. I remember this beer a bit bolder: that being said, this beer is 2 months old. I will revisit with a fresher beer in the future. Several years ago, before the explosion of breweries, this was my go to beer. My palate may have shifted to the New England style of IPA.. This still a great west coast IPA."
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
64oz growler thanks to airfoil. Served in HF tulip.
"Pours a crystal clear, deep golden color with a rapidly dissipating off-white head that gets perpetually fed by carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sweet grapefruit nose is so inviting. Full body that enters the mouth so smoothly you'd think it was nitrogen. Lovely citrus through and through without overpowering. This IPA has nice balance."
A- Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some nice spotty lacing.

"Right after the can opening, you can smell a nice tropical smell waving to your nostrils from afar."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

L: Pours a clear golden orange with a small white head and a few fingers of sticky lacing around the glass.
"On tap. Poured a clear, golden-yellow color with a small, white head of bubbly foam. It smelled of grapefruit, pineapple, mango and caramel. Nice tropical fruit taste with a great bitter bite."
Another beer on my radar found during my Portland trip.
"Aroma and taste are both bursting with huge citrus flavors--sweet oranges, clementines are the first to draw blood out of the glass, with some light bittering grapefruit that quickly follows suit. The brighter flavors are well-balanced by a supporting base of resinous pine, and some light herbaceous peppery complements."

"On tap at Prohibition Pig brewpub, Waterbury, Vermont. This was poured into a half pint glass, the brewpub normally pours it in. The appearance was a hazy blurry yellow color with a slim white little head that dissipated and left no lacing. The smell started off with a sweet citrus and sweet grassy blend leading into subtle crisp tropical fruits and underscored by just a little bit of bitter pine. The taste had a moderate amount of sweetness with some light bitterness of the pine carrying itself back into the balance of it all. A light citrus aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionable crispness carrying itself along my tongue. Overall, this was a very nice AIPA that I would have again."
"On tap at Haymaker, NYC, had the classic New England IPA looks with a lovely gold hazy hue, but the head was pretty small from the tap pour."
"Look: A light, dull orange color. "
In a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Had out of a pint glass at a bar.
On-draught @ The Ginger Man NYC.
"L - light orange, opaque, lots of lacing"
"This one pours a very hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
"First had this on tap at Alpine Beerco and Restaurant – Alpine, CA"
This is a solid from Beachwood- it tastes much better and fuller than than Tongue Tickles which was thinner in taste. This beer competes with the best of them and it is a grab from the shelf when you see it beer.
A - Pours a clear golden color with a one inch head.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."

"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
"A: Hoppy aromas of danky, white grape mixed with berries, coupled with a light cracker malt sweetness. "
On tap at Cellarmaker
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Mostly grassy and dank, herbal with a medium bitterness. Body is quite light and dry."
"i have always said that you could dump a boatload of nelson hops into a glass of urine and it would smell and taste delicious, so its always a little weird critically judging nelson beers. i love the hop so much that i favor almost any beer that uses it. this is one of the best examples of it, pure and true, unmolested by other hops, too much grain or alcohol, or time in a bottle. fresh as can be at the taproom, it has a pale yellow milky unfiltered east coast look to it under an inch of shaving cream thick white head. all nelson in the nose, pineapple from the can, white peaches, lemon meringue, and all the other aromatic elements this hop brings to the part so consistently. the flavor here is more like a pale than an ipa, not a lot of bitterness happening here at all. a nice juicy fresh hop flavor for certain, but it trails off a little at the end, primarily late kettle, whirlpool, and dry hopped i would imagine. some fruity notes, white grape, tangerine, pineapple in the taste, and a nice wheaty or oaty rich structured but nice and dry grain base for it. if you want to know what nelson hops do, this is a perfect example of it. i could have drank ten of these happily..."
"On-tap at Alvarado Street Brewery, Monterey, CA"
"From a growler into a high ball glass. Hotel life. Pours golden, hazy and with light carbonation. Light head. Sticky trails of lacing. 4.25"
Very nice nelson character

My favorite Trillium beer (so far) with hazy look and smooth finish. Tough to find it though as I'm not sure if this was limited.
"Excellent New England juicy IPA. My only mistake was having double dry hopped Summer Street before this base model. While DDH Summer Street is extraordinary, this is a solid, enjoyable beer from it's hazy golden color, to its light and satisfying series of flavor stages."
"Dated 5/8/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
12 oz bottle from a six pack purchased at the LCBO; bottled Aug 8 2018 and served slightly chilled.
"355 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchase came out to $3 CDn per bottle, but it's not often that we get SoCal IPA's available in this neck of the woods."
I don’t love it for some reason
"Like this a lot, have tried several Ballast Point beers, like them all, this is my favorite. Citrus in nose & taste, good mouth feel, expensive so I pick it up when on sale."

"My FAVORITE IPA. The blend of Mosaic, Warrior, Columbus and Amarillo hops just does it for me...and maybe the fact that Beachwood is local for me, I’ll get this 16oz can/4-pak at my local bottle shop when it’s just a few days old!"
"Poured from the can into a shaker pint glass, boo hiss... canned September 24 2018."
This is an exceptional beer. Every time I find it I only wonder why I didn't get more.
Thanks Damon.
Canned on 5/7; consumed on 5/26 - poured from a tall boy into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. 
"Clean golden color. Aroma has sweet honey and pollen notes, quite floral hop profile. Taste has a sweet malty backbone with floral hops and medium bitterness on the finish. Medium body, crisp carbonation."
"Pours a clear goden yellow with soapy, fine foam."
From a pint can.
Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass
An excellent IPA.
3-16
"16oz can from a four pack that cost $13.49. Aroma is heavy Mosaic, berries and some sweetness. Flavor is more Mosaic, berries, a nice malt backbone, some bitterness, a great West Coast IPA."
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to a tall, narrow pint (Green Cheek nucleated flute). This was canned on January 31, 19 days before the time of consumption, according to a black ink canning date on the underside of the can (""CANNED ON 01/31/18""). Refrigerated consistently. "
"Beautiful looking beer! Crystal clear straw yellow pour with a huge pillowy eggshell head. Had to give the look a 4.5 cuz it’s that pristine! Nose is piney. Full of sap, must and resin. Slight notes of grapefruit zest. Taste is of sticky pine sap, pine needles, light floral and crisp grapefruit. Some grainyness shows through as well. Medium body to slightly thin. Nicely coats my tulip with a thin oily film as well as the teeth ;) If I was ever questioning my love for “west coast” IPAs which I wasn’t this beer reaffirmed the beauty of a brilliant pine bomb!"
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
L - let's see how Sand City tackles single hops... pours a simultaneously light and dark orange. Vague haze. Minimal head. 
"Pours a hazy golden color with brown hues, a two inch, very well retained fluffy white head that left loads of lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, melon, a hint of pepper and citrus pith. Medium to Full bodied, smooth and slightly chewy mouth feel, well carbonated, slightly bitter and dry finish"
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (11 days old). Appearance is a fairly hazy orange brown with two finger thick head and decent retention. Smell is earthy hops, blueberry, spice (pepper), grapefruit, hay and a hint of resin and pineapple."
"Medium-pale gold body, faintly hazed; tall head of white foam left lots of messy lace behind... Aroma and flavor impressions of citrus, melon, grapefruit and pineapple... Moderately sweet, mildly bitter, amply carbonated... Soft and smooth, medium-light and fluffy body... Great showcase for Mosaic hops... 6/2/17 release date..."
"amber blood orange haze frothy white head. Strong citrus, mango, candied peach and honey on the nose. Resiny juice slightly malty light carbonation, melon and tropical fruit with a bitter smooth finish."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"Fresh draft at the brewery. Pours like a NE style IPA should...thick and totally hazy. The color is a weak orange coupled with yellow. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"elite level east coast ipa, as juicy and bright as any of the beers in here, insanely drinkable, and not just hazy to be hazy, the starchy grain base is awesome, almost creamy in texture, and there is so much hop character here, some residuals in suspension make a lot of sense. its still relatively low bitterness, although there is some balance to it, heavily dry hopped for sure though, so juicy and fresh squeezed tasting, navel oranges and meyer lemons and even green grape in the nose, a little more zesty lime and lemongrass character in the flavor, a cool mix of hop varietals i would think, but its hard to place specifically here, as its all so well integrated and unified and all of that, not separate or out of step at all. a really smooth feel, a little acidic oddly enough almost like actual orange juice, these guys are doing great stuff with the malts underneath the hops in these beers, this one seems to have some wheat structure too, but its also really dry, not quite biscuity but not one dimensional either, perfect for the hops. this has seemingly become one of their more popular beers, and rightfully so. downright delicious new school ipa right here!"
"First offering from The Fermentory...hopefully not my last. Aroma is off the charts floral! Taste is citrusy/fruity. Overall one of the best IPAs from the South. Put it up with Parish, Southern Prohibition, Civil, Heist, and Bearded Iris."
"Poured from a growler into a tulip glass (3 days old). Appearance is yellow brown in color and very opaque (1/2 finger thick head). Smell hits you with a sweet pineapple/honey/bubblegum flavor, which I assume is generated from their yeast, and citrus hop notes. Excellent, tons of floral hops."
A really solid NEIPA.
Growler obtained from Edmunds Oast Exchange.
"Honestly, have had all sorts of IPAs from all the big boys up north. This is easily one of my favorite."

Pint can dated 10/26/18 poured into a tulip at 46F
16 oz can into IPA glass. Dated 10/4/18.
One of the best NEIPAs I’ve yet to have. Hazy orange with a dank smell and taste of papaya mango grapefruit guava. Great beer.
"Very nice beer, had it at the same session I was having a Treehouse Julius and preferred it to that. Smoother and more complex. That said, I wouldn't drive an hour to get it and stand in line for another 30 minutes, like the Julius experience. But if it was available with reasonable effort I'd definitely be keeping it in the rotation."
"Nice bright, hazy orange color, good head and retention."
Perfect beer. Can’t say I’ve had a better one. The price is awesome too!!! NEIPA at its best.

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."

"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery two days ago. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
"Wow this is a superemely well balanced and delicate juicy IPA. Plenty of tangerine orange, grapefruit, lemon, peach, some nice piney and green notes that bring a mellow bitterness and bready malts dancing in the background. Excellent mouthfeel light/medium bodied with some slightly creamy texture."
"Growler. Poured very hazy. Aroma was pretty magnificent. They added a really neat assortment of hops in here. I love the Nelson and its nuanced aromatics. Its very fruity and tropical but there is also a good dose of pine and greens. I enjoyed the flavor a bit less than the nose but both were quite delectable. The flavor was more straightforward and slightly less intricate. Still, the combination of fruity and green was pretty excellent. Slightly earthy hop finish which I liked. Had more body than I was expecting. Creamy feel. Another stud."

Growler from the source.
At the source. Tastes like 2009.
"An absolutely lovely IPA in the style of Size 7 or Surly Furious, Town Hall's Masala Mama has inspired many imitators, but few can compare with the balance, delightful aroma and subtle bitter taste of the original."
Long time want - thank you Chris P!
"Pretty average IPA, moderate bitterness, sticky sweetness, fairly malt forward."
"Was super excited to try this given the high rating, but really disappointed when the beer hit my tastebuds. Had it at the tap room, very avg IPA"
"There is a reason Beer Connoisseur rated this one so high. I am not big fan of IPA; but this one is excellent! Pours a pale gold with a slight haze and nice head. Lots of interesting aromas - tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Goes down smooth and crisp. Has a nice snap of bitterness at the end, but not offensive or over done. Short aftertaste. If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."
"Tropicalia 12oz can poured int Duvel tuplic. ON 07/11/18, BY 10/09/18 stampd on bottom of can."
Out of a can at Max Lagers poured
"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.
This beer smells great with a very natural fragrant peach. Tastes like it smells but the best part is that the peach is not overpowering and let's the original Jai Alai flavor come through. It only adds to an already great beer. I never grew tired of drinking it and in fact had two which is rare for a fruit adjunct beer.
Off the chain. Jai Alai made sexy time with a peach and this was their baby. God bless the parents.

"Drank from a 750 ml growler purchased at Steady Habit Brewing Company, Haddam, CT"
"Big time citrus nose in this one. Sustained white head. Taste is full of citrus notes but not too over the top as some citra-hopped beers can be. Not abrasive. It has a nice soft malty base to it, maybe that's why. My kind of IPA. Mild but lasting bitterness in the end."
"Really smooth and drinkable for a double IPA, really liked it."
"L: Hazy, a little bit gold, a little bit orangish. Nice white head that leaves a speckled lacing on the glass. "
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
"Looks great - a hazy golden yellow with an off-white head and nice lacing. Smells like an orange creamsicle. Flavor-wise the vanilla is too strong, overpowering the oranges and hops. Slightly cloying which is not a good thing especially at just 6.5% abv. The slightly harsh mouthfeel has moderate carbonation. On the bright side, this might be the first IPA my wife enjoyed more than I did - she was a fan of the vanilla."
"Poured a light yellow-gold body with minimal head and no lace. The lactic/lupalin aspect dominates the aroma. Smooth, fuller body with a milky sweetness that I can’t quite pinpoint. Some hoppy dryness on finish with an earthy bitterness for some balance."
L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had an orange-amber color and a thick and cloudy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Solid lacing.
super orange beer with tiny little bubbles at the top. Almost no real head retention at all.

"Yakima Fresh is a bright and clear golden yellow with a dense and foamy bone white head. Streams of bubbles flow from bottom to top, and rings form on the sides of the glass."
"Description: Golden, honey color and clear with only a small amount of head. Smell is dank, tropical fruit (mango) and hoppy; pretty well balanced. Taste is similar but with floral notes as well. Feels sort of like an East Coast IPA with a danker, more bitter finish. Feel is light to medium body and medium to high carbonation."

Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
"Pours a hazed gold with 2+ fingers of whippy cream colored head. Clears a bit, very good lacing & head retention"
Slightly hazy golden color with a thick head. 
A home run
"Pale gold, really soapy enduring head, lively carbonation. Nose is pretty delicate with some bright, floral / citrus hop notes and some cracker malt. Taste has a light-to-medium hop resin underscored by some tangerine, nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes clean & bitter. Relies pretty have on Citra hops but well done regardless"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."

"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Pours a bright yellow color with a quick, fizzy white head leaving slippery lacing."
"This is a beer that intends to showcase the distinnct aromas of the Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. Indeed the beer has a nice citrusy and grassy aroma and taste to it, supported by some solid and tasty malts. Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours hazy, orangeish yellow. Thick, foamy, tall white head that Fades slowly to a long lasting rocky head with good lacing."
Pours a super hazy/ cloudy light mango-color. 1 finger of fluffy head with amazing retention and lacing.
"650ml bottle, freshly packaged, purchased at the brewery, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku glass. Enjoyed on 1.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."

Canned 4 weeks ago.
"L: opaque, matte honey lemon "
Canned 23 days ago.
"On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of tangerine and some pale malt. Tastes of orange and then bitter pith. Aggressive bitter pith that kinda ruins it. I'm all about bitterness, but this tastes funny. Medium body. Not Trillium's best."

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
16oz can poured into a pint glass shows an orange juice colored body and briefly floats a fluffy 1/4in yellowish foam that disippates to an edge hugging ring with a whispy island.
Can. Hazy sunset golden orange. White head with lace. This is first brewing project beer that I haven’t really enjoyed. It’s good beer but not up to BP standards for me. 
Very hazy orange juice colored beer with a off white/very light orange color. 
L_Hazy glowing tan/yellow
"Look: Full on Haze, deep murky golden brown. One and half fingers off fluffy white head. This looks the part. "
"If you like murky IPA, then this one fits the bill. OJ in a glass; full on haze; myriad lacing. The nose is insane with citrus aromatics, belied by underlying hints of mango, peach, and orange sherbet. Taste follows but isn't as pronounced as the smell, which isn't a bad thing, it's just not quite as impactful as the nose. Is it delicious? F*ck, yes! Citra hops are on point in this one. The finish is nice and creamy; my only gripe would be that it's not as chewy as I would prefer. All that said, this is an incredible beer worth seeking. I almost feel compelled to give the smell a 5.0, but I'll go with my initial reaction. Thanks, Micah!!!"
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pint can on February 3, 2018. Look is hazy orange gold thick white head and sticky lacing. Smell and taste is juicy citrus fruit and a hint of sweet malt. Feel is creamy and smooth."

"Appearance: light yellow, totally hazy-opaque, like a hybrid between yeast slurry and lupulin. The head is an off-white 1/8 finger of fine bubbles."
"16 oz can, canned on 3/22/18. Pours very murky light yellow with a small creamy white head that quickly goes to a thin film that laces the glass."
A growler purchased at the brewery on 09/23/17 poured in a Storm Peak 'Dogfish Head style' IPA glass. 
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.
absolutely perfect hazy ny style ipa. one of the best beers i've ever had.
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
"LUV the Soup series and Galaxy doesn't disappoint, great NE IPA look, nice smell w citrus notes and great taste and feel."
Undated tall can
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one inch, fluffy white head that left a little lacing. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon, tangerine, pine and a hint of pepper. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, mild bitterness, smooth mouth feel with just a minimal amount of dryness."
Incredible single hop (galaxy) NE haze IPA! They absolutely nailed this one!
Smells like nug after a few weeks!
"Medium-pale gold body, hazed to opacity, with a white head a couple of fingers high that left lace lines behind... Impressions of grapefruit, white wine grapes, and pale melon on the nose and tongue... Bright and light, but rounded with an earthier edge to keep it grounded... Mildly sweet, mildly bitter, creamy smooth, and easy-drinking... 10/1/17 release..."
"Had on tap at the brewery last weekend, but this review is from a can: pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 1-2 finger thick white head that's full of tiny bubbles, fading very slowly and leaving excellent foamy spider web lacing and rings as it went down. The lacing really sticks to the glass and is another masterpiece looking NE style IPA by Sand City, who have these looks nailed down."
Wow.
Poured from a crowler.
"On tap at Prison City Pub and Brewery in Auburn, NY."
"Revisiting this beer based on tasting notes, and I can't say that Paste Magazine's recent blind test (https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/247-of-the-best-american-ipas-blind-tasted-and-ran.html?p=4) does it any sort of disservice. Hazy orange, with a borderline pink hue. This is basically the beer version of Sunny-D. Big papaya, citrus, and pineapple aromas on the nose, followed by a massive punch of the same flavors on the body. Medium-bodied and satisfyingly drinkable. This is honestly the best beer that Upstate NY makes, and I'm proud to say that it's local. I hope that the folks at Prison City bring this one out year-round."
Had this beer on draft at the Brew Cafe.
This is a very nice and hoppy IPA with just about enough fruitiness to make it complex and refreshing. Smooth mouthfeel and a nice and long bitterness.
"Enjoyed at the 2016 Copenhagen Beer Festival in Boston, MA. Reviewed from notes."
Poured from tap at the Brew Cafe into a pint glass.
"SUPER cloudy and golden/straw color, peachy whit head. Smell is mango and maybe a hint of pineapple, definitely ripe fruit. Sharp bubble up front followed by a smooth, creamy, luxurious texture. Taste is mango and juicy, a little bubblegum on the back, some rind bitterness. The bitterness gets sharper as you work your way through, it started out tasting better than it does at the end."
"L - oh man, all I did was crack the can it it looks like liquid mangos. Can't wait to pour... wtf this is the yellowist I've ever seen beer! It looks like straight puréed mangos! Incredible! An absolute brick of solid milky hazy yellow. Sticky lacing dissipates quickly but desperately grabs at the sides of the glass. "
Pours a very cloudy yellow. Grapefruit Mango juice. Minimal head and lacing. 
"16oz can poured into a teku glass. Pours a smoothie-like yellow-orange. Nose is strongly mango, with a faint underripe mango, almost chemical, background on the nose. The palate is at first, somewhat Julius-like: lots of tropical fruit (predominantly mango) resting in a smoothie-like mouthfeel. The backend of the palate (for this batch particularly) has been causing controversy, with this release having been dubbed ""MagoTagoGate"". There's a strong, chemical burn, like a way-underripe mango on steroids. This Campden-tablet like flavor mars what would otherwise be an extraordinary beer. So much so, in fact, that Tired Hands offered a refund on this batch (the cost of the can + 50c). Given that, and given that Paperhouse - the release of MagoTago aimed at correcting this - was a homerun, I don't feel I can adequately review this beer based on having tried an off iteration. As such, I will be reviewing this similarly to Paperhouse, to be more consistent with the flavor that has represented the majority of this beer's existence."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"

"Pours a opaque yellow with a thin white head that faded quickly leaving some fine lacing. Aroma of citrus, passion fruit. Taste is passion fruit, lemon, lemon grass. Wheat grain bill is evident. Not really bitter at all more tart. Light body. Clean finish. Crisp and refreshing. Would be great on a hot summer day."
"Pours opaque golden yellow. Smells of stone fruit, yeast, and malt. Tastes intensely of bitter fruit and hops. Feel is thick and chewy with minimal booziness. Overall: not my favorite from Tired Hands, but pretty darn good. Light and refreshing compared to a lot of tired hands' beers."
"Golden straw color, hazy, small white head, great lacing. Grassy, herbal, passionfruit nose. Notes of passionfruit juice, lemongrass, lemon and herbs. Lighter side if medium, crisp and crushable. Solid and fruit forward IPA."
Very hazy gray-hued yellow with a thin bright white head that leaves heavy lacing. 
"Lovely hazy yellow with a nice head. Aroma is insanely tropical, with fruit being very prominent. The flavor profiles reflects very faithfully the nose and is as complex as any IPA I've had from Tired Hands. Very chewable."
8 oz. pour on tap at the Fermentaria.
"This one pours a very hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
"Great inbetween NE/West Coast style here. Really ripe fruits with a good pine/citrus rind backbone. On the very clean side with a sharp bite on the finish. I do prefer a bit more mouthfeel, but a good clean beer at the end of the day."
16 oz can into 7 oz cup 
Opaque orange-yellow with a large white froth that persists as a thin blanket and clings in a coral-like fuzzy wall.
"Can* dated 8/1/17 into pint glass. Pours a cloudy gold-orange with a thin off-white head. Initial impression is citrus/grapefruit, hints of pine, and a sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is mediuml as is carbonation. Finish is slightly sweet and tart. Quite enjoyable."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
16 oz can dated 6/14/18 and purchased at brewery. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
"L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had a bright, golden yellow color and a slightly hazy consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Pretty good lacing."
16 OZ can
"Home is a bright and light American IPA from Ocelot Brewing. I do like that it has details about the ingredients used right there on the label, even though I don't have enough knowledge to judge them individually."
The beer pours a nice white and foamy head that dissipate pretty quickly. The beer itself is a nice clear pale gold color that looks pretty nice. It has a nice golden metallic hue to it.
Love the contrast of the bright white head and the opaque orange yellow beer.

12oz. capped bottle into Night Shift stemware. 
"Pours golden. Smells of tropical fruits and pine. the taste is amazing balance of the tropical fruits (lemon, tangerine) and some hops. I agree that this tastes like an IPA. The feel is refreshing, clean and crisp as is Alpine's style."
"Advertised as a pale, I get how one can get it confused with an IPA. Intensely hopped it has aromas of chive and cannabis mostly. The resinous herbal character can also be found in the taste with a nice malt backbone. The carbonation is moderate and permits a full drinkability. "
"Holy shit, 69 IBUs in a 5.3% ale?? Now that's a session IPA. Pure Hoppiness was so damn amazing, I had to try this one too, although I rarely bother with light beers. I usually am not a fan of such nonsense."
12 oz. bottle poured into willibecher. 
Active brew. Very bubbly. Hard to tell if its the bubbles or there is a haziness. Smooth white head terrific lacing. 
"Smells tropical, pineapple mostly with some sweetness on the nose. Grapefruit pith and pine bitterness after slight initial sweetness. The slightly astringent bitterness sticks with you. This beer reads out more like an IPA to me with less attention to the malt. Well put together feel like a prickly IPA."
"Hoppy Birthday pours a light, clean amber color - carbonation is fairly minimal. Not much of a head, which dissipates rapidly."
12oz draft pour into snifterloudy boasts a golden orange hue and floats a fluffy 1/8in head of white foam that quickly disippates to a little more than a few isolated whispy islands and an edge-hugging ring. With agitation sheets of lacing leg it down to the ring.
Fantastic hoppy delight! From smell to taste and aftertaste the experience changes throughout the drink.. many different hop flavors and refreshing end was amazing!

"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 1 finger cream colored head, good retention and lacing. Pale luminous opaque golden in the glass. Smells of pineapple, citrus and some vegetal hops. Taste is initially pineapple, mango and slightly sweet orange juice, bitterness is a little more than most of these styles, think that is why I like this one, good sharp finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. One thing I want to point out is the shelf stability of this beer is better than any other NEIPA I have had. Did a blind tasting with this, Haze and Green and this was my top pick."
Had ontap from Growler garage Santa Rosa FL July 2018
Re-review a week later : 
"Grapefruit, pepper, dandelion greens, interesting take on a NEIPA."
Taste & smell is heavy pineapple.
Hazy and tasty!

A-Pours a very nice amber color with a nice head and lacing
Sometimes I get lucky and my brother in law from Ohio brings me some of this!
"Pours a slightly turbid, foggy orange with a finger of white head. Head forms fairly freely, and retains fairly well. Good lacing left behind. Aroma is pine, resin, and dank hops right at the front. They sorta stick and linger in the nostrils. A whiff of mango add a little extra depth, while throwing in a dash of sugar to the more bittery hop aroma. Flavor profile is mango, grapefruit, pine, and resin. It opens up with those sweet tropical fruit notes, but quickly works its way into a more bitter, evergreen forest-like finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a nice crisp finish that just has a touch of harsh carbonation to it. Overall, hops hit both sides of the spectrum, but balance and work each other out. Well rounded and developed IPA. "
"Golden body, matte and clear. Two and a half finger white, rocky head that dissipates to a patchy cap. Spare and sticky lace."

"32oz growler filled at the brewery hours ago. Pours a murky burnt orange color with no head. Trace amounts of lacing. The aroma is a sweet blend of mango, papaya, peaches and green tea. The taste is tons of ripe and juicy peaches with mango and papaya. Slightly herbal and piney towards the finish but the main flavor I get is the peach. Lightly toasted malts peek through at the end along with more herbal/piney notes. Mouthfeel is my only issue since there seems to be very little carbonation but it doesn't hurt it very much. Dry. Overall, a solid IPA I'll grab again."
"Pours a beautiful light amber with lovely, opaque yeast suspension. Smells like a tropical fruit basket: strawberries, peaches, mango. The taste is juicy, but not in an unpleasantly sweet way. A natural burst of fruit flavor atop a delightfully pungent hop punch. The best part of the beer is the finish: too many juicy IPAs finish sweet but this goes dry at just the right time, leaving your lips puckering and needing another sip. Simply my favorite Conmecticut IPA and a perfect example of what a single hop beer can be."
"Another great offering from Steady Habit Brewing. These guys know what they're doing. Pours hazy, 1"" pillow head. Tropical, fruity notes. Pineapple, mango and papaya. The Mosaic is very evident. I already see myself finishing off both 750 ml bottles tonight. Do yourself a favor if you're in the central CT area and swing by Steady Habit."
Yet another very solid hoppy offering from Steady Habit. I really like what they have going on over there and will be sure to stop by to try everything they put out.
"The smell is really amazing, and the taste follows suit. The mosaic hops create a myriad of tropical flavors ranging from citrus and mango, to pineapple and papaya. Poured fresh from a growler it didn't leave much head (strangely), and the mouthfeel was a tad too thin. I would like to revisit this one for a second opinion, but the smell and taste were above reproach. Definitely worth seeking."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"11/2/18 (Okemos, MI): 16 oz canned 10/2/18 3:25, multiple pours into snifter, gift from brother. Light golden pour, fluffy head, heavy carbonation, leaves nice white lacing. Light citrus aroma and balanced taste, slightly sweet citrus, bitter dry hops, excellent. Mouth feel creamy, very smooth, carbonation holds well. Overall very good IPA."
Absolutely a disappointment
"Had on tap. Finally got to try this after years of keeping an eye out. Was worried it wouldn't stand up to the ipas of today, I was happy to be proven wrong. As much as I love dry hopped ipas, this reminded me how much I loved wet hopped ones. The citra hops meld so well with the underlying caramel malts, giving you a burst of wet sweetness, that then is dominated by delicious hop bitterness. Good citrus fruit, grass and floral hops notes in smell as well. So much flavor for a single ipa."
"What a great beer, just ridiculously pricey in WI"
"Canned October 1st, 2018. Pours a slightly foggy amber with a thin white head. Smell is mostly dank hops with some citrus notes. Flavor has notes of grapefruit, pineapple, grass, and hop bitterness, all in abundance. Medium carbonation and body. Solid, very flavorful IPA, and I love Citra hops to boot, so this was the year to beat."
Can dated 10-1-18. Pours a clear honey yellow with a large white pillow of a head that lasts and leaves good lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit. Flavor is sweet ripe tropical fruit with a slight hop bitter finish. Feel is soft medium bodied. Overall a pretty nice beer without being too special. Expected more from a 4 day old beer from this brewery.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Difficuly to rate as it is so different. Get a lot of papaya, the sour culture cuts through it, and then the hop flavours come in. So inventive and a magnificent effort by the brewers to keep that level of balance. I would love to see how they make this, i think if i tried a homebrew i would get it wrong 100 times before it was remotely drinkable. As i finish it off i get hints of the other flavours, but for me the (ripe!) papaya was dominant."
"tastes like papaya juice with a hint of hops. typical goodness from HVB. I didn't get much coconut or green tea at all, though you could just call this a papaya IPA sour and still have it hit a home run."
"This one pours a super hazy and milky looking orange, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing."
"A: Going by the seemingly standardized appearance of these Hudson Valley sour IPAs, this is a shade or two darker than the norm, maybe 3:1 on the orange juice : pineapple juice ratio. Deep gold with hints of burnt orange. Typical thin, compact head formation that dissipates without much time. "
"Crazy delicious sour IPA---smell is always tart grapefruit, but taste is as usual very unique.... juicy papaya tropical goodness with a nice coconut finish--especially as it warms... green tea is in there as well just more subtle... taste like eating a whole roll of life-savor tropical fruit candies--with that rare coconut one in the mix..."
"This beer is insane. The apotheosis of HVB achievements and the style they’ve essentially created and mastered (sour lactose laden blended hoppy beer with fruit purée). Just explosively flavorful and at the same time beautifully balanced. Not gimmicky at all, just a tremendously drinkable and appealing beer. Paired this with handmade Shanghai dumplings and noodle dishes and the moderate sourness and fruit sweetness, with the subtle hop bitterness in the finish, cleansed the palette and held its own against another tremendously flavorful offfering. Wow."
"Really great beer. Perfect hazy look, tight pearl head. Smell is sweet grapefruit and spices. Taste is wonderful grapefruit, hint of honey, with a creamy mouthfeel and a citrus twang on the finish that is awesome"
"Super hazy NE IPA body with a fizzy, off-white head that fades to a sparse, soapy residue atop. Aromas of pineapple, fruit punch, sweet citrus. Loads of fruit character in the flavor. Tangy acidity with a light body. Prickly carbonation a la soda. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"well, holy shit. is this the new direction? and to think we were enamored with 'west coast IPAs' just a few years ago..... lots of flavor. slight tartness. very nice!"
Smells like straight grapefruit
"This one pours a super hazy and quite milky looking yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Hudson Valley continues to impress with this delicious entry into their sour/brunch IPA series. This one falls somewhere in the cross-section of Crush! orange soda, melted Creamsicle pops, and fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice. It's offers both tartness and sweetness, but the two keep each other in check wonderfully, resulting in an extremely intense yet easy/pleasurable drinking experience. Ride of bright, creamy citrus flavors is capped on the finish by a delicate, somewhat grassy, somewhat minty bitterness that is likely the contribution of the Motueka dry hopping. The feel is medium with even, soft carbonation, accenting the refreshing drinkability of this beer. Another delicious creation by these alchemists!"
"Just a fantastic beer in every way. I went to HV for my first release and came away impressed by everything from the brewery, the people, vibe and most importantly the beers. All were excellent and this was the best. So juicy - smooth and full of citrus goodness with just the right amount of sour tartness. You get that nice juicy IPA hop hit up front and then the wonderful sour/tartness on the back end. Quite possibly the best IPA I had in 2017. Well done."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
"L: hazy to murky gold blanketed by 3"" of persistent, white lacy foam"
"Vanilla is just a tad too strong, but overall really good milkshake IPA."
"This beer has made me rethink everything I've thought I've know about beer. It's outstanding. It tastes like a creamy orange julius, but it's a BEER! My mind is blown."
"Overall an amazing beer. The look is a cloudy orange. You put your nose up to the glass and are greeted by a sweet citrus fragrance. I could just sit and smell this beer. The taste is a soft more smooth orange, like an orange dreamcicle. This is perhaps one of my favorites. Try it and enjoy!"
"This one pours a very hazy and glowing orange, with a fluffy whipped looking head, and lots of lacing."
Super hazy/cloudy pale gold. White head with lace. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. 
"A bit more bitter than say... Double Sunshine, but great hop flavor. And a lovely mouthfeel. I think it's not so much that it's more bitter, as it has less of the citrusy complimentary flavor."
they cant all be home runs. This is a solid double to left....
Quite bitter as one would expect to go along with the nice aroma from dry hopping. Poured a nice head with medium bubbles. Not creamy which is OK. I’d be happy to find a glass of this anytime.
"A great IPA, if you enjoy a strong hop flavor and citrus. It finishes somewhat bitter, but that reenforces what it is."
Mighty tasty. Pretty good
Draft. Clear amber appearance. Medium malty back with citrus + earthy front.
"Near perfect NW IPA, crisp and biting. Orange amber body with substantial creamy head. aroma of hops, and more hops. Taste , too. Barley Brown’s knocked this one out of the park."
"Copper gold, with a bit of haze and a frothy soapy white head. Smell is light, not much there, just pine. Flavor is big green chlorophyll. Lots of pine, and bitter green lettuce. Good but one note for me. Finish is extra dry from the huge amount of hops and lasts a long time. Not my favorite. Hops are tasty, bright and zesty, but this just seems like an attempt to cram in a bunch of hops without really crafting a balanced beer. Not my style."
"My hometown Brewery and Pub.... well it's 65 miles away, but I call it home."
"Chill haze light amber without much head, but what's there leaves some good drippy lace. "
"This hits all the right notes for an IPA. Piney and citrus in abundance. Intensly hoppy finish, as it should be. All around solid IPA. Don’t pass this one up."
"On tap at Engine House 9 in Tacoma, WA."
"Poured from a growler at a day old. Pours a deep golden amber with a thick tan foam head. The nose is of malt and light tree bark. Taste is malt forward. Caramel sweetness to it along with herbs, grasses and a very faint citrus lemon peel. The lemon peel is almost herbal tea like or medicinal. Medium to full body with a semi crisp clean finish. Good beer."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation.

Super solid and smooth.

"I received this from @vidblain in a BIF box. Canned 8/20/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a color something between orange and ruby with a huge, milk-white head and lots of clinging lacing. The nose is decidedly malt-forward. There's not much fruit but a fragrant smell of hops. The taste is interesting: it's malty with roasty barley and a hint of caramel or toffee up front but the complex hop bill of Amarillo, Simcoe, Cascade, and Warrior is bitter and bites hard. It finishes with a bitter after taste. I really like how the bitter hops and sweet malt battle for supremacy. This ale has a nice, creamy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and at 6.7% ABV a second pour is a must. Overall, I like this a lot! It's an IPA with an attitude."
Nice IPA and good bitterness. Easier to drink than Todd.
Nice beer if you like hops
"Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass at Beer Head Pub in Schaumburg, IL. Another great beer from Surly. The appearance was a cloudy orange color with a medium sized white head. The taste and aroma was malt and pine."

In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Hazy golden color. Aroma has dough notes with some grassy and floral hops. Taste is balanced, a bit acrid, dry, astringent. Decent but not Tree House level."
"this was super clean and crisp... some citrus peel and grapefruit notes, a mellow sweet and bready malt profile balances it out and the mothfeel is very soft. smooth easy drinker!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"Pours a hazy light golden color, like watered down orange juice. Weak nose, faint orange, citrus, sharp pungent aroma. Very hop forward, not a lot in the malt department. Sharp and crisp, loads of mango, papaya, pineapple, orange, lemon. Big mixture of citrus and tropical flavors. Crisp and refreshing, nicely carbonated. Overall this is a very drinkable IPA, just not my style (tastes overly dry hopped)."
01/03/17 stamped on the bottom of a tall can
Poured from can. Dark golden color. Hazy. Not getting much nose. Taste is thick and juicy. Slightest linger on the tongue.
"A: Chalky gold to start. Starts to glow over time, burst of orange more and more apparent. Creamy off-white white. Frothy, whispy lacing. "
"Deep muddied gold, opaque, topped with an ivory head of foam. Aromas and flavors of dank orange citrus pith, has earthy and musky undertones with brighter points of tangy juice. Medium-light weight and feel, smooth with a slowly gripping bitterness. Moderate sweetness and soft carbonation. Spot-on for a Citra IPA. 3/10/17 canning."

Strong tasting IPA
I had this one at the brewery and liked it so much I brought a growler back to my hotel. 
"Soapy head and apricot opaque color. Aroma is caramel, bready malt, and pine. Taste follows the nose, but quickly disappears with no lingering bitterness or aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with prickly carbonation. Harsh and not very balanced. Overall a rather unremarkable IPA."
Big thanks to richj1970 for another hoppy treat form Al.
Great combo of malt backbone and hoppy fruity flavor. Unbelievable GP doesn’t make this a year round option
This is by far the best IPA in Birmingham. Great color with a Citrus punch that does not disappoint on taste. Well balanced carbonation that feels like a hoppy IPA is supposed to (Sculpin). Seasonal in cans is a big mistake IMO. This needs to be a Signature brew enjoyed by the masses year round.
I usually look to Good People when I'm seeking a more hop forward IPA in Bham. Hitchhiker takes a step back from that a little and showcases a little more citrus and fruity notes while still preserving that piney hopiness. This is a quite balanced beer with good amber/apricot color. Medium carbonation and is my favorite of their IPA arsenal.
"Golden near amber draft pour to shaker, no head but good lacing. Pineapple, dank nose, a little kiwi. Full flavor that is mainly bitter, some fruit and malt notes follow. Above average body and below average carbonation."
12 oz can with a 2017 date stamp. 
"Big, floral nose. hoppy taste with a punch of citrus. Lingering aftertaste."
"This is a pretty good little beer that I got as a extra in a trade. Pours a golden cooper with huge white head. Nose is floral and light fresh citrus. Floral up front on taste followed by fresh cut grapefruit, light Lemmon zest, grass and caramel malts. A small bit of that sticky quality I so love. Medium body with a crisp finish"
Poured from a 12 oz can into a clear glass tulip. PKG 03/02/17 on bottom rim of can.
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

Mouth feel crisp with some pine bitterness in finish but floral/tropical hops are in charge here. A delightful IPA."
"On-tap at Cycle Brewing, St. Petersburg, FL"
"Received as a gift from a fellow BA. I was quite impressed. This beer had pretty much everything I look for in an IPA. Not as in your face hoppy as some-which I happen to like, just a very enjoyable topnotch IPA"
"Sent a crowler by my brother for Christmas. Cloudy, dark orange, very little in the way of foam or lacing, lots of sediment at the end of the crowler. Dank, citrusy notes on the nose. Taste is a balance of mildly bitter and citrusy hops. Zesty and dank, gentle alcohol presence. Pretty good."
Exceptionally good.

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

Lightly-hazed golden color with a finger-and-a-half of off-white foam head. Decent retention and nice rings of lacing.
"On tap at Lawson's Finest Liquids in Waitsfield, VT."
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a slight head and lacing
Poured into a becher pint glass.
"16oz can from the brewery. Pours a golden brown with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is lots of sweet pine and citrus hops. Bready malts as well. The taste is grapefruit, citrus peel and grassy hops along with a big punch of pine. Piney finish with a good amount of the malt flavor. Tastes boozier than the ABV. Oily mouthfeel and nicely bitter."
"grassy, dank, floral, slightly spicy pine, some grapefruity and orange notes dancing around, mellow bready/crackery malt, and a hint of mango in the background. very clean and balanced, a classic west coast style IPA."
"GREAT COLOR AND AROMA IN THIS IPA. LAWSON'S DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. Hard to get on Ohio, usually have to have someone guy for us and send to us. Very nice Brew!"
Wish this was more readily available! This fucker is delightful and I'm a bigger fan over their sunshine line
Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip.

"Poured from tap at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT into their flute."
"Cloudy, hazy pale orange body with a fluffy bone-white head. Aroma is oranges, limes, dank grass, hints of tropical fruits, fruity candy. Big orange and lime flavor up front, with a wave of big juicy tropical hops from the middle to the finish. Feel is slightly creamy, well carbonation with a lingering stickiness. Really solid fruited IPA."

Nice malty backbone. This beer has changed over the years but still an excellent IPA.
Canned on 07/31/18 stamped on bottom of 12 oz. can:
Very fun of the mill IPA. Really nothing truly special about this IMHO. The stouts from Cigar City Breweing are something really special. This was mundane.
"ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE IPA OF ALL TIME!! Had the pleasure of trying this on draught multiple times on vacation in Clearwater, then I moved to Tampa shortly after. This beer is so great on draft and surprisingly great out of a can. Unfortunately they don’t bottle it but if you don’t live in an area that sells it often you should get your hands on it. You won’t regret it if you truly love IPA’s."
Solid beer for what it is
"Don't understand the 4.0s and higher. This is a run of the mill west coast style IPA, dime a dozen in my opinion. Very simple taste profile, mainly bitterness. Not that it's bad, but not a 4.28 average at the time of this review. That's getting into Treehouse range, and there's simply no way this beer flies at that altitude. Much prefer Sam Adams NEIPA and Rebel to this, as well as Voodoo Ranger, SN Celebration Ale and Torpedo, Lagunitas Sucks and Maximus at this price point or lower."
"L: coppery color, clear"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

"awesome stuff, there is a reason everyone in minnesota is talking about this beer as one of the best wet hops in the game, i have to agree, maybe my favorite beer from these guys so far. its clear and rich brassy golden and frothy white headed from the tap, with a stunning aroma, even shocking, of mosaic, cleaner and fresher than i have really ever known it to be. they must use a ton of hops here, its oily and west coasty and kind of rich to me, loaded with lupulin and myrcene and all the other goodies in here, concentrated and intense for a wet hop, with just a pale malt base it seems, thats all that needs to be there. i get none of the now tired mosaic fruitiness, its elevated way beyond that pineapple citrus thing, and none of the cat pee character i sometimes get when its over dry hopped, its perfect here, a wonderful version of itself, an example to others i hope, so darn good. some bitterness to which is nice, but this drinks like a california pale ale to me, and i mean that as a high compliment. worthy of the hype, this is next level hoppy beer. others from outside the state have no idea what they are missing here, this should be in the national conversation. it really took my by surprise. ill look forward to this each fall when i am up north! as good as mosaic gets."
Appearance - pours clear golden color with big fluffy white head that settles to a fairly thick cap. lots of spotty lacing.
"Pours light Amber. Tall foamy, Whitehead the Fades fast with light lacing."
"Pours on the yellow side of a clear amber with a white head. Good retention and lacing. Floral and slightly spicy hop presence on the nose with a touch of citrus. The taste is grapefruit and grassy notes in abundance, with a sweet malt presence to back it up. Drinks more like an APA than an IPA. Smooth, lightly carbonated, and medium-bodied. Great beer as always from Castle Danger."
"I have no idea how people could rate this beer poorly. If this is you, you need your taste buds revoked."
"Mosaic IPA pours a copper color, with a big long lasting and lacing head. Big fresh hoppy aroma, that can fill the room. Taste is big, hints of earth, lots of tropical fruit, grapefruit and big hop flavors that finishes sweet. Good body and feel. Overall fantastic IPA, big flavors, complex, does finish sweet."
Golden orange color. Clear. White head. On tap.
"Poured from a pint can 2 weeks fresh. Aroma is of melon and floral notes. Taste is Intense and pure mosaic at its best. One finger spongy head dissipates soon but laces nicely. Amber and slightly opaque. This may beat Sosus for the best mosaic I've had. Flavor matches the nose but is more intense. Creamy mouth feel with appropriate carbonation bordering Niro feel. Now having a second the next day and this is legit. The flavor is insane--one that the nose hints toward, but the nose isn't huge."
"This beer pours a slightly murky orange with a large, uniform head. The aroma is bold and vibrant, with huge guava, passionfruit, honeydew, pineapple, mango, candied pineapple, and overripe apricot and peach. The flavor is still vibrant, but not overly assertive, with soft guava, papaya, candied pineapple, mango, and overripe peach. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy carbonation. Overall this is a pretty wow beer - the aroma is huge, but the flavor much more demure, all leading to a very drinkable, sensuous beer."
First purchase (10/17/17) of the 2017 offering (stamped canning date is 10/10/17).

"Canned 03/28/18, ‘BLEED BLUE’."
"Really good single IPA. Hazy, good smell to it, but it's not a double IPA which people forget when they think it's got a lesser flavor and smell than their DIPAs. For an IPA, it's extremely good and smooth. Velvety."
16 oz. can dated 09/12/17
"Really hazy golden color with white head. Aroma has some caramel malt and slightly dank hops. Taste starts juicy, just slightly sweet, continues with ""green"" hop notes and finishes with some white grapes and light bitterness. Medium to full bodied, really smooth but also well carbonated. Overall it's another great juicy IPA from Monkish."

"From a can poured in a tulip glass. Friend brought back from NC. This is a really well made, traditional American IPA. Pour is a beautiful copper gold color. Small head with lacing that lingers. Smell is nice, intense resiny peach and slight piney grass, with a hint of bready malt scent in the backend. Taste is well balanced bitter and malt. I taste the tangerine, pine, grass, light caramel, lemon zest and sweet malt flavors. Maybe a touch of biscuit. Definitely not a session IPA; substantial body and thickness to the beer. Body is well-balanced. This isn’t as juicy and tropical as more recent IPAs, definitely reminding me of really good IPAs from ~5 years ago. This isn’t my favorite hop combination, but it is purposeful and just so well-executed that I had to rate it highly."
Hopping dropping and rolling
Very good. Had pint can at airport bar in Charlotte. Opened with blast of juicy fruit and finished a little heavier on the pine. Smooth decent body for a can suggests good malt backbone. So does rich bready taste that fills out /helps but stays in background to hop attack.
Good solid IPA!
"Poured from a 16 oz can dated 7/12/18, into a Willi Becher pint glass."
Love the fruity finish on this beer. The hops are great
"Plastic glass at CLE airport. Wanted an iPA so not sure what I was getting. Nice surprise. Nice color no real head (bartender was careful not to have one). But nice lacing in the glass. Nice citrus hop aroma which matches the taste. The citrus does not overpower the nice malts which leaves to nice overall flavor. Was surprised with the apv, tastes like a good summer drinking beer but a bit high for a hot afternoon. No faults. If you like a citrus ipa you will like it!"

had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"The appearance was a hazy golden bronzed orange color with a thin white layer of foaminess. No lacing. The smell had started off with some sweet citrus and bitter grapefruit rind. Light sweet onion dankiness strolling in underneath. The flavor copies the smell pretty much the same. Light sweet danky onion and citrus aftertaste. Semi-smooth sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent ssessionably low carbonated smooth feel. Overall, great AIPA, definitely would have again!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."

"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."

Very cloudy with a dirty gold color. Moderate head but it leaves a good blanket of lace. 
"Almost completely opaque orange-yellow with a moderate, bright white dense fuzz settling to a persistent thick collar."
"This beer pours a very cloudy dark golden yellow color with a three finger, frothy off white head. Retention is excellent and there are many hanging chunks of lacing left on the glass."
"Can from the Fort Point brewery in Boston, MA, whislt in town for EBF. Can was two thirds full :( Pours moderately hazy with minimal head and nice lacing, smells and tastes like spicy dank citrus candy, medium to thin bodied. Quite nice, great hop nip."
A: vibrant pale orange color with some darker amber notes towards the middle. Bright white head
"This one pours a very hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
"folks are really loving this one it seems like, and its delicious, and obviously highly preferable to just about any of the blood orange ipa types that have flooded the market in recent years, but they have a winner with this ipa, it really doesnt need any tweaks. it always seems weird to me when a brewery takes an amazing flagship-esque beer like this one and makes changes, its famous for a reason. that said, the mango added tastes fresh to me, its not too sweet, and most importantly of all, its dosed lightly enough to accent the base beer without taking it over, i would have been real disappointed if this covered up the goodness that is the original. the hops and the mango go great together, and this being on the maltier side anyway, there is a lot of support in body so the mango doesnt change the feel too much. its a nice fresh sunny mango flavor, juicy and natural, and it works. i think it brings out the sweetness of the malt a bit much for my personal taste, but the beer remains very balanced. i definitely still prefer the original, its a staple, but this is a nice little variant, nice fresh mango and not too much of it."
"Mango keeps getting me on some of my favorite IPAs, and this is no exception. I keep thinking more fruit might throw off the balance, but maybe I just like them that way."
Mango mama pours a darker cooper color with a small head. Hoppy ipa aroma with sweet mango notes. Taste is mainly iPad with subtle sweet mango flavors. Good body and flavor. Overall nice ipa with subtle mango.
"On tap at the Tap, into a tulip, pours a clear deep orange-Amber with minimal off white head that dissipates quickly. Some bread and a lot of overripe dark mango on the nose. No hoppy bite on the tongue, no bright tropical flavors...a lot of mango pulp, though...some depth of flavor, but not much complexity. Disappointed. Give me the regular any day...I've heard such good things about this one that I really want this to be a flawed batch, even though I don't think there are technical flaws here."
On tap at Town Hall.

10/1/18 can
gimme moh booze kehd. Double i guess i need.
12 oz. can. Hazy bright orange. Smells of papaya and some orange zest. Malt behind it is substantial as well. Almost smells of oats. Tastes of tangerine and some sweet melon hops. Still has almost an oaty malt flavor. A little sweet and a little toasty. Medium body. Faint bitterness. Excellent.
"This one pours a very hazy orange color, with a small foamy head and lots of lacing."
12 oz. can (!!) dated 7/23/18. Purchased at brewery 7/28/18 and poured into Carton Dubvariant glass.

"Pours with an aggressive very white head. Took a bit to wait for it to settle down. Pale yellow body and quite cloudy to pulpy OJ looking. Very nice citrus, tropical fruit hop aroma. Even a little sweet. No particular resin quality. "
Love a cloudy mysterious dense delectable IPA LIKE THIS ONEO
"Straight up pineapple flavors. Way more tropical than any ""tropical"" beer I have ever had. Personally I want a bit of orange in this to help balance the pineapple, but still very good."
"Very hazy on the pour. Decent carbonation. Mosaic hops, citrus and some hay on the nose. The taste has some really nice flavors with the hops, citrus and dry earthy tones on he finish. Feel is dry and thin on the end which was nice with the flavor combo but could use some beefing up."
"Tangerine, orange creamsicle, lemon, grapefruit juice, melon and hints of pine. Zesty. Cracker malt. Dank and delicious. Finishes fairly dry. Nice level of sweetness. Really good."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
Can dated 10/25/18. Poured into tulip.
Had this on 2018-07-07 at their Fermataria brewery and again on 2018-08-04 from a 16oz canned on 2018-06-28.
"Really nice light IPA, crisp and refreshing, honey comes through nicely."
"Like a Focal Banger clone, except way less lighter. My favorite sweaty hops note."
"There is a reason Beer Connoisseur rated this one so high. I am not big fan of IPA; but this one is excellent! Pours a pale gold with a slight haze and nice head. Lots of interesting aromas - tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Goes down smooth and crisp. Has a nice snap of bitterness at the end, but not offensive or over done. Short aftertaste. If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."
"Tropicalia 12oz can poured int Duvel tuplic. ON 07/11/18, BY 10/09/18 stampd on bottom of can."
Out of a can at Max Lagers poured
"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.
Can poured into a sampling glass
L- Pours a surprisingly light colored beer that's golden with a slight carbonation visible. Three fingered head is present.
Light copper colored with a heavy amount of moderate to large sized sediment suspended within. There's a quarter inch to an inch of brown frothy foam resting on top. The aroma is of oranges and citrus hops. I'm tasting plenty of citrus hops and then some strong undercurrents of blood orange and the corresponding acidity. The mouth is dense and moderately acidic.
"Had this on tap in a nice Frosty Glass. While I don't have quite the pallet that most of you all do... I thought immediately, ""this is definitely one of my favorites coming out of Georgia."" This brew is an enjoyable experience!"
Only 2 months old but tasted stale and out of class. Not sure why rating is so high here.
"Poured into a Spiegelau tulip from a can dated sometime in April (no date on the can itself, but I know the date on the 6-pack I bought was sometime in April). Liquid is bright cloudy orange, and the pour kicks up a solid head that fades pretty quickly to a ring and a film."
Poured from a 12 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy golden yellow with a large white head. The aroma is fresh citrus. The taste is a mice mix of hops and oranges.
Poured from 12 oz can into Duvel tulip. No freshness date.
"12oz can, undated, assumed to be fresh, poured into a 14oz snifter glass."
I know i've been on BHB tear. Had this this last summer i cannot wait for it to come back on the shelves. great looking can. what an amazing beer. yes!
"Poured from a bomber dated 2/25, I had been wanting to try this one for awhile so didn't pay attention to the date when I grabbed it. The smell after opening the bottle was great, very citrusy. Poured a beautiful burnt orange color but was loaded with sediment, not sure if that's normal or not. Let it settle some and drank gently. Taste was grapefruit with good carbonation. I'll try a fresh one if I find one but seriously thinking about drain pouring this one due to the sediment."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."

"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
A 16 oz can dated 4/20/18 poured into a Tree House teku. 
"Smell: This has that huge yeasty pink bubblegum note that is just bursting out of the glass. Along with huge tropical fruits. Pineapple chunks, mango, papaya, watermelon, apricot, mandarin oranges. There isn’t really any malt presence to speak off. This is just an amazing smelling beer full of fruit and bubblegum. Probably the best nose I’ve smelled on a treehouse beer."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
This was superb; it's a delicious step above regular King Julius without being silly or over the top.
Probably the best hoppy beer they have brewed.

"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
It is very good beer
"Pure hop juice right here. There's ethanol on the finish that's a bit of a let down, but yum everywhere else."
Call me crazy - but my first experience with Very Hazy was not a particularly overwhelming one.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."

"As close to a “perfect” beer as I’ve ever had. The gold standard for New England IPAs, it truly lives up to its hype. Wish it was easier to get but oh well. Can’t wait to have it again."
"Deep golden color, a bit of hoppy haziness. Pours a nice white head, creamy and lingering."
"Unfiltered, drink straight out of the can, fruity aroma and juicy flavor with just the right feel to make you have to make another swig"
Can:
This beer revolutionized what a beer can be. I will never forget the smell when i first cracked a can it was unlike any beer i have ever had. I continue to think this is the gold standard for New England IPAs.
The hazy (but not cloudy) amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1 1/2” fluffy off-white head that recedes slowly but visibly until it eventually becomes a thin irregular island of foam on the surface with a ring around the glass and having left a webbing of patches and irregular streaks of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a couple of arch shaped patches of foam with some small patches and legs of lacing between the two.
Tastes much better out of the can as indicated!
nother of my favorites. Awesome beer/

"16oz can. Pours a turbid pale orangey yellow with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, lime and orange. Some dank notes as well. The taste is pineapple and tangerine along with dank hops. Orange pineapple juice at the end with some resinous pine and a hint of toasted malts. Creamy with a dry mouthfeel. Fantastic Double IPA worth seeking out."
Typical treehouse ipa greatness. Fruits hop aromas on the nose with that soft pillowy mouth feel that we all love from Treehouse. Fruit aromas are completely backed up on the palate as well
"Whoa, this is incredible; traditional Green pine, but it takes the juiciness, creaminess, and fruitiness I associate with Julius and puts it up front and center; flavorful, superb body, and just dope."
Probably the best beer I’ve had recently.
"Born-on date: 8/17/18 (with a reference to the Queen of Soul stamped on the bottom of the can); consumed on 9/6/18, so this one is 20 days old."

"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Great taste and smell. Very easy to drink.
"A strong pour was needed for a 1/3 finger sized off white short lived foamy head. Irregular punctuation mark lacing, the head quickly shrunk to a ring. Labeled can, blue green dot, 11/02/18, is this too fresh? "
"Super juicy, super citrus. Nice and thick"
"Jon, thank you so much for this can. You're the best!"
probably the best IPA I have ever had.
"I've only rated one other beer 5's across the board, and that was a Double IPA. This is the best Low/Mid-ABV IPA out there, no doubt in my mind. Orange nose and flavors galore, and a joy to drink. This is a famous beer, and it lives up to its reputation. It is the standard to which all other juicy, NE-style single IPAs should strive. If you are seeking to enjoy the best that beers have to offer, Julius is the one to savor."
Massive citrus juice with plenty of Orange more so than mango. Nose and taste were big and pleasant. Great biscuity malt to back up the huge hops. Very drinkable but a bit bright vs soft on the carbonation. Then again could just be can vs draft.
Consistent top 10 beer out there.
look: Hazy peachy orange. Have admired this in pics for a while and up close doesn't disappoint.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

"Lightly-hazed, syrupy-looking orange-gold with a fat finger of antique white head. Thick rings of lacing."
"Gorgeous burnt orange color, very hazy, with a dense, sudsy light tan head. Wow. Juicy oranges on the nose, and there’s also an earthy, herbal note that is really cool. I am now drooling."
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a slight head and lacing
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
64oz growler thanks to airfoil. Served in HF tulip.
"Pours a crystal clear, deep golden color with a rapidly dissipating off-white head that gets perpetually fed by carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sweet grapefruit nose is so inviting. Full body that enters the mouth so smoothly you'd think it was nitrogen. Lovely citrus through and through without overpowering. This IPA has nice balance."
A- Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some nice spotty lacing.

On tap at Alpine. Tulip glass.
"From a tulip glass, maybe two weeks old and kept cold. At one point, this was my favorite beer from Tree House (and therefore in the world). This time, the beer is amazing, but it's not screaming ""I'm better than all other Tree House beers."" If you can get it, get as much as you can. It's fruity, but not overly so. It's balanced … close to perfect and amazing. But I won't drive 3 hours round-trip for 8 of these if, on another day, I can get 24 of some of the other selections."
Very smooth and hoppy characteristics!
"Picked-up eight cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton on Saturday. My 19th beer reviewed from these guys. This is one of my favorites. Very smooth, does not go down like 8.2."
Drank out of the can on Halloween night. Quite delicious with a slightly bitter finish.
Pours a super hazy orange with half as finger of white head.
"Pours a cloudy orange with a one inch white head that left ample lacing. Smells of tropical fruits with a hint of pine and citrus.. Tastes of overripe peach and mango, papaya, orange, a bit of orange zest, sweet malts and pine. Medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy mouth feel, finishes slightly dry and bitter."
Goddamnit.
Very solid double IPA. Basically doppelgänger with more hops. Extremely well balanced and soft. An amazing beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and balanced with crispness and cirtus.
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

"On tap at The Lark in East Northport, NY and it had good NE style IPA looks except the lacing was minimal. Smells super juicy and dank with tons of citrus fruit, but the flavor drops off a bit with less citrus intensity and plenty of sweetness from th caramel, toasted grains and graham cracker. It’s very smooth and easy to drink, but did not live up to the hype like it did the first time I had it 5 years ago."
"On tap at Jealous Monk. Pours a hazy dark orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Great aroma of citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple, grapefruit, lime, passionfruit, mango and orange. The taste is much like the aroma. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange and mango along with some herbal and dank hops. Some malts peak out at the finish along with the herbal hops. Boozier than expected. Oily mouthfeel with a medium body."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden color, minimal head. Citrusy hop aroma. Loads of flavors: mango, lemon, orange, slight dankness,, lingering biter finish. Overall a very well balanced DIPA."
"On tap, pours a moderately hazy deep orange. White foam head leaves good lacing. Smell and taste are packed with a complex array of fruit and pine. Easy drinker for the ABV. Kind of straddles the East Coast and West Coast IPA divide. Great, great beer."
Pours a nice white and creamy fluff head that dissipates quickly. Beer is a hazy light orange and looks good.
"What a pleasant surprise to see this available on draft at Ginger Man, NYC. So nice to luck into a hard to find and highly rated Ale. "

"After a hard day working, this is an amazing treat! Everyone knows how good this stuff is, and I’m equally impressed as everyone! One of HF’s best!"
This beer is absolutely amazing. So refined compared to a lot of dipas. 
Had on tap and brought two 750ml growlers home. 
It's been awhile since I've had this one but I remember a hazy and enjoyable IPA from the NE. I don't think it was as fresh as I would have liked it but I was in Texas and can't complain.

Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."

"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Cloudy gold color, thick white foam, taste is more piney and it’s on the dry side. Interesting DIPA interpretation but I like the original version better."
"Canned on 10/10/18, best by 1/29/19"
This beer didn't live up to the hype for me. The finish lacked which is what I really look for in a good beer.
Best by 01/29/19.
"I received this from @bstyle in a trade. Poured from 16 oz. can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours an opaque, golden-tangerine color with two fingers of bright white, fluffy head and lots of spotty lacing. What a dynamite aroma! Lemon, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lactose/vanilla, and soft floral hops. You can smell it the moment the top is popped. Wow, this is close to perfect: It opens with big tangerine, pineapple, and tart lemon and grapefruit. I'm also tasting ripe melon. The vanilla/lactose provides a creamy sweetness, and the Citra hops are highly flavorful and moderately bitter but without a strong bite. To me, it doesn't drink like 100 IBU. It has a pleasantly creamy mouth feel with moderate carbonation, and the 8% ABV is perfect. A second pour is a must. Overall, King Sue is exquisite - wonderful, bold flavors that balance well, and super drinkable. I'm glad to finally have tried this World Class DIPA."
Appearance - pours super turbid yellow with huge foamy white head and tons of sticky lacing.
Thank you bstyle for this
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

"Beautiful beer. Pours a bright turbid straw yellow to orange. Thick bright white head on heavy pour. Nose is sherbet like. Orange peel and juice. Taste of citrus. Notes of orange, grapefruit peel, lemon zest and peaches. Honestly one dimensional as in I really only get those citrus notes. But they are huge! And delicious. Creamy silky body that’s easy on the tounge. Hoppy finish to close out this beer. Ya no kidding right? 8lbs per barrel so it better finish hoppy ;)"
"Looks perfect, gold hazy body that has a nice thick, creamy feel and light bitterness. Nose is fruity, taste is juicy as you would expect just from looking at it. One of the few that live up to the hype."
"Came across this one purely by chance recently, and was pretty excited to dig in..."
"Simple put this beer is perfection. Rich, creamy, smooth while bursting with tropical juice goodness. The balance is perfect which is what separates the truly elite beers above the rest. Wish is was available all the time...."
The Gold Standard Gulf Coast IPA
"Absurdly opaque yellow-tan with a minimal, bubbly white blanket."
"12oz bottle with a date that's hard to read but it's there and i'm pretty sure it says ""Manifested on 9-18-18"" (or something close)."
"merky af, sludge status. bright white head is fluffy and leaves some nice lace. pleasant aromas of lemon, grapefruit, mango, dankness, pine. palate follows with a candied fruit melange up front - peaches, orange, mango, grapefruit coming to mind. bitterness provided by grapefruity and piney bitterness on the back end, some herbaceous danky notes. the mouthfeel is thick, pretty fluffy but borderline chalkyness as it warms."

Serving: Can
A: Pours the usual dark-ish super hazy yellow color. The head is pure white and looks very creamy. Retention and lacing are pretty good. The look of the beer is 100% NEIPA.
Appearance is a nice amber with a slight white head. Aroma is a strong citrus with a tough of hops. The taste is also a fairly strong citrus with a touch of hops.

"Can. Full-on hazy peach color with frothy off-white head with very good retention. Aroma has overripe tropical fruits, juicy hops but also some more classic herbal notes. Taste has a biscuity malt base, even slightly nutty with the hops leaning towards the herbal and grassy side. Aftertaste lingers with grapefruit rind bitterness. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Extremely drinkable DIPA with no hint of the 8% ABV. It's not a juicebomb like other hazy IPAs these days but it's very hoppy and well put together."
"04/2016 - As much as I love Double Citra, this is next level - just a perfect representation of my favorite hop - Galaxy! From the nose, to the palate, to the finish, this ale crushes and is easy to crush, too, despite the ABV!"
From a growler picked up at the brewery today. Hands down the best use of galaxy hops I’ve ever had in a beer. The high ratings are spot on!
From can (2 weeks).
"Opaque pale yellow, almost like banana puree, with a large, off-white foam that settles in thick lumps to a fuzzy collar leaving pock mark lace on glass."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"You have to really like hops, but if you do, this is really tasty - sweaty socks and well-balanced, with no bitterness."
"08/2014 - Grapefruit, floral bouquet, hops up front; fruity, well hopped body with lingering peach, and a bit of pepper on the back of the palate; balanced, yet a wee bit of bitterness on the finish."
My favorite in a major blind tasting. So delicious.
"Smell, look, and feel are exactly what you expect from opaque NE-style IPAs "

Just so smooth.
"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a custom Sam Adams pint taster; canned on 9/14/18, code SO FRESH AND SO GGGREENNN."
"A bit more bitter than say... Double Sunshine, but great hop flavor. And a lovely mouthfeel. I think it's not so much that it's more bitter, as it has less of the citrusy complimentary flavor."
they cant all be home runs. This is a solid double to left....
Can dated 5-3-17. DFH Tulip.
"Loved it. Local Chicagoian schooled in hometown IPA's (3 Floyds, Pipeworks, Revoltion, etc.). This is Half Acre's best effort by far."
Thanks goes out to cavedave for this brew.
Beer pours a cloudy orange color with a thick white head. Lots of sticky lacing is left behind as well as a residual thin white layer of foam on top of the beer.

200% opaque dark orange mango and carrot puree with a tall off-white foam that settles to a frothy film and a lumpy collar leaving coral lace.
"Cloudy yellow with two fingers of creamy, off-white head. The head sticks around for a good while and leaves heavy lacing."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of pineapple, melon, kumquat, and tangerine. It tastes of pineapple, lemon, tangerine, and melon. The feel is light, and smooth. A nice ipa from Hill Farmstead."

"The lightly hazy golden amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1” fluffy white head that slowly recedes to eventually become a thin irregular island of foam on the surface and a ring around the glass while leaving scattered patches, some rings and a web of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates some small patches and legs of lacing."
A-Pours a nice slightly hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing
"Transparent golden in body with white giant head that stays. Aroma of dank ness, grass, pine, mint, citrus. Tastes of grass, pine, citrus, rind. Medium bodied with medium carbonation."
"Pours into a stemmed glass a lighter golden color with a billowing almost two finger rocky white head that takes it's time settling into a soapy mass leaving multiple chunks of lave behind.Mango,orange, and juicy papaya aromas,a hint of grapefruit rind to give it just a small amount of bitterness.Starts out juicy and bright on the palate with big orange and tangerine-like flavors then comes a mild grapefruit-like sharpness and a resin quality in a long lingering finish,just a fantastic hop profile.I thought this would be just a juicy NEIPA wich is not a bad thing but the hop profile was much more complex then that.Worth it's lofty status."

Had on tap at TH. As hyped... and one of the quintessential NEIPAs. This beer leaps with hop complexity and tasty bitterness. 
"This is one of my favorite beers in the world. When I'm sitting at work and thinking about coming home to my beautiful wife, my beautiful house, the dogs and the wood stove, this beer ranks high in the image. Amazing!"
The beer pours a pale orange/golden color with a two finger pillowy head that is tenacious. The beer looks thick and creamy. It clings stubbornly to the glass on each sip all the way to the bottom.
look: hazy peach or maybe orange juice with pulp. 
"In my very humble opinion, the best beer produced by this excellent facility. I have had many of the others, but here is perfection in a glass. Piney, resinous, tropical fruit. A hint of bitterness. A creamy mouthfeel. All in balance, all part of a flavor profile that will haunt you when you have none left."

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"16oz can. Pours a hazy burnt orange color with an inch of frothy head. Good deal of lacing. The aroma is citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple, peach and orange. Some dank/grassy hops also. The taste is more dank than expected but still has a good deal of fruit flavor. Mango, papaya, pineapple and peach. Bready malts towards the end with some more grassy and dank hops. Medium to heavy body with a bit of a dry mouthfeel. Good deal of alcohol warmth."
Canned on 10/9/18
"I found out I had a Treehouse beer and I got giddy like a schoolboy about to play in the dirt. My first Treehouse beer and the ratings on this beer is high. Let us get to the review. I love the label on this beer a black label with dark purple, way cool. The beer is 47 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The gentle pour produced a two finger bright white head. The head is creamy and airy with good retention. Lacing was left on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold with amber hues. Clarity of the beer is hazy from the yeast. Overall, a solid appearance for this beer. "
look: like peach orange juice with pulp I imagine. Sudsy plush head on the pour that mostly recedes.
Had a can thanks to Shawn. Overall Very good well crafted. Thought the tropical fruit tones were muted but complex and delicious. Very soft easy mouthfeel for a canned beer.
Reminds me a lot of other New England double IPA. The greatness of this beer is the piney smell as well as the hoppiness and long aftertaste. Reminds me of Heady Topper.
"Thanks to jlindros for hooking this up (and a bunch of other beers). Pours a hazy yellow with 1/3"" white head on the top. Aroma was citrus, didn't pop tropical fruit on this one, just seemed like a hearty dose of Citra hops and maybe just a drop of stone fruit aroma. Doesn't seem to be dry hopped any bigger or better than the big boys out here (Monkish/Cellarmaker/Moonraker/Alvarado/Revision) that make comparable stuff. "
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

"02/2015 - I get why this is hyped - it's quite good; but it isn't my favorite Bissell. There's a lot of onion, fruity hops, piney aromas; sweet, tangy, well hopped flavors with some caramel too; a touch bitter, earthy finish, with some melon hanging around back."

"Canned 10/30/18 ""NO TV AND NO BEER MAKE HOMER GO HAZY"""
Incredibly well balanced and smooth. I go back and forth on whether I like this more than Julius. Pretty sure Tree House can’t make a bad NEIPA. Well done!
16-oz. can 10/30/18 needed a medium-strong pour to get a finger sized foamy and creamy off-white head. Irregular spots of lace as the head retreats to a lasting cap.
Can dated 10/30:
A million thanks to Jon for this can of Haze. My very first.

"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Mosaic shines incredibly well all over the ale, namely the aromas; the hops work well with lactose on the palate, plus some peach supporting it nicely in back; thick mouthfeel, with juicy, peach qualities lingering."
After an earlier other half beer where the lactose was overpowering I was ready for disappointment. Luckily this is spot on. Malt and hops work well together and that big hop flavour and aroma is well matched with the lactose.
I've been on an Other Half kick recently and it's really kind of all running together. 
"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn. "
"A bit more bitter than say... Double Sunshine, but great hop flavor. And a lovely mouthfeel. I think it's not so much that it's more bitter, as it has less of the citrusy complimentary flavor."
they cant all be home runs. This is a solid double to left....
Can dated 5-3-17. DFH Tulip.
"Loved it. Local Chicagoian schooled in hometown IPA's (3 Floyds, Pipeworks, Revoltion, etc.). This is Half Acre's best effort by far."
Thanks goes out to cavedave for this brew.
Beer pours a cloudy orange color with a thick white head. Lots of sticky lacing is left behind as well as a residual thin white layer of foam on top of the beer. 
Pours a slightly hazy amber orange with a lot of white fluffy head.

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.

"04/2016 - This was a delightful mistake; huge fan of the combination of Galaxy, Mosaic, and Nelson to create a balanced juicy yet hoppy bite. Fruit for dayz!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

Thanks for the can Kevin!
"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold. Aroma of orange, pineapple and tropical fruits. Taste is well balanced with tons of tropical and citrus fruit. Orange, melon, mango, pineapple. Delicious"
"Pours a gleaming, turbid pale orange. Creamsicle like. Thick bright white head on heavy pour. Nose is packed with bright fresh citrus. Orange, grapefruit and lemon. Juice like if you will. Taste loses me a bit for one reason only, it’s hot. Really boozy is this one! There is tasty notes of citrus and hints of stone fruits along with sweet dough buried under all that boozyness tho. So I can’t too much. I just think it’s pretty green and it’s definitely a can you could sit on for a month in hops the heat is tamed. Thick creamy body with a hoppy hot finish. It’s hot!!! That’s all I got."

"Pours an opaque orange that turns into a murky burnt-orange when the final ounces are poured from the can into the glass. Head formation is pretty good, netting a finger and a half of white foam. Head has good retention. Aroma is orange peel, tangerine, papaya, lemongrass, and melon-dew. There is a light biscuit malt note, but faint compared with the onslaught of hops. Flavor profile is dripping with hops, without being very soupy or confused. Hops hit notes of orange peel, tangerine, mango, papaya, and lemon zest. Biscuit and bread malts form a firm foundation and actually show throw the dense curtain of hops, making for a well balanced DIPA. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a lightly grainy texture. Overall, a great double-dry hopped NE IPA, showing good balance despite having an absolute onslaught of hop notes from the get-go. Mouth feel is not chalky, which makes it much better than other well-known NE IPA producers' double-dry hopped offerings."
"01/2017 - One of the better Other Half IPAs I've had to date; combines the big ethanol quality of that I've come to expect from OH with the fruity, zesty, yet still hoppy qualities reminiscent of NEIPAs."
On tap at OH. Really enjoyed this one.

"No canned on date! Bummer, but It’s from the 8/11 release."
"This one pours a very hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
"Recently canned, and it feels even better than the one I had in the brewery on tap a couple of weeks ago. And it was the same batch. For some reason, I think individual cans are generally better than keg."
"DDH Double Mosaic Daydream has been on my wishlist for some time now - I was quite happy to try it when a fellow BA reached out to set up a trade. The cans were quite fresh - less than two weeks old - and the beer is tasting fantastic. Poured in to a teku, the color is a lovely golden orange with a thick white head. Carb is light and the mouth feel is very pleasant - just a bit creamy, quite rich, and the finish is decently clean. It's quite definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum, and once it warms up, and trace of bitterness virtually disappears."
"Pours a turbid orange creamsicle like with a thick white head on heavy pour. Nose is of a fresh cut fruit bouquet. Citrus and tropical fruits mingle in harmony with stone fruit ;) The taste of this thing is amazing! Papaya, mango, melon, peaches, guava, grapefruit and lemon. Did I miss any fruit? Almost has a orange creamsicle like quality to it minus the lactos or vanilla of course. Light breads malts balance this one out superbly. Medium to full body with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and smooth finish."
"Pours a murky orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, juicy hop notes, hitting orange, tangerine, papaya, mango, and pineapple. Biscuit and pale malts give it a little base, but overall the aroma is hops, hops, and hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, mango, pineapple, and tangerine. Big tropical fruit notes with solid pale and bread malts. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, lightly grainy texture that really makes this beer drink big. Overall, a heavy experience from this double dry hopped IPA. Tropical fruit notes are heavy and abundant, and yet well refined. "

"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
Thin feeling beer with very nice flavor. For me I get a lot of pine high is quite nice. Flavor is great for the thinness this beer has. Quality
"One of the prettiest beers I have seen in a while, this pours a hazy orange juice color with a nice two fingers of head. Head lasts a while before breaking leaving generous lacing. "
"drank from 12 oz can poured into tulip glass, a little over 4 weeks old--- no sign of weedy old hops, still very fresh tasting....delicious brew---nice balance of upfront fruitiness, pineapple mostly w a little grapefruit, followed by balancing mellow bitterness...Nice!"
"12/2013 - Big pineapple and orange nose, with some grapefruit lingering; large hop body with resinous notes dominating, and fruity grapefruit in the back; tangy bitterness on finish."
Serving: Can
"Almost fully opaque yellow-orange with a thick, convex white steamed milk-like froth settling in lumps with some spotty leopard lace."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.

"Opaque orange juice yellow-orange with a tall, slow to recede off white foam settling to a root beer float island leaving tons of lacing. "
L - pours a glowing early sunset yellow. Mild haze with a floofy head. 
"Canned 10/15, so one week ago. "
"Definitely the most unique presentation of Nelson I’ve had... comes through more citrus than white wine, with exceptional balance and perfect mouthfeel."
Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a strong grapefruit and hops. Taste is also a strong combination of grapefruit and hops that is slightly bitter.
"07/2017 - I've never experienced a beer so full of Nelson and enjoyed it so much! In fact, it's a tour de force of Nelson; creamy, juicy, tiny amount of vanilla; flavorful as all hell!"

Excellent IPA full of hop juiciness. Citra stand out enhanced with a very slight dryness/tartness likely from the drier Nelson. Subtle malt notes adding some biscuit and thread of caramel. Poured a beautiful merangue like head; stiff with soft peaks with great lacing. Pale soft slightly hazy orange. So remarkably smooth going down. Gentle and foamy on the tongue. A rather unique interesting IPA with its many subtle integrated complexities in an otherwise big Hop juicy brew. Would love try this one again...and again. Outstanding.
"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned 9/11/18, code WHEN YOU SMILE THE SUN IT PEAKS THROUGH THE CLOUDS."
"Can dated 9/11 from Sean (thanks!), so just over 3 weeks old. "
"Poured into a snifter. A bright yellow haze with a thick and resilient white head. Great lacing in the glass. White grape and tropical fruit aroma with a touch of resin. The taste followed with Nelson leading the charge. White wine flavor, dank resin, and tangerine on the finish. Pillowy soft feel. Outstanding."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"Pours golden straw.one finger white head. Nice lacing. Aroma pineapple and tropical fruits. Taste follows the nose with orange juice, peach and mango. Great collaboration."
"SO GOOD! I bought a couple of these 4 packs last time around! Amarillo, Motueka, Citra, Mosaic and Galaxy you cant go wrong!"
"Looked forward to this one big-time as I love both breweries that were involved in this collaboration. I was quite surprised at how high this was rated - not that this was a disappointment - but it just seemed to lack a bit of oomph to put it over to top. As it was, this beer was juicy, smooth, and easy to quaff...but in all honesty, would that really come as a surprise?"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

Honey was not a good thing in this one

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Pours hazy orange. Foamy, thick, tall white head that Fades slowly with lacing."
16 ounce can dated 9/12/18. Poured into Lexan tulip. 
Poured into a 12oz snifter glass via draft at Other Half
"Super cloudy, somewhat murky yellow with two fingers of off-white head. Soapy lacing."
Yup! Uber delicious
"All I can say is this is a great beer. Very orange-creamy, with some sweetness. It’s a lot like a milder version of Permuation 40, Trilliums creamsicle beer. It had a better balance of sweet and hope bite. Really good, another beer I can’t believe is so high in ABV."
"So good. A little sweeter than the ddh ace which i prefer, but for a 10%er, this is a master class in hidden abv and smoothness. a top notch triple ipa."
"16 oz can, dated 5/30/18, poured into a teku"
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.
Smooth tasty. Kicks ass
"Poured a cloudy yellow body with good head and lace sheath. Aroma has grapefruit and some light tropical fruit smells with little else. Smooth, clean, light body, there is a touch of floral crispness that keeps beer from cloying as beer is mostly a sweet, fruit beer. Finishes crisp/dry with well-hidden ABV."
Perfectly balanced and delicious!!
Solid. Balanced. Crusher
Perfect smooth double IPA not too heavy but full of flavor
This beer is the SHIT!! Hell Yes!!! 100% recommend!
Light & smooth for an IPA. Easy to drink! With an added slight fruity taste! Highly recommended!
"Very smooth great tasting double ipa, can’t even tell it’s a double. Pretty color and good smell. Would recommend to another."
Simply delicious!
Does NOT taste like what double IPA would typically taste like. Very smooth and full flavored with out the bite! Great after taste also
One of the best Double IPA’s I’ve ever had. I hope The Virginia Beer Company makes this every year!!
"So, the beer pours a rich looking, apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose, there's a huge aroma of mango, papaya, apricot and pineapple. The mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was also a bit less full than I was expecting, though I appreciate the fairly light, dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer. The finish is very clean in this beer, and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. So drinkability is pretty good. This is a very good DIPA for sure, though I don't think it quite matches up with the #7 version I tried last night. However, I think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this DIPA immensely. "
Look is a hazy orange color with a small off white head that is sort of thin and leaves quickly. Decent lacing.

"Huge frothy creamy head fades semi slowly with big soapy layered lacing, murky milk shake peach orange color"
Hazy as can be froth clinging to the side of the glass. Smells of stron fruit but not juicy like a lot of other NEIPAs. This beer is so smooth to drink!! Strong pungent fruit up front gives way to a little dank hop profile. The flavor lingers and makes me want to take another sip. Overall I highly recommend. I got this all from a 10 day old growler. I can only imagine it fresh.
Don't know where to start. I don't write reviews on beers typically but wanted to give this one a special shout out. Its a stand out beer for its style and probably the best I've had. Soft stone fruits through and through with a pillowy soft and full mouth feel. Don't really know what else is needed to be said.
"I love Pittsburgh brewery scene. So many great brews and probably the OG brewery of Pittsburgh turning out the best IPAs, is Brew Gentlemen. I have had the privilege to try a number of their brews, but have never had the chance to try any of their DIPAs. Whereas I feel General Braddock is a bit lacking, this brew is hits he hop profile perfectly. It is mango, pineapple, stone fruit bomb with a mild bitterness of a fantastic NE IPA. This is a king in a city of champions. It is on par with the top DIPAs in the style. Really love this beer and hope canning is in the future."

"One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience."
Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there.
"This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level. Phenomenal. Best trilltive ever and it’s not close."
"Can, Oct 2018"
Harsh and overly dank .. lot of hop burn and way too chewy ; Galaxy is overshadowed by the honey and this is

Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

Canned on 10/9/18
"Had this on 2018-10-31 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2018-10-09"
"Pours an opaque orange with nearly two fingers of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, papaya, pine, dank, and tangerine, mingling tropical fruit juice with biting Northwest hops. Wheaty, biscuity, toasty malts shine through in the middle. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, peach, pine, and light dank. Aside from the abundant hops, wheat and biscuity malts show through. Mouth feel is lightly effervescent with a chalky, grainy texture. It has a medium viscosity. Overall, flavorful and dense, bit less juicy and smooth from other Trillium offerings. "
"Looks great and smells OK but compared to DDH Fort Point this is kind of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Stillings Street, this was the worst of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!"

A bit too sharp for my taste
"10/15/18 batch, updated rating and review... .my Prior rating was 4.7, this was the first trillium beer I ever had and it opened my eyes to the unique flavors that hops can impart on a beer."
"Bright orange, sticky head. Smells like sweet orange, mango, pineapple, and dank hops. Tastes are the same as the scent with a great balance of sweetness from the fruit flavors and the bitterness from the hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel and hidden alcohol. Great beer."
"Another excellent beer from Trillium, this one pours a thick, hazy yellow and smells softly of stone fruits. To the tongue, the peach and nectarine are most prevalent, but there is a little more of a citrusy taste underlying it. The milky texture and grainy undertones prevent this from being too fruity."
"Wife Picked-up a four-pack at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty bucks. Guessing she didn't notice the 9+ ABV. Pretty smooth, considering the ABV, a bit dank, nice brew."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

"Upper Case pours a thick, murky orange juice yellow with a small, 1-finger ivory white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell has a big tropical fruit aroma with orange, mango and grapefruit with a big bite of danky hop resin. The taste is sweet candied fruit inducing pineapple, mango and good dose of citrus zest with a creamy goodness from the raw wheat. A complex bitterness creeps in finishing rather sticky. Overall, this is a very solid NE style DIPA. Another great beer out of Trillium brewing. Cheers!"
Thanks Kevin
"Draught pour at The Smoke Shop. Nose is mute (opens up a bit once warm) , but the taste explodes with tropical fruit, papaya, guava, passion fruit, mango, kiwi, and some faint citrus. Creamy feel on the tongue and swallow, some ABV burn that drys the palate. Damn delicious brew, just wanted more from the nose."
Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

Pretty solid beer! Nice hoppy taste to this beer! Had it in canned freshed and a pour that was stored for a few months in my cellar. Must admit this is an awesome brew; this brew has a nice Orange/Gold color to it; hoppy sweet smell; and some light foaming. Taste it smooth slightly carbonated feel to it but overall goes down smooth!

On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
"Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts. "
Possible that the new fermentation profile kind of ruined this beer for me.
Appearance: the body is a cross between baby yellow and tan. Totally opaque with haze with a 1-finger white head with good retention.
Very solid smooth IPA. Contains Australian galaxy hops with peach Clementine fruit and pine. Didn’t think it was amazing compared to other offerings like DDH fort point but solid.
"Tastes and smells like biting into a citrus fruit on a freshly cut lawn beside a copse of pine trees. Great mouthfeel, very drinkable. Enough bitterness to balance out the juiciness nicely. A stalwart in Trillium’s awesome lineup."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now. it may have been a game changer when it first came out, but it certainly isnt anything new anymore. this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere, and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic, more northwestern than southern hemisphere, but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away, which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa. it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry, while also being drinkable but substantial, round medium body but fast finishing, the right elements of the hops linger too, no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness. it does have some bitterness though, not all juice, and the grapefruity piney flavors, almost assuredly simcoe derived, do have some resolution, but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple, papaya, and juniper that turn me on here. so alive from the tap, almost chuggable for what it is, probably ahead of its time when it was introduced, not decidedly in the middle of whats hot, but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else, including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about. from a flavor standpoint, its great but not revolutionary, but through the lens of quality, its as good as it gets!"
"On tap Mission Dolores, Brooklyn. "
"Draught: this one pours a murky, golden color. There was a wisp of a white head and some lacing. Nice nose! Grapefruit, tropical and citrus hops. The taste is very good. A faint bitterness, and lots of juicy hops. They blend together to make something that is just excellent!"

"i was so stoked to try this after hearing and reading an awful lot about it, and maybe it didnt travel well to colorado, but i was somewhat unimpressed by this when i had it at hops and pie this week, its a tasty beer, a cool expression of the hops, sturdy and fresh and goof, but it really didnt stand out to me as overly high quality or anything. its rusty orange tinted without a ton of head and a hazy density to it, mucky even. the aroma might be the best part, cut tangerine and orange zest, heavier citra than we usually get, subtle apricot and peach, layered and interesting for a couple of hops i know pretty well. the flavor is good too, starting better than it ends though, fruity and bright up front, plenty of orange character, orange candy, lemongrass, and a little grain sweetness, this is a little bigger than it needs to be right away for me, like i would love to try the original instead of the double, it seems just a little forced. right past the delicious apex of this, it turns green and chemical, over hopped, bitey, less refined than the best of these are by a long shot, and i have no idea if its an age thing, a flaw, or something from transit, but it really makes this pretty hard to drink and seems a shame after such an enjoyable experience up until here. past the saturation point and then a bit bitter as a result, broken down and muddled compared to earlier on, and by the end of a glass, i dont want any more at all, and i am left thinking this isnt any better than anything we have locally here in the same style, and when i think about the ones i have loved from the likes of outer range, trve, and cerebral, i realize this isnt really worth the attention it seems to have gotten. cool that it came through here, but ill need to try it closer to the source i think to get a better feel for it..."
One of my favorites. Love this beer.
"L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a dark orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a 3/4"", foamy, very long-lasting head. Excellent lacing."
"Awesomely good NEIPA. Looks perfect. Big juicy tropical and citrus notes, My only beef is it has a bit of a bite to it. Other than that it's an outstanding brew."
"I've had Double and Triple. Same great taste as Triple Starfish without being such a heavy hitter. This unfiltered beer has a great mouthfeel, perfect level of bitterness."

A-Pours a hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing
"A little boozier than I like but, its a beautiful amber beer with a strong citrus and floral smell. The finish is dry and leaves a grassy aftertaste. For a traditional VT IPA this is delicious and strong!"
"DATE: September 23, 2018... OCCASION: sampling another of Jeff's Vermont pickups--FYI, this one is the 8% ABV... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours quite a bright, hazy lemon-yellow body alive with flecks of sediment and tiny, busy bubbles... its head is nearly four fingers of sudsy, soapy, cavernous white that caves in on itself while clinging to the glass--almost too attractive to disturb with a sip... prolonging that, first sniff is thick with juicy resin, lemon citrus, pineapple, mango, and papaya--despite the label, Crusher doesn't suggest any semblance of malt in its aroma... though I would have loved to experience this at 9.6%ABV, the 8% in my glass is plenty rousing, bitter, and Pavlovian in its mouth-watering trigger.... so much so, that the aftertaste lingers almost into its next sip, despite its dry finish.... medium-bodied but a live mouthful... the resin slays the tastebuds, massive and resounding with lemon, grapefruit and mango elbowing everything else out of the profile... light like a Belgian, sneaky with its ABV, great as a dessertif or a nightcap... one of the best one-dimensional offerings I have had, singular in its mission and massive in its effect...."
"Look - poured into an Alchemist IPA glass from a 16 oz can. Beer is lemon yellow in color, hazy, and has a beautiful three finger head with great retention and plenty of lacing. A real work of art."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

Not really understanding the hype behind this one. I think TG's Pompeii is actually a much better IPA. Here goes:
"Bomber from Tavour. Well worthy of its reputation. Hazy golden pour. Big airy, frothy head. Piney, hoppy aroma is followed by a luscious taste, creamy smooth and with a gentle bitterness. Heavenly throughout."
"Thinly hazed, lightly golden body; rocky, sticky, white head. Pine and spice aroma; a bit of tropical fruit juice. Intense combination of pine and hop bitterness flavors; a smidgen of orange and pineapple as well as some alcohol presence. Heavy body; rather sharp and prickly with the bitterness and ABV; semi-dry finish."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

"A bit more bitter than say... Double Sunshine, but great hop flavor. And a lovely mouthfeel. I think it's not so much that it's more bitter, as it has less of the citrusy complimentary flavor."
they cant all be home runs. This is a solid double to left....

"Had on tap. First Curiosity beer for me despite several Tree House trips. Pours hazy orange yellow in color with half inch head. Taste is citrus, starfruit, peach, melon, and bubblegum. Light bodied, slightly bitter and moderate carbonation. Amazing. Would get this if it were a regular offering. Has a Tree House taste but tastes different. A real treat."

Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"12oz bottle. Poured out a cloudy orange color with golden highlights and a small, off-white head of foam. It smelled of tropical fruits, orange peel and caramel. Bitter piney hop bite with grapefruit, mango and orange. Sweet caramel backbone."
Appearance - The beer poured the color of yellow Tang if such a thing exists. 
"Relatively fresh bottle from mid September that I received in a recent trade. Extremely murky and cloudy yellow but not at all dark. Aroma is kind of muted, citrus. Flavor is your typical citrus and fruit hazy IPA."
Bottled 5 weeks ago.
"An amazing double IPA without the overwhelmingly acidic, bitter, grapefruit taste. Exceptionally smooth with a unique & refreshing nose. Stands out in the crowd of IPAs and with an ABV of 8%, it packs a punch, but the flavor is uncompromised. IMO, THE BEST IPA I've ever had."
"Omg, this was so much better than I expected. It smells like pineapple and fresh satsumas--defintely tastes like some kind of citrus. At $4 a bottle, I was wondering how they got away with charging locals in Louisiana that much. I get it, now!"
"Appearance: Pours somewhat cloudy and in the orange direction of goldenstraw; the head builds to two fingers and retains until rocky, leaving a nice curtain of lace"
"Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter glass. Pretty excited to try this. So let's see! This beer pours out EXTREMELY hazy for not being the double dry hopped version. It's like juice and pale in color. It forms a one finger white and dense crown. I can smell juicy citrus notes as soon as I started pouring. Putting my nose to the glass, they become more prominent. Citrus juice with oranges, mango and even melon notes. The taste comes in with that juiciness as well but ends the build up and doesn't end up blowing me completely away but being very very good. This doesn't have that soft pillowy feel that most I've had from this style do. It seems to go in and cut straight through all the way instead of floating with softness. I do like it but find it kind of crazy that it's achieved this high of a status on here, but oh well! I'd get it again! And if they can make it like this over and over again with consistency, then that explains it!"
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Amber appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a slight citrus touch. Taste is a fairly strong hoppy with a slight touch of citrus.
Appearance – Hazy deep yellow body with a one finger head.
Great tasting beer. Goes down smooth. Very refreshing.
"Wow. Tropical paradise. Thank you Lord, thank you God. Say n'more,... nudge nudge, aye aye. Love it."
"Pours nice dark orange yellow. Good amount of haze with nice pillowy head. Nose is super ripe melon,berries with some minty scents coming through. Pretty dank. Nice! Mouthful is good and coating making the flavor profile all that much better. Front end palate follows the nose with nice ripe apricot and melon with flavors of berries , kiwi, and serious resinous mid to end palate blast leaves you rather stunned. The flavor builds throughout the sip and bitter dry finish is perfect. Flavor bomb with tons of tropical flavors make this amazing. A little more harsh on the palate than say, treehouse but every bit as good. This beer knocks it out of the park. Top of the line. Prob my favorite from this brewery. I need more!!!"
Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. Thank you Ryan for hooking me up with this one. 
Wow.

"On tap at Prison City Pub and Brewery in Auburn, NY."
"Revisiting this beer based on tasting notes, and I can't say that Paste Magazine's recent blind test (https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/247-of-the-best-american-ipas-blind-tasted-and-ran.html?p=4) does it any sort of disservice. Hazy orange, with a borderline pink hue. This is basically the beer version of Sunny-D. Big papaya, citrus, and pineapple aromas on the nose, followed by a massive punch of the same flavors on the body. Medium-bodied and satisfyingly drinkable. This is honestly the best beer that Upstate NY makes, and I'm proud to say that it's local. I hope that the folks at Prison City bring this one out year-round."

got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style."
"Poured into a snifter. Very hazy bright yellow color with a modest white head. Big tropical, grassy, and earthy aroma. Taste followed: pineapple, berries, mango, grass, and dank flavors. Smooth, full-bodied, and soft bitterness. One of my favorite TIPAs."
"Amazing Triple IPA! Definitely one of the best I've ever drank! I was able to try this from a pretty old can, and even still it was hazy and super delicious. Very lucky to drink an all-time great!!"

"Pours a murky yellow with no foam or head on the top. Aroma is huge citrusy orange with a tangy twist. Oats and biscuit malts firm up the background of the aroma. Flavor profile offers a little more diversity, hitting notes of orange, papaya, and mango. It still carries a tangy flavor. Biscuity, oat malts offer a little ground for the hops to plant their feet. Mouth feel is fuzzy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, a very good, citrusy IPA. Nice focus on one hop. "
Pours a hazy golden orange with two fingers of white head.
"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY"
"Beautiful and hazy. Smells like ripe oranges. Taste and mouth feel are wonderfully well-balanced - sweet, but not overly so. I kept thinking of Julius as I drank this, but it was without a doubt better than any batch of Julius that I've ever had. It finishes cleaner and has just the perfect mouth feel consistency."
"Head production is poor (but not non-existent); an increasingly turbulent pour - eventually just dumping in the last 1/3 of the can into an imperial pint-sized glass - resulted in perhaps one finger of white head. What did form, however, had good retention. The body itself is a peachy-orange color, pulpy and completely opaque, with some sediment visible during the pour."
"Holy handgrenade, that's smooth."
"Lot of great things going on here. Beautiful, hazy grapefruit in the glass, lovely citrus aroma, and a lightness that comes with oats. Then smoothed out by a little lactose and you have a creamy juicebomb that is flat out delightful!"
"Less than one week old, Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a pleasant smooth citrus. Taste is also a very pleasant citrus taste that is very smooth."

"Can. From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Really strong frutality and bitterness, with some milkshake ipa reminiscences. Good but didnt live up the hype, as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass"
This is a great NEIPA. Departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer. I appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off.

Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Posted a cloudy yellow-orange body with minimal head and no lace down the glass. Aroma has minimal sweetness with an earthy hoppiness to it. The beer has a sharp acidity to it in a light, juicy body, mix of citric and even lemon/orange sharpness, with a pineapple juice (almost tropical fruit) sweetness and sharp/sweet finish."
"Can shared a couple weeks ago not sure by who, but thanks"
16 oz can fresh
Appearance: Pours a murky honey color with a thick head that sticks nicely and leaves clumpy lacing
Bitter orange beer with moderate to light sweetness. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Very sticky head. Tastes fruity but there is a bitter orange baby aspirin finish. Tasty beer.
"Moderate pour yields a full one inch white head over a cloudy golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of sweet citrus (orange, ruby red grapefruit.) Taste of orange, orange zest, and orange pith in that order. Very nice feel in that it's a juice bomb very well carbonated. Overall, one of their best. Cheers!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."

"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"

"Thanks, Chris!"
First one from moonraker. I’m an instant fan. It hits on every note. Easily crushable. Extremely well balanced throughout. Look forward to more from them.
"Had this on tap at the brewery. Such an amazing beer! An easy drinker, lots of depth and isn’t overly juicy or bitter. Lots of citrusy orange, soft pineapple, grapefruit, and a touch of stone fruit."
"Lots of people will tell you in the ""Saa-kraa-menn-O"" area that this is the best of this style we have around here. And while they are right me personally am not as big a fan as most , a definite must buy if you see it or drive to Auburn and taste it yourself. You will appreciate this beer more if you had some wack ones of this genre. I'm not a person that's crazy about the haze."
Phenomenal beer. Highest recommendation. Look at the line around Moonraker when this beer is released and it should convince you I’m not alone in my rating. My wife was a Coors Light fan but Yojo has changed her life. She never liked the taste of any IPA and she absolutely loves Yojo.
"A glass of cloudy white grapefruit juice with a fluffy white head that fades but leaves a wind band of lacing. Bubbles continue to rise from the nucleation site of the glass throughout the drink. Nice scents of flowers, grapefruit, sweet malt and pine are noticeable. The taste is mostly bitter grapefruit pith and pine up front with a nice wave of mild sweetness and flowers at the end. Nice body and creamy mouthfeel in this beer. This is a really fine beer."

Simply outstanding DIPA. Smooth haze with tons of flavor and finesse. Love Galaxy hops and this one didn't disappoint! Big thanks to @leedszimbabwe for the hookup
Can from 10/6/18 release. Poured into Belgian tulip.
Pours hazy New England style ipa. Minimal head.
Poured from a 32 oz growler into a teku glass.

Tastes exactly like the juice box I used to have as a child. Wait.. was I drinking beer as a child?
Had from crowler from brewery on 7.21.18

"Perhaps the can I drank wasn’t the freshest, but this was a very good beer yet not a beer worthy of all the hype. It was smooth and tasty, but it didn’t blow me away and have those dank, super hoppy flavors that are normally associated with a beer of this stature. I’d love to try this again a week after the next release to see if it’s different."
"Pours a hazy orange with fine, soft head."

"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/20/2018. Pours opaquely hazy/cloudy golden amber/green color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, honey, biscuit dough, light nutty/toast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, honey, biscuit dough, light nutty/toast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, honey, biscuit dough, light nutty/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, fairly sticky, and slightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is an awesome NE DIPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Nice soft feel, not overly aggressive. Great Citra/Galaxy showcase. Very juicy and fairly dank/earthy hop complexity; nice bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. A really enjoyable offering and spot on style example."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
Awesome
My second Treehouse beer. It's really good. Lots of fruit in the mango variety with a light bitterness and a clean finish.
Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer is from July 2018 and has been in my fridge since purchase. Beer pours a murky goldenrod color with almost no light passing through the glass.
Consumed 10/1/18

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
A 1 pint can with no canned on or best before date. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.
"L - very hazy peach colour, nice white head"
"Pours a hazy orange with thick, creamy foam that leaves quite a lot of lacing."
"On tap. Herbal hop notes, dank, cheesy. Sweetish, hoppy, sweaty, dank hops, herbal bitterness on the finish. Medium body and carbonation. Citrusy hops, a bit astringent, dry, easy drinking."
It's better than the beer in your hand right now...
"L - Golden orange, murky body, finger of white head"
I really enjoyed this addition too the one series. They never disappoint. Big fan of sand city. They just keep upping their game. Look forward to more from them.
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
Like drinking a pine forest.
"Sap wasn't a good beer. I had this beer the first time it was released and it somehow was worse. It was improved greatly with sssappp. However, super sap is pretty bad."
"Pours an orange hue with a two finger had with lingering lace. Smells of citrus and pine, true to original Sap. Taste is sweet, crisp, a little soapy. Bitter and refreshing. Decently frothy mouthfeel."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a white head. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, fresh hops, and light malt. Tastes of very bitter/flavorful/fresh/dank hops, sweet malt, caramel, orange and grapefruit zest, dankness, and light tropical fruits. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible hop bomb."
"Yep, this is a hop bomb, no doubt about it. I didn't look at the IBUs on the bottle, but I'd guess about 100 or so. A check of their website upon writing this review yielded ""A LOT"" in the IBU category, so maybe I'm close. But as advertised, that's what dominates this beer. Good if you like the style."
A bomber with a packed on date sticker on the cap that reads 09/21/17. Pouring in a 12oz. tulip for the review. 
"Hazy gold color. Half-finger head that lingers and laces nicely. Lots going on with the nose. Strong scents of tropical fruit, floral, honeysuckle and mineral. Love the taste of this beer. Very well balanced between the hops and the malt. Strong flavors of pomegranate, pine, grapefruit and peach. Medium body. Nice medium-length finish coats the palate."
"Pours a cloudy gold with decent head and very good lacing. Nose is hoppy citrus with some floral tones and grapefruit. The taste is just awesome, very sweet hoppy goodness with a refreshing citrus mix, a little dry and very mild bite on the finish. I really enjoyed this beer, the hops were so tasty, just a juicy goodness."

The lack of bitterness is a detractor to me with the overall flavor profile being a bit too sweet. 9.3% abv is nearly undetectable - impressive."

"L - pours a sandy haze. Thick, flat, one hue. Yellow brown. Not much in the way of gradients. Sticky head that leaves nice lacing. "
"L - Light orange color, hazy body, finger of white head"
"Can from today's release, it pours cloudy gold color with a solid 2 finger foamy white head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating very slowly while leaving really nice foamy lacing with rings as it went down. As with all Sand City beers, this has the classic NE style IPA good looks, which I've come to expect from these guys."
"Can release today. 1/14/18Pours super merky. Big two finger white head. Nice lacing. Aroma of pineapple and tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose with tangerine, passion fruit, earthy tones, very faint booze,citrus and light orange juice finish. Great DIPA. Big fan of sand city. This one hits every note."
So much buzz about this one heading into the release I had to crack it first. Huge thanks to Dan for braving the cold and snagging me some cans.
Pours from the bottle a beautiful clear gold with a foamy white head that leaves lots of lace. 
"Appearance: pours a clear, dark straw color with a one finger, creamy, soft head that leaves a heavy residue of lacing."
"To me, this is just an awesome IPA and, to a degree I prefer it over it's infamous DIPA brother. It's an easier drinker and the hop balance is just perfect."
"Had on draft last week at Monk's in Philadelphia for about eight dollars. This is my second beer from this brewery. This is a very solid west-coast IPA, would love to try again."
"Had it on tap in Manhattan Beach California. Pours a straw color with a little foamy head that leaves nice lacing. This is a fairly light and crisp IPA, not the most interesting I’ve ever had, but clean and well done. The nose is not overpowering but consists of nice fresh hops with citrus, tropical herbal notes. Pineapple, mango, and other tropicals along with grapefruit peel and pine come through on the taste. I found it unexpectedly better. Others may not think it is so bitter; for me, 100 ibu doesn’t taste so bitter when balanced against heavy malt. In a lighter beer with a lower malt bill, even 50 ibu can seem like a lot. Such is the case here. It certainly grew on me by the end of the pint and I could see the relationship to Pliny the elder. I will look for it again!"
"Pours a clear dark golden straw color with thick white head dissipating into bubbly lacing. Nose is mild hops and sweet malt. Taste follows with mild piney hops, more malt backbone and slight bitterness. This is classic west coast IPA ,balanced and delicious.Not too hoppy , not too much alcohol. Maybe the bar for which to judge all others."
"Long-lasting, West Coast pine taste that doesn't quit. Simpler than the Plinys, but a classic single IPA."
L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a yellow-orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy head that lasted an average amount of time. Very good lacing.
"L - I do love this name! Pours a dull yellowy orange. Head dissipates quickly but leaves behind some nice lacing. Got some pretty serious legs here. Should be a fun one. Gotta say though, OG Fluctuation looked better!"
"7 days old when reviewed. Poured from 16 oz. can into District 96 tulip glass. It pours an opaque, almost murky, brownish-orange color with a thin cap of creamy, milk-white head and extensive, clinging lacing. It's a very attractive pour. On the nose there is lemon, lime, peach, some sweet tropical fruit, onion, mint leaves, pine, and a whiff of vanilla/lactose. There's not much hop presence in the smell. The taste is amazing! It's so nuanced. The first taste I notice is sweet tropical fruit and vanilla, much like Equillibrium's Fluctuation. Then, there is tart lemon and lime, followed by a dose of Citra and Galaxy hops that are delicate but very flavorful, without a strong bite. All of the flavors blend beautifully to create an overall delicious DIPA. This ale is creamy, full-bodied, with a near perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV is just enough to give it a real pop without being distracting. It's risky to try to merge two DIPAs as good as Fluctuation and Sexual Frustration, but Equilibrium and District 96 succeed beyond reasonable expectation. Sexual Fluctuation is a tour de force! I'm glad it is brewed periodically and I will always seek it out."
Crowler purchased at the source at last Saturday's release.
"This one pours a very hazy yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
chamomile and tropical--fruits--lychee on the nose.......Flavors move from cinnamon (none actually in there!) to key lime to lychee and tropical fruits...slightly sweet (more like fruity) and moderately sour...
Here we go again... Canned 2/22/18; reviewed 2/26/18.
"L - thick, cloudy, yeasty haze. Looks like the bottom of the keg, but that's what all TB DIPAs look like so I'm not (too) worried. Fine mist of a head with some nice sticky lacing. "
16 oz can from the brewery - drank about a week later. 
Can poured into a teku
On-tap at the brewery
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
"A: Fresh tangy citrus zest, coupled with sweet tropical fruit aromas."
"Poured this from a growler filled on April 18, 2018. 750mL fill."
Appearance: Arrives a cloudy goldenstraw color with a modest head; streaky lacing action
"Huge mango, tropical fruits, very hoppy"

Yeah. Really nothing to say other than this was extraordinary.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Juicy with mellow fruit notes, citrusy but also vegetal notes like chives. Light bitterness overall."

"Outstanding DIPA. Haze for days, and tropical fruits crushing the nose... gets a little ripe at the finish, but drinks so nice. Trillium consistently on point"
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a one pint can on May 14, 2018. An intensified version of Scaled. The secondary dry hop of El Dorado and Citra results in an enhanced nose of citrus, pineapple, and wet earth. The flavor brings intense lime, refreshingly pithy bitterness and just a touch of toasted malt. Medium bodied with a dry finish."
A - Pours a turbid orange with a very thin fizzy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.
16 oz. can dated 4/3/18. Poured into Carton dubvariant glass.
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

16 oz can with an August 2018 canning date. 
"Pours a turbid light straw yellow with a frothy white head on heavy pour. Nose is of fragrant ripe fruit. Citrus and melon. Taste is of sweet ripe mango, peaches, citrus pith and light pineapple. A nice bit of sweet dough and wet grass to help break up the fruitiness. Medium body, semi creamy with a dry finish."
"Michigan haze! Available at the grocery store, too. That alone is enough for me to recommend. I don't think I've seen any mass produced hazy NE IPAs at my grocery store. But... does it live up to the hype?"
"Now that NEIPA is its own category, I think I get it. And M-43 does a very, very good job of fitting the bill of the new category."

"When a beer is superb, my eyes tend to close to better experience great flavor. This one is an eye-closer. Looks so much like hazy, citrus juice in the glass, you almost expect to encounter pulp.

"Good, but disappointing. Consumed day of. Only tried 1 can, so maybe results vary depending on the can from same batch, which has happened more than I'd like from Tired Hands with other 4-packs in the past. No notes of vanilla, no matter how hard I tried to think."

That and the Azacca in the dry-hop dominate for my palate, beating out the citra and Simcoe. That said, this is a hop battle of the highest order, that ends up being nicely balanced and not at all overwhelming. This could just as easily be 7% instead of the 9.3% ABV indicated on the can."
"Canned 10.1.18, opened 11.5.18"
"4.5 across the board. A really nice representation. Pours a murky deep orange with a slight off white head. Nose is fruity. Aromas of tropical fruits and stone fruit. Taste is a beautiful thing. Sweet pineapple, lemon zest, ripe melon and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Enough doughy malt to break up the fruitiness. Medium to full body slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel. Hoppy non bitter finish. I dig it!"
Appearance is a very murky dark orange and poured with a finger plus of spongelike off white head. 
Thanks to superspak for this Michigan beauty.
Appearance - Pours completely opaque turbid yellow color with a huge soapy white head that leaves lost of sticky lacing all around the glass.
Fresh can poured into fluted snifter.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.

"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

"Like Alain Delon in Le Samurai, this dang thing is smooth! Very dry and pithy. Kind of lacks in the after taste like a Stormy Daniels quickie. Good nonetheless."
A draft pour at Burial Brewing Asheville.
Honestly one of the best NEIPAs I've had. The Mosaic hope is truly the smoothest and creamiest hop for sweet delicious beer. I have maybe 30 different OtherHalf beers and this is there best one. I probably even think it's better than the DDH version.

"Canned 10/04/18, it pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 1-2 finger thick foamy off white head that faded slowly and left excellent lacing coating the glass, looking like a snow covered window in a blizzard. Three is as handsome as One and Two, so Sand City cranks out near perfect looking anniversary DIPA's or NE style IPA's, either category applies."
The beer pours a very nice white foamy head that dissipates quickly but leaves a good looking ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a good looking opaque and hazy moderate orange color to it. It looks really nice.
"On draft. Served in a goblet glass. Pours a creamy, hazy golden yellow body, slightly brighter than Sensei side by side, one finger white head, lots of retention, bits of lacing. Looks great. Smell is rich grapefruit, creamy sugar, citrus zest, touch of pine resin, caramel, mineral. Flavour is better than it smells, at least at first. Very hoppy grapefruit sweetness, bit of resinous pine bitterness at the end with a small amount of sugar and caramel in the middle, and a zestiness throughout. Good NE IPA character, with big aromatics coming across on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, soft and creamy, mild-moderate zesty bitterness supplanting the resin on the backend. A really very nice DDH IPA, lots of hop character comes across on the palate here."

"A- Tallboy into a narrow becher with a hazy, kinda cloudy pale golden body and a three finger foamy-creamy white head. The cap shoots up fast but falls slowly with great retention. Thick webs of lacing off the glass a few mm and the pillow stays around throughout the entire experience."
"16 oz. can. The first 75% of the can pours hazy orange and then the last 25% pours like I just added orange sherbet to my glass. Smells of tropical fruit, sweet citrus, mango. Tastes of mango all over. Light citrus pith at the fringes. Sweet juicy backdrop. The pith flavor is the only source of bitterness. Thick and creamy texture. This is delicious and I am fully aware that in most other circumstances I would find a beer like this to be undrinkable."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
A - Opaque light orange tan color with thin lacing and no carbonation.
"From a 16oz can, dated 10/01/18. Served in a spiegelau-style IPA glass."
Appearance: Arrives cloudy with a pale orange cast topped by two fingers of foam; good lacing action
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/17/2018. Pours very hazy/cloudy golden orange/amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, strawberry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, strawberry, citrus peel/rind, light pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, orange juice, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, strawberry, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, fairly sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mildly increasing warmth of 11%. Overall this is an awesome NE DIPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the ABV, with the melloely bitter/drying finish. Nice soft feel, not overly aggressive. Awesome Citra/Mosaic showcase. Very juicy and fairly dank/earthy hop complexity; balanced bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. Was surprisingly lightweight for the 11%. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma has dank, sweaty hops and milky yeast notes. Taste is sweet and malty but clean with lots of fruity hops. Sweetish, intense and a bit warm from the high ABV."
"Canned 4/17/18, poured 5/27/18. Dark, murky orange in color. Nose is somewhat sweet, somewhat malty, with notes of orange, grapefruit, and canned peaches that were maybe just a little too ripe. Flavor is sweet, resinous, and dank, with more of that sugary peach syrup vibe. Carbonation is very light. The alcohol is very present, but less in the form of burn, and more in a way that makes you feel like you're drinking a stiff mixed drink; it somehow merges with the flavor. By no means one of those ""can't believe this is a TIPA"" TIPAs. Big, heavy, and enjoyable if that's what you're in the mood for."
"Pours a turbid orange to copper with a thick off white head on heavy pour. Nose is citrus forward with a mix of floral and malt. Taste is pretty citrus driven. Orange peel, grapefruit pith and lemon zest. Some light mellow mango in there as we’ll all on a sweet dough maltiness. Some grasses and very light hints of floral but this really is a citrus bomb. Huge creamy mouthfeel, silkiness to it. Hoppy bit to finish. A bit boozy particularly when she warms."
"The body has a nice medium orange look with a good yellow hue to it. The smell consists of a nice, mainly dry hop grassy pine bitterness with some moderate grapefruit. The taste has a slight sweetness in the taste and an alcohol note that runs through it among the grapefruit notes. It has a heavy body but slightly creamy but more smooth, which makes it pretty drinkable."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

"Wonderful New England style dbl IPA. I gotta be thinking that Foam has to be a destination brewery. I can make a case for up there with Trillium and Treehouse. Not on par yet and maybe never but what I have had from Foam compares. This Built to Spill is superb. I am not good at all the ratings with individual stuff. I just know when I have a decent beer, or a good brew and certainly when I have a a mouth feel and taste like this. Exceptional. I just wish I lived in the area and am great full for a friend who brings me some when he visits me in Maine."
"First sip was just meh, but as this opens up it.is truely amazing. There is a more floral note than you see in many NEIPA and an acidy that enhances the citrus hop notes. Really brilliant.combination."
"Pours a hazy light straw color. Nice citrusy aroma. Unique hop flavor here - slight pine, ample cirltrus, and floral. Nice. Carbonation lends itsself to its creaminess. Overall a cool brew, very enjoyable."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Straw color. Great nose of hops and citrus. All encompassing mouth feel. Serious hops intensity. Big brother to hurricane. An upgrade over the regular typhoon.
"Canned 11/1. Gorgeous looking NEIPA as you’d expect from Tree House. Lots of head that sticks around a bit after an aggressive pour. I’m surprised I don’t get as much of a smell as I do from some other super fresh NEIPAs. A bit more bitterness than some super juice bombs I’ve had, and I like it for that balance. Pillowy soft mouthfeel. I’d definitely get it again!"
"Picked-up six cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton on Saturday, canned-on date of 11/1/18. This is my 21st brew reviewed from these guys. Decent, but not one of my TH faves, dank smell, a bit of a bland taste."

"I received this beer from a recent BIF. I never heard of this brewery and my first Vermont beer. The temperature of the beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The hard pour on the beer produced a two finger head with lousy retention. The white head was airy and creamy. The head dissipated quickly leaving no lacing on the glass. A thin ring is all that remains in the glass. Colors are a medium gold with amber hues, SRM 5. The haziness in the beer produces no clarity. "
Poured from the can into a tulip.
"Tall can, from the source a few hours ago. Canned 8-30...2 days ago"
"Nice hazy, bright orange color with a finger head. Not much lacing on the glass. Some dank aromas with fresh citrus and papaya. A bit on the dry side with some hop bitterness, slightly tart citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Medium body feel with good amount of carbonation. Has a nice spicy finish and lasting hop flavors."
"This is an amazing DIPA that is well balanced, bitter but not over the top, juicy but not overly so, but at the same time it doesn't have the crazy wow factor. But I think it makes it pretty drinkable."
Absolutely amazing NEIPA. 
A: Poured into a tulip glass to a hazier than hell yellow topped by a finger of dense white head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
Pavement - Foam
"16 oz can, dated 6/21/18, poured into a teku"
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."
"Tropicalia 12oz can poured int Duvel tuplic. ON 07/11/18, BY 10/09/18 stampd on bottom of can."
Out of a can at Max Lagers poured
"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.

"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
I was lucky enough to sample this at a festival in Boston. This is the standard by which I compare all other beers.
"Definitely a solid IPA. Extremely well balanced. Hue is orange, and taste carries hints of citrus and pineapple. Very drinkable beer at 10.5 ABV. My tasting notes are based on a keg event in Philadelphia."
The hand of god has came down to a certain individual and said make this and you will win. Nothing more to say than this is godsend. 4.75 on the nose cause nothing is perfect.
"Tasted from draft. Checking off a whale. Pours a partially cloudy gold. Aroma is piney, medicinal, floral. Moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of pine, resin, citrus, herbal and earthy. Complex and goes down super smooth. Awesome imperial ipa."

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
The pinnacle of West Coast style... Enough said.
Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco.

"12oz can from the brewery. Pours a murky dirty brown color with sediment floating around and a thin layer of head. No lacing. Sweet aroma of pineapple, pink grapefruit, lemon, pine, orange and starbursts. The taste is pineapple and grapefruit followed by some floral hops and some slightly sweet fruits near the end. Piney, herbal finish with a bit more grapefruit and some dark bread and honey. Tastes about as boozey as expected. Medium to heavy body with low carbonation and an oily mouthfeel. Worth seeking out."
Well craft and easy drinking for the strong abv. Prefer Double.
A-Pours a very nice orange amber color with a slight head and lacing
Murky orange with two fingers of antique white head that has decent retention and leaves thick webbed lacing.
"The beer pours a some what hazy yellow with a big white fluffy head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of citrus, lemon, dank herbs, and orange peel. It tastes of lemon, citrus, orange peel, dank herbs, with a bitter bite. The feel is full. A great IPA from Lawson’s."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."

"Had a pint of this poured from the draft tap at Agava on East Hill, Ithaca, NY. Holy smokes! What a delicious brew! Lovely slightly turbid lupulin particulate opacity, good head retention, superior mouthfeel. Bittered enough though featuring floral, fruity, complex hop aromatics. Bartender made sure to note that this great ale was not included in the Happy Hour discounts, but who could complain as long as it still poured for us? Definitely a great IPA! And brewed just 265 miles from here!"
Can dated 10/5:
This is significantly overrated in my opinion. It smells nice and all but is not as pleasurable to drink as similar beers this highly ranked. The first sip is nice but flavors get muddled and it can't decide if it's going to end crisp or fruity hazy lingering and that holds it back. 
"Second attempt at trying to understand all the attention and praise being paid to this beer... and it has underwhelmed me yet again. It smells better than it tastes, very true to fresh lupulin like when u crack open a hop bud... but not that strongly. Its more bitter than i remembered but there isnt the fruitiness others rave about. Its light for an 8% but its light in flavor too! My Cans are fresh... I dont know, folks, to me this is perhaps the most overrated beer in existence today. I. Dont. Get. It. And the price point?!! This is the product of pure hype."
Best beer I have had. Would love suggestions for similar beers.
"This is a super solid DIPA. The smell is bursting with dank sticky hops, over ripe fruits, and a hint of honey sweetness. The taste is balanced leaning towards hoppy with firm bitterness. This is what a DIPA should really be. yb"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
It’s pretty much old school west coast IPA at its citra finest....
"Well, here is it: other than Emily Didonato lying at the foot of my bed - this is my number 1 want: Kern River Citra."
Awesome!
Great beer with the creepiest finish. Amazing from the bottle but best on tap.
"Surprised by the haze, it's a nearly fully opaque orange-amber with a lighter gold around the bottom edge, topped with a large khaki foam that slowly settles to a thin film with a bubbly clinging collar."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."

"10/2015 - huge hoppiness, tangerine, big malts, ethanol on the nose; dank, pine flavors pair nicely with more tangerine, orange zest; surprisingly dry, lightly bitter finish, with a touch of heat in the back. I like this more than Pliny the Younger for sure."

"Love this beer. Just had another 22 oz. bottle. Great color, great hoppyiness and easy to drink. I will buy it whenever I see it at the beer store."
Pine and tropical fruit on the nose. Feel is very creamy. Tons of hops on the fron and back.
"8/1/18: $12 22 oz bottle purchased at Three Floyds Munster, two pours into pint glass. Orange pour, thin white head, heavy carbonation. Strong citrus lemon hops aroma. Very strong dry taste and mouth feel, excellent hops blend, balanced with citrus. Drinks smoother and easier than the strong ABV. Solid mouth feel, bitter, carbonation and dryness holds, Overall excellent offering, worth the trip to Munster!"
"5 ounce pour at 3 Floyds in Munster. Nice dark golden orange colour with fruity aroma - grapefruit, hoppy resinous, a little floral. The taste starts more with a sweet malt followed by big citrus notes then pushing into piney flavours. Full bodied mouthfeel to a well balanced finish - pleasant but not over the top bitterness for a 100 IBU beer. Fantastic."
This is my most favorite beer. It is very smooth with fruity overtone. A beer with a much higher alcohol content and should not be drunk quickly. If you can find this beer anywhere (it's a rarity) enjoy!

"this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence..."
"Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus. On the tongue is delicate but flavorful west coast style zesty hops, piney and citrusy with a light bitterness on the finish. Moderate malt backbone. Smooth and easy, especially for 9%"
"Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant. Taste is citrus up front with mid sip malt and finishes piney. Feel is relatively viscous for a DIPA. I love this! Overall, an excellent west coast DIPA. Very smooth for 9%!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.

had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."

"Pours golden orange with thin head, nice lacing . "
Appearance - The beer poured a golden yellow color with a white head.
Best part of this beer is the creaminess. Very dank on the nose and finish.
"Fairly fresh, aquired in a trade. No bottling date."
"16 oz. can. Pours murky orange with a tan head. Even the foam looks murky. Smells of orange and lots of fruit. Mango and papaya and all that. Earthy notes behind it and a tinge of cat piss. Tastes of sweet pale malt, orange, and strong papaya. A bit of bitterness and that earthy flavor kicks in in the back end. Medium body and even a little chewy. Something kinda funny about this one. I think I enjoy it, but I'm not all that enthused."
Growler from the source. 
"Pours a hazy bold orange with a two finger head. Smells of citrus juice, rain water, and a little peppery. Taste is sweet juice, pineapple and mango, into a light subdued bitterness. Leaves behind the same initial juice blast that it starts with. Feel is smooth, drinkable and approachable. Overall, a very nice Trillium IPA. Hope they brew it again."
Appearance: Murky / turbid golden orange body. Thick bone white head. 
"The beer pours a hazy orange with a big white fluffy head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, lemon, cantaloupe, and melon. It tastes of orange, lemon, cantaloupe, and melon. It has a full body with subdued bitterness. A good IPA from trillium."
"The Permutation #38 pours an eggy yellow with not much of a head, and its citrusy smell only slightly more of a creamsicle than the creamier #39. It tastes like soft tangerine layered with delicate hops, a fluffy beer that still manages to tread the fine line between bitter and sugary well. Its soft consistency is almost unparalleled among beers, without it feeling particularly thick or heavy."
"Dated 5/16/18 on the bottom of the can, 8 days since brewing."

"L: Dark gold color with a good amount of off -white head. The lacing is crazy on this thing, it clings to the glass for days."
"Bodhi is only my second of the Top 10 rated IIPAs. I am neither a fan of the style, nor the hype around it."
"Pours a deep amber and a reasonable head, decent lacing."
The best of the 4 beers I tried from this company. Hazy color. Tropical taste. Lots of papya and grapefruit. Finishes Crisp and juicy and overall good feeling
"Bodhi brewed by Columbus Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.50% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint beer glass a nice golden amber color. There is also a nice white head on top of this brew with a nice amount of lacing. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, a slight citrus flavor, with earthy grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Bodhi. So far this is a nice inviting brew, now for the taste. It is rich and bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness with citrus flavors. The body of Bodhi is a medium to heavy but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. It goes down this smooth, the citrus flavors are a nice touch to this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold ,Rich, Clean , Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Bodhi a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Columbus Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA."
Wonderful balance of malt and citrusy hops. Attractive on the eye with a golden color with white head that rescinds into nice lacing. Remarkable is the mouthfeel - super easy to drink and masking its DIPA qualities. Citrusy on the nose and palate. Wonderful beer.
"A wonderful full flavor , earthy , multi-layered beer. Pours a Beautiful deep copper with a thick off white head. Mostly a deep earthy smell with some citrus , flower undertones . Fills the mouth with flavor but is still somewhat subtle at first taste and isn’t overwhelming . Keeps you curious for the next taste . A great beer"
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy golden color. Aroma has sweet vanilla malt and tropical juicy fruits. Taste has soft fruity hops, melon, mango and a bittersweet hoppy finish."
Canned 04/11/18 ‘SMALLS’.
Very smooth for over 10% ABV.
A: Opaque light orange with a frothy white head. Like a straight up Orange Julius!!!
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.
"4 pack Whole Foods in Cleveland. Pours a clear orange/light copper colour with limited off white head. Aroma dank piney, citrus, slightly floral, creeping into sweaty, but deliciously so. Taste starts sweet for a millisecond before the pine bitterness slaps you with a sticky resinous blast on the back of just a touch of caramel malt. Finishes slightly sticky with palate coating bitterness that warns against consuming anything else for a while, yet not a punishing bitter, a wondrously tasty one! Absolutely great."
Poured into a snifter.
A great beer tastes great
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"

From a 16oz can from 9/18
I wouldn’t describe many double IPAs as crisp but this beer is crisp and delightful with citrus hints and a nice hoppy bite.
16 oz beer poured into a nonic pint glass canned on the 9/18.
"Six weeks from canning... Orange haze, perfectly uniform throughout, nice lacing. Smells like melons, taste is a little more piney/dank than expected, but it works nice. Good feel, nice brew"
On tap at McGillicuddy's
"Almost clear golden color with off-white head. Aroma has resiny, piney hops with a sweet malt background. Taste starts bitter upfront, slightly astringent, quite harsh and resiny. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. I expected much more from this one considering the hype but it's a quite basic DIPA with intense bitterness and not much complexity."

As a stand alone this beer was solid but sometimes you just have to blend you own beers and these Curiosity Fourty Four really enhanced the beers they were mixed with.

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"L: amber gold with a light haze under a 1.5"" white blanket of foam"
"A: The beer is quite hazy yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving a narrow collar around the edge of the glass and some lacing down the sides."
"Between MN distribution & a good trading partner, I’m rapidly becoming a huge Pipeworks fan. This is the latest 22 oz. bomber to show up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Split with my wife. "
Pours a slight hazed golden color with a white head. Smell had citrus and mango. Taste was fruity with alot of mango the honey muted the mango puree is a good way very tasty. Slight bitter mouth feel with a pine like feel had and orange and mango finish.
"White head. Lace. Golden orange color. Clear, not hazy. "
"Pours an almost clear only slightly hazy amber/orange with a huge pillow of white head that sticks around and leaves fabulous lacing. Aroma is sweet ripe tropical fruits. Flavor is honey and fruit, no bitterness to speak of. Feel is thick for the style with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall a nice beer that (IMO) needs a little more bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness of this beer."
"Features honey and mango puree, and Citra and Mosaic hops..."
"It's funny to me that this is one of Pipeworks' highest rated beers, while their stouts haven't made top 250 - funny how the world spins."
Pours an effervescent honey color with a thumb+of eggshell colored head. Great lacing & head retention
Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Teku.
Lots of honey. Alcohol is hidden but I can feel it after half the bottle which I like. Worth getting and will buy again.
"There is a reason Beer Connoisseur rated this one so high. I am not big fan of IPA; but this one is excellent! Pours a pale gold with a slight haze and nice head. Lots of interesting aromas - tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Goes down smooth and crisp. Has a nice snap of bitterness at the end, but not offensive or over done. Short aftertaste. If you are not a fan of IPA but still trying to find one that you like. Try this one, you will not regret it. Top of my IPA list."
"Met one of the guys who opened the brewery randomly in FL. Him and his girlfriend gave me their last can to try as we couldn't get it in JAX. Just awesome, smooth, crisp and easy to see why it flies off the shelves in GA."
"Tired it multiple times and have failed to be impressed. Don't know if my taste buds don't work but it does not,do it for me. Had other ""fruity"" IPAs that I prefer."
"Tropicalia 12oz can poured int Duvel tuplic. ON 07/11/18, BY 10/09/18 stampd on bottom of can."
Out of a can at Max Lagers poured
"Another great Georgia IPA, a definite NE Style IPA. Hops and Malts are balanced. Smells of tropical fruit, taste follows. Followed by a somewhat piney slightly bitter tale. Another Classic, extremely hard to differentiate a clear best IPA in this state."
"A: Pours with a creamy, off white, three finger head and a clear, straw gold body."
12 oz can dated 6/13/18 poured into Funky Buddha snifter. 
"4.1/5: Wonderfully drinkable and easy, yet bursting with tropical flavors the same; would be a go-to if I can find it more easily"
poured into pint glass very light nice golden color nice bit of head that quickly turns to very light lacing around the glass heavy tropical fruit and citrus on the nose flavor is very tropical and citrus that has just a very pleasant light hoppy bitterness in the finish this is definitely a top 10 IPA an absolute beauty
This beer is perfection. So thankful the ATL area shortage is over.
"From a 2-week-old can, pours a moderately hazy gold. Two fingers of white foam leaves decent lacing. Smell has tropical fruit, citrus, earthy herbs and a touch of pine. Taste follows, combining fruity hops with some resinous pine. Moderately bitter, good body. Fantastic stuff, nice to have so fresh."
Thankfully this beer is widely available for me. Big juicy tropical aroma and the taste follows perfectly. This is a seriously good IPA. One of the best.
From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This nice IPA from the little lady's daughter and beau
My favorite summer time beer!
Acquired via trade. Can date of 2-8-18
Very tasty! Reminds me more of a NE IPA! I see why it is the top rated IPA from GA and was rationed.
"Poured from can into tulip good 2+ finger cream colored head, stays several minutes and reduces to 1/2 finger, great lacing. Pale golden in the glass, slight chill haze. Smells of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, smells really bright and tropical (like the name). Taste is initially pineapple and sweet malt, slight bitterness on the front and the grapefruit comes in thru the middle, strong grapefruit, good grapefruit, finishes fades off with a very mild bitterness, and am left with a grapefruit pith aftertaste (not in a bad way). Almost a creamy mouthfeel, on the first taste."
"Tropicalia came to me as part of a NBS box, and it was (as of yesterday evening) my favorite Creature Comforts beer thus far. It was unseated this morning by a blind tasting of Awaken, My Love - but per style, Tropicalia is still my favorite Creature Comforts pale."
Appearance is a somewhat cloudy dark orange. Poured with 2 fingers of white head.
"My favorite from Monkish, after 40+ beers from them tried."
"Wow, best hazy triple ipa i have ever had. So flavorful with the galaxy presenting a tropical fruit cocktail juice bomb. Mouthfeel is so creamy and delicious no bitterness at all and well hidden alcohol taste at 10%abv crazy. I know its super limited if your lucky enough to have tried this consider yourself fortunate. Glad i got 6 cans to go."
A 16 fl. oz. can with no canned on or best before date. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.
Well if that ain't something!
"Slightly hazy golden color with off-white head. Aroma has herbal hop notes, orange rind and a light astringent fermented fruit note. Taste has oranges, tea notes, leafy hops, medium herbal bitterness on the aftertaste. Medium minus body and carbonation."
"Pours a fairly clear orange, with soft, thick foam."
L - 1/2 finger fleeting offwhite head atop a translucent orange body.
"L - pours a startlingly clear amber orange! What happened to the swamp water NEIPA?! Big fluffy head that leaves behind craters of giant bubbles and inconsistent, sticky lacing. "
"A- hazy gold, half inch white head"
Pours dark orange and haze. Aroma is straight up orange juice and feels so creamy. This is all Mosaic all the time. Loved the taste and aroma. Really nicely balanced without being overly potent on the orange notes.
"Appearance: With a nice bubble show, the head builds to two fingers above the hazy honey colored liquid; nice stickage and a patches of lacing"
It is like a hoppy dole fruit cup. Very balanced. Extremely drinkable with NO alcohol taste what so ever. I just wish it was a tad more hazy looking but all in all a perfect beer!
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"Canned on 02/20/2018. Wow this beer did not hold up well. I got a 4 pack when it was released and found this guy in the back of the beer fridge. Floaters like crazy. Taste is off. This beer 2 months old is a 3/5. But I know I loved the other 3 cans, so I’ll give it the rating it deserves. Just don’t drink this thing old."
Can from Byronic
Hazy mustard orange-yellow color with a finger of white head. 
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick.

"This the first beer I’ve had from Sand City. Came in a 5oz pour as part of a flight at the brewery. Had a beautiful, hazy orange hue, smelled of tropical fruits and citrus. Immediately hits you with the tropical fruit once you sip it - big papaya/guava/mango flavors up front thanks to the Galaxy hops. Probably the best thing about this beer, though, is how ridiculously smooth it is at 8.2%. Big hops and bitterness are there, but toned down to a pleasant point. Definitely a new favorite of mine."

"L - love the name. Pours a soft, gentle haze like pineapple juice. Quickly dissipating head that leaves sticky lacing behind."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a white head. Smells of tropical fruits, citrus, fresh hops, and light malt. Tastes of very bitter/flavorful/fresh/dank hops, sweet malt, caramel, orange and grapefruit zest, dankness, and light tropical fruits. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible hop bomb."
"Yep, this is a hop bomb, no doubt about it. I didn't look at the IBUs on the bottle, but I'd guess about 100 or so. A check of their website upon writing this review yielded ""A LOT"" in the IBU category, so maybe I'm close. But as advertised, that's what dominates this beer. Good if you like the style."
A bomber with a packed on date sticker on the cap that reads 09/21/17. Pouring in a 12oz. tulip for the review. 
"Hazy gold color. Half-finger head that lingers and laces nicely. Lots going on with the nose. Strong scents of tropical fruit, floral, honeysuckle and mineral. Love the taste of this beer. Very well balanced between the hops and the malt. Strong flavors of pomegranate, pine, grapefruit and peach. Medium body. Nice medium-length finish coats the palate."
"Pours a cloudy gold with decent head and very good lacing. Nose is hoppy citrus with some floral tones and grapefruit. The taste is just awesome, very sweet hoppy goodness with a refreshing citrus mix, a little dry and very mild bite on the finish. I really enjoyed this beer, the hops were so tasty, just a juicy goodness."
"They need to brew this regularly, absolutely delicious!"
"L - now that is some straight mango juice. Goddamn that glows beautifully in the evening sun. Creamy, oily head. "

Pile of crowns... wish they had it more often. Really special brew from a fantastic brewery. These guys are on the cusp of becoming one of the most sought out beers of the east coast. Phenomenal fluid.

"The beer pours a murky yellow with a medium sized white head. It has low carbonation. It smells of orange rind, mango, melon, and white peppers. The beer tastes of orange rind, mango, melon, and white peppers. It’s full bodied with no bitterness, but quite boozy.

On tap at Burial Beer Co. in Asheville. Interesting to find something from Other Half this far south and they did a collab with Burial on another beer called Sangies.
"Pours a very cloudy yellow gold color with a one finger head. Aroma is pungent with grapefruit and lemon notes. Taste is similar but a pineapple note that come through in the finish. Really fantastic combo. Malt is light and bitterness is light to moderate. Feel is very smooth and creamy, hence the ""oat cream"" designation."
Trying to get caught up on ratings.
"Bought this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 4/28 with ""WET DREAMS"" (really?) written above it. Uncomfortable feeling aside, this was an amazingly smooth beer that was taken to the next level because of the addition of lactose from the Daydream in Green. It didn't feel like there was any alcohol in this as the sweetness and fruit flavors took hold from the get-go and never let go!"

My second favorite of the Society and Solitude series 7-11. A solid offering for lovers of IPA. New Zealand based hops prevelant in this brew. Drinkable.
Bought in cans a few months back it’s criminal that I just opened my first! If they’ve fallen off at all they must be unbelievable fresh because I can’t find anything wrong with this!
Very smooth. Pillowy soft body. White grape and light citrus notes on the nose. Balanced sweetness with only a hint of bitterness on the back end. Easy drinking DIPA.

"Almost fully opaque, except around the edges, this mainly displays hues of orange and light accents of yellow, and is topped by a moderate to large beige foam leaving some solid layers of spongy lace on the glass."
"Good looking IPA, lots of legs with a thick white head. Smell was wonderfully hoppy, but was missing something. Taste was perfectly hoppy, slightly tart and malty that was just wonderful with a tremendously smoothe drinkable feel."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."

"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
Hazy really pale yellow color with white head. Aroma has dank and earthy hop notes with some slightly spicy malt notes. Taste is grassy and herbal with a medium bitterness and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Quite good but not really up to the hype.
"A: Yellow, cloudy, white head, not murky yeast slurry!"
Poured from a 12 oz can into an Alesmith tulip
"Pours hazy golden. One finger white head. Light lacing. Aroma of citrus and pineapple. Taste follows the nose with dank, pine and Mellon. Great dipa."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
This is one of my favorites from BG.
"Growler purchased at Brew Gentlemen in Braddock, PA."
"A - Hazy, nearly opaque orange body, milky, with a moderate light, almost white head, and extensive lacing."
"Pours cloudy gold. All citrus on the nose, tropical fruit, tang. Taste is all juice with some citrus rind bitterness at the end. Texture is smooth and soft, very quenching. Great beer!"
"really tasty double from these guys, seemingly mostly if not entirely mosaic driven, i liked it a lot, but not as much as their base ipa, which is one of the best of these hazy east coast styles i have had in awhile. thicker than the ipa, denser, but still with a smooth uniform haze without any visible particulate in here. awesome aroma from the hops, juicy and more sweet than bitter by a mile. pineapple and lime, even mango to this, really fruity, a little better in the aroma and the flavor for me, the malt picks up midway in the flavor, and it starts to interfere a little bit. still the hops dominate, it just ends up a little unresolved i think, like it needs a higher IBU count or something, it lingers long, and while oily and hoppy, is also thick and sweet. there is a bit of booze sting here, not harsh at all, but really pretty evidently strong. less carbonation than the regular ipa too, but in a beer like this i dont really mind. impressive overall flavor profile, but this one seems less unique and perfected than their ipa, and represents more of the bandwagon type of hazy ipa, it didnt wow me the way the regular one did, but still, this is as good as any of the ones people are freaking out about..."
"Hazy colored north east style DIPA. Big juicy fruit flavors , such as grapefruit and pineapples, Low bitterness, tons of tropical aromas, absolutely delicious !"
Hazy lemon with white foam. Sweet fruity hoppy aroma. Complex sweet and bitter hop taste that is layered. Sophisticated DIPA and a pleasure to drink.
"L: yellow hazy with 1"" head. Good retention. "

"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a semi-clear, liquid gold color. Honey. Not turbid, but not clear. Truly speaking, this should be the definition of ""hazy"". Micro-particulate hangs in suspension, upon close examination. A very fat finger of completely foamy off-white head. Head hangs around for a while, and leaves sticky spots of lacing on the glass."
"Tasty and well-balanced. Not as hoppy as Congress Street and others, but really tasty except in direct comparison."
Hazy tangerine color with a thin head.
"Amber orange pour. Solid Portland Maine IPA. Very good for IPA. Has quite a bit of bitterness, and a strong finish with aftertaste of hops. Not as strong as Heady Topper."
8/11/18...pours bright brilliant gold with ring of white foam. Citrus nose. Malt forward flavor. Chewy mouthfeel. Surprisingly bready in the background. Gravitates towards being a pale ale. Tasty.
Semi-transparent straw color with a white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a hoppy with a citrus accent. Taste is also a hoppy with a citrus accent.
"Burnt gold pour, 1 finger of head, small specs of lacing throughout. Floral aroma,mango, light peach, resins. Fairly sweet, stronger mango/melon note, light astringency, pineapple, resin, sweet malt. Medium body, drying finish."
"Finally after 3 years got my hands on a 16 0z can that survived a friend's 2 wk vacation unchilled. Pours a beautiful gold, dark on top, light on bottom. Has a nice white foamy head that leaves bubbly lacing behind. The aroma is rich with flowers and tropical fruit. The taste follows with an earthy bitter follow through. The mouthfeel is creamy."
"Pours amber orange with an active head during pouring which fades to a small fluffy off-white head moderately quickly and clings nicely to the sides of the glass leading to significant lacing during drinking. Aroma is of grassy, citrus hops with a bit of dank thrown in. Taste follows with a big burst of grassy hops with citrus & touches of light sweetness of peach, floral, & caramel malt. Each sip ends with just a hint of biting bitterness. The taste overall reminds me somewhat of Heady; this is not a juicy fruity NEIPA, but it is an excellent IPA with great flavour & mouthfeel."

"Canned 7/4 so about 7 weeks old. Beautiful hazy beer as Trillium always does well. I love the soft feel as well. Almost creamy. Smell is a bit light but that’s probably due to the slight age on this one. Taste wise, it’s the first NEIPA that I wish were a little lighter. I can taste the booze and it’s a very full beer. Flavors are unique in a good way and the only thing that would help it would be if it were a little lower in abv I think."
A little too heavy dense of a beer for me.
"Wonderful white wine aroma right away on the nose, which give way to the Nelson and Galaxy hops. Classic New Englang mouthfeel. Hazy to the point of opaque."
This was better than I was expecting. I do think generally like IPAs with added juice but it completely complimented the hop profile and was super juicy but still balanced.

"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"From a 16oz can, dated 11/01/18. Served in a tulip."
"Pours a murky orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is pretty good, with a pillowy appearance. Aroma is pineapple, guava, papaya, tangerine, and orange with hints of toasty, earthy malts. Malts absolutely buried by hops. Flavor profile is pineapple, papaya, tangerine, guava, and orange. Malts are whispers, and hit notes of toasty, biscuity. Hops absolutely run the show here with a heavy tropical fruit presence that is just tweaked slightly from the standard tropical fruits. It's good, just a blast of flavor. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a fuzzy, graininess that borders on 'chalky'. Overall, big flavor matches the 10% ABV. Very good for those seeking a shotgun blast of flavor, but very little nuance or refinement here."
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma is sweet and fruity with dank hop notes. Taste is sweetish, citrusy and a bit astringent with a light bitterness on the finish. Really well balanced for a triple IPA."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip. Pours a golden orange hazy body with a big frothy white head that reduces to leave spotty lacing and a layer of retention. 
"16 oz can poured into a tulip. Pours a darker golden color. Not very bright in appearance. White head that dissipates and leaves sticky lacing to the glass. Aroma is insane. Citra all up in my face....citrus, mango, grapefruit....smells amazing. Taste follows the nose. Tons of citrus....mango and subtle grapefruit notes. The citra in this beer really pops. Feel is medium bodied and sticky/resinous. Really coating and leaves behind wonderful flavors of orange and grapefruit. Overall, this is a tremendous beer. Really love the showcase of Citra here. Noble did a great job with this one."

"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."

Can from Kevin
"this is an absolutely delicious ipa, and i owe a huge thanks to my brother for sending this one out from new york for me to enjoy! its fully on trend, but so much better than just about everything else out there in this style. its cloudy orange tinted when i pour it, and it holds several inches of thick white head like beaten eggs, stuff and peaky and lasting. no visible sediment but the cloudiness makes it appear quite thick and substantial. the aroma is killer, to me fresh tangerine, orange tic tacs, and even orange soda, canned mandarin oranges too, it would make sense if someone told me they added fruit to this, but i dont think thats the case. its all hops, i just have absolutely no idea which ones could have produced this striking aroma. its even more pronounced in the flavor, which might be the most impressive part of this beer overall. so often with the heavy dry hopped brews they are so aromatic but fade in the flavor, thats not the case at all here and in fact quite the opposite is true. its even more pungent in the taste, orange tic tacs and soda too, sweet for a minute, oily and rich, grounded only by the starchiness of the grain base, and barely at that. this thing is so unique, i cant even guess which hops might be responsible for such a distinctive and interesting flavor, but its awesome. seems like wheat or oats in the malt, maybe both, this is frothy and almost creamy feeling, which is great with all the orange character in this. dry and well carbonated, but i burp these one of a kind hops for awhile after the beer is gone. this was enormously impressive, my first beer from the acclaimed equilibrium. stoked to have gotten to try this one, its really special beer!"
"On tap. Quite different hop profile on the nose with some oniony notes, vegetal, dank, fruity but with some unique notes. Taste follows with fruity notes like melon but also chives and dill. Medium body and carbonation. Tasty and quite unique."
Look: Hazy murky yellow with small white head. Has low carbonation.
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
64oz growler thanks to airfoil. Served in HF tulip.
"Pours a crystal clear, deep golden color with a rapidly dissipating off-white head that gets perpetually fed by carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sweet grapefruit nose is so inviting. Full body that enters the mouth so smoothly you'd think it was nitrogen. Lovely citrus through and through without overpowering. This IPA has nice balance."
A- Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some nice spotty lacing.

Another big thank you out to Craig for this.
Can from the brewery for around $5. A well executed west coast tasting triple IPA

"Hop Stalker pours a perfect, and I mean perfect, clean and clear pale yellow to light orange color with a foamy white head. It coats the surface once it falls and could only be ranked a touch higher if it laced just a bit more."
"It’s nearly impossible to find a better wet hop beer where I am (about 25 miles away from the brewery). It’s unrivaled, by any wet hopped ale in distro in Ohio. Maybe even the entire US. "
"Amber with a thin head, the beer smells and tastes... fresh. Everything about the beer is fresh. The nose and taste go together: mild grassiness, a bit of sweet, with a background of bitter hop punch. It also packs a dank punch, to which I am partial. The end is raw and rough, with just that green bitterness on the palate."
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Canned on 9/26/18; consumed on 9/27/18. Another super-fresh one from Tree House tonight.
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

"Thanks to Bpfahl for this 16 oz. can, with art that’s an unsubtle head-butt to one of the great teen movies of all time. A fine-looking extra. "
"Pours a light/medium gold coloration with a medium, foamy head. Smell is very bright, hoppy and tropical, with notes of pineapple, passion fruit and guava, with a hint of booze. Taste follows the nose, being quite hoppy and tropical, with light citrus notes. Some light biscuity malt coming through as well. Strong notes of sweet, juicy pineapple and guava, with lighter notes of passion fruit and zesty grapefruit. There's a light dankness and just a hint of pine in the background as well. Finishes with a very light bitterness and very mild hop burn, with just a hint of booze coming through in the aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation. While there is a very mild booziness to this, it's still quite impressive how mellow and juicy this is at 10.5% ABV. I still don't really see the point of TIPAs, but have to say that this is exceptionally well-crafted. It also doesn't have these overripe, slightly artificial tasting fruit notes or bubblegum character that you get with many high-ABV IPAs."
Hazy golden orange. Frothy white head. Sticky lace.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

"From can into teku. Bright yellow-orange opaque appearance with good bit of foam head upon aggressive pour. Wonderful tropical aromaticity with ripe fruits: mango, peach. Juicy. Really nicely done with a medium, soft and creamy mouthfeel. Monkish makes exceptional NE style IPAs."
Very nice citrus aroma. Aroma almost makes it seem like it is going to have a sharp “bite” on the pallet. Taste is also citrusy and dank. Very clean. The “bite” isn’t there. Pillowy mouthfeel. Monkish is the real deal.

Juice like pour. Turbid bright straw yellow with a thick fluffy white head on medium pour. Nose is mellow and subdued. Tropical fruit notes with a touch of floral and earthy malt. Minimal on the latter tho. Taste of mangos and melon. Slight citrus and grass. A bit abrasive on the finish but I dig it. Smooth creamy body with a full thick mouthfeel. It’s good.
"Like Raul's prom night, this beer exceeds expectations! Super fruit tropical bomb, hazy like Trump’s brainwaves, and super lush like an LSD dream. Like Mount Pompeii erupting in hops, this one is beautiful."
"Exceptional beer offering by them. Hazy, someone muted smell/flavor, but extremely smooth and tasty. It's not the overwhelmingly dry/bitter/dank IPA you're used to on the West Coast, it's somewhere in the middle between east and west, but reminds you it's an east coast IPA. Great work."
"Poured from a growler filled a week ago, 03/17/18."
"16 oz. can. Hazy orange. Smells very tropical, tangerine, kinda sweet, and a bit of alcohol. Tastes of orange, mango, sweet malts, very low bitterness. Medium heavy. Good DIPA. I was pretty impressed at first, but it ended up being a little too sweet for me."

Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Hazy golden rose with two fingers of white ten minute head. Swirls of lace.
"A helpful bartender said ""I got just the beer for you."" When the glass arrived at the table its aroma caused my friend to ask what on earth I was drinking!"
"On tap at Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT after a bruising 9-hour drive from southern PA. (I just offer that for context: sometimes things taste better after a long day; also, provenance [Waterbury, IMHO, being being the galactic epicenter of craft brewing] might make a difference). A nice clear amber with a fine-bubbled persistent off-white head. Initial impression was OMG: smooth, creamy fruitiness, with lots amd lots of citrus, a healthy dose of pine, some earthiness to keep it real, and a dose of caramel and biscuit malts to balance everything out. Mouthfeel is fluffy and smoooooth; carbonation is perfect. Finish is dry and a little bitter, but sweet too."
"Growler fill from Last Drop. Served in my LHBCo tulip. Coppery in color, and translucent, without much head formation. Really nice tropical fruit aroma: pineapple, guava. Flavor has an initial bite, but is very flavorful still. Delicious simcoe dominates. I get sweet orange peel complemented by a biscuity malt presence which provides more balance than I expected from a proud, aggressively named, PNW IPA. My second ale from Boneyard does not disappoint, though living up to Armored Fist is hard to imagine."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "

On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
On tap 6/6 at Cellarmaker. Belgian tulip
"Excellent hazy ipa. name says it all. Super tropical, fruity hop notes. low bitterness but full of flavor. Cellar maker keeps killing it. Best of the series for sure."
"Had this at one of those Bistro double ipa festivals in recent times. I'm sure I could look it up, but suffice to say it was in the last 1-2 years. Cloudy yellow pour on this one. Small thin white head that eviscerates from its smallish 1/6"" head to zilch in the quickness. Huge blast of pineapple like hops. I think its all Citra but damn also smacks of Galaxy. "
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, red session. Aroma is really dank with citrus fruits, mostly tangerine. Taste is juicy, really fruity and citrusy. Some grapefruit bitterness on the finish."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

The smell is big pineapple with a pine dankness and some subtle tropical fruit. The taste is impressive. Big and bold pineapple flavor with a hint of citrus fruits, such as grapefruit, melon, tangerine and mango with just a hint of pine hoppiness."
"This is an incredible NEDIPA with the signature three hops that got the style on the map. Soft, juicy, with a nice dry bitter finish. Execution on point!"
"Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is orange, tangerine, and grapefruit rind. Medium bodied, slightly bitter, and low carbonation. Excellent juice bomb that is different from other NEIPAs. Awesome. Glad I got a four pack."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

Picked-up six cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton for four dollars and five cents. My twentieth brew reviewed from these guys. Very solid brew.
Poured into Belgian tulip.
"For me, this beer varies quite a bit batch to batch. It can be one of Tree House's best or kind of average. If you hit them on a good day, buy the limit. Buy the limit anyway since you don't know and the ""bad"" days are worth the risk."
"Hazy light golden color with white head. Aroma has ripe citrus fruits, mango and hop resin on a clean malt background. Taste starts bittersweet and hoppy with citrus rind and resiny hop flavors. Aftertaste lingers with a good amount of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. A more west coast approach of the style but it's well made and tasty."
a: muted orange color with some amber & dark yellow notes. slightly hazy. 2 finger frothy white head
"From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Plenty of nice orangey notes in a good, smooth body. Didnt have a strong citra profile, but is really nice and original with its orangyness"
"Wow, another Treehouse beer that's almost exactly like the rest."
Somehow locked this one down in Chico from a local who gets beer mail. He left it on my porch at 5am on his way to the airport early today and it was still frosty from the morning chill when I got to it. Cracked it same day after discgolfin and a hot shower and holy HOONTAH is this delish. A crisp hit of bitterness turns into the exact feeling of drinking an orange julius. First Treehouse offering i've tried. If I ever conjure enough $ to go on an east coast beercation I will be definitely stopping in Mass. to try other offerings from the source! Short story long: DIDNT DISAPPOINT!!
Pour is orange gold. Definite taste of Orange and citrus. Very drinkable and in my opinion one of the best treehouse offerings. Solid easy coast IPA.

Review from notes dated 4/9/18 and from currently drinking on 4/20/18
"Poured out as a hazy yellow color with a great looking white head on top. The smell has a very nice hop aroma coming off of it. The taste of the beer is very well balanced with a nice malt profile and hop bitterness. The feel is nice and smooth, very drinkable. Overall it's a very nice beer!"
"Wow, it's been about 9 months since I first had this beer's little brother, Four Seam... seems like yesterday that IH's first NEIPA graced my palate. Honestly, Four Seam is an awesome little beer, but Six Seam is in another league (baseball jokes notwithstanding!)... read on to find out how much this beer has impressed me!"
Just perfect

"16 oz can. Light cloudy golden pour. Aroma pops of pineapple, wow! Tropical flavors, on the sweet side, almost too sweet. Nice dry citrus peel finish. Really solid brew by Monkish, as expected."
"Smell: Straight pineapple candy, pineapple juice. Mango, papaya, orange juice. straight Tropical fruit juice. No malt presence at all."
Wow.

"On tap at Prison City Pub and Brewery in Auburn, NY."
"Revisiting this beer based on tasting notes, and I can't say that Paste Magazine's recent blind test (https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/247-of-the-best-american-ipas-blind-tasted-and-ran.html?p=4) does it any sort of disservice. Hazy orange, with a borderline pink hue. This is basically the beer version of Sunny-D. Big papaya, citrus, and pineapple aromas on the nose, followed by a massive punch of the same flavors on the body. Medium-bodied and satisfyingly drinkable. This is honestly the best beer that Upstate NY makes, and I'm proud to say that it's local. I hope that the folks at Prison City bring this one out year-round."
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
DDH Citra + Galaxy - Other Half
L - you know how I know there's Galaxy hops in here? This shit pours a milky banana yellow. It doesn't even look like beer! Looks like frozen pineapple juice. 
"Pours cloudy gold color that looks like pineapple juice with the typical 1-2 finger foamy off white head that leaves good spotty lacing. Smells and tastes like pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, lime, tangerine and orange peel, followed by floral notes, coriander, peppery spices and piney notes. The malt backbone is sturdy with graham cracker, toasted grains, biscuit and light caramel. Another really tasty OH beer which doesn't seem dry hopped since it was very juicy and flavorful."
Outstanding indeed.
"Picked this up when it was released at the brewery, as the date on the bottom of the can was 10/18 with ""TIME TO FIST BUMP"" under it. I enjoyed the regular version of this but of course, this double dry-hopped take was smoother, juicier, and just that much more enjoyable! I'm not sure if these are the two best hops out there, but it's easy to see why they're so easy to quaff after forcing myself to take my time savoring this!"
"Growler from Alpine. Orange color, good head, yes. Aroma of hops and hops and then hops? Pine, citrus, etc. flavor was damn hoppy with only the slightest hint of what I'm guessing are summit hops (onion). Great IPA, super hoppy, glad I got to try it."
"Drove down to Alpine on a heavenly sunny day, but Raul was greeted with extremely dearth results: Nelson is tapped and all IPA bottles are sold out. Wowieee! But Raul is not one to fret, so he jumped his ass on a limited O'Briens IPA."
64oz growler thanks to airfoil. Served in HF tulip.
"Pours a crystal clear, deep golden color with a rapidly dissipating off-white head that gets perpetually fed by carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sweet grapefruit nose is so inviting. Full body that enters the mouth so smoothly you'd think it was nitrogen. Lovely citrus through and through without overpowering. This IPA has nice balance."
A- Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice white head. Head has pretty solid retention and leaves some nice spotty lacing.

"Another wonderful hazy dipa from Toppling Goliath. The pour is beautiful with white foam crowning a yellow hazy concoction. The smell is full of hops, with typical hazy fruit filtering up, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, melon, along with hay and wild flowers. The taste has some added honey, earthy tones, and some banana. The feel is light and fluffy. Enjoyed quite a bit, but like other ipas from TG more"
"Cloudy golden straw pour . Smell is tropical fruit, orange, and pineapple. Taste follows the nose and stays sweet with hints of tropical papaya fruit . Creamy medium body. Bitter aftertaste with sine warming."
"Juicy, earthy, and bitter."

I don’t love this beer as much as everyone else. 
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."

Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
"Definitely the best beer I tried at Heist, It poured hazy like most of their IPA's with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer had a very nice hop aroma coming off of it. The taste has a solid bitterness coming off of it which was nice, The sweetness of the malt is still there but the hops kind of punch right through it. The feel is smooth. Overall This is the one to try if you're at Heist, they're all solid but this one is the one I feel hits the hardest."

I got this beer as an extra from a friend in NC. To say that I was surprised is an understatement. This beer is great. Looks like a beer from Veil or Trillium pouring a hazy orange/yellow color. Big tropical nose with a lot of grapefruit scent. The taste is phenomenal. Basically a juice bomb with slight bitterness on the finish that makes you want another sip immediately. The mouthfeel is a lot lighter than what you would expect for 8.4% ABV. I would have never known about this beer if it weren't thrown in as an extra and i am glad that it was.
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"
"Super murky orange in color. I’m not much on imperials but this one is about as fruity and orange flavored as it gets. Soft mouthfeel and taste is superb, I’m a huge fan of citraquenchl so this one was a winner for me. Heist killing it as always"
"32oz crowler sent to me by Dragginballs76 as part of a dastardly sneak attack on my porch. According to the writing on the side of the crowler, it was canned on May 10 (presumably of this year!) and is 8.1% alcohol."
Pours a hazy dark orange apricot color with two fingers of dense white head.
A: Pours a super murky pale bright golden yellow in color (think beeswax) with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising quickly along the edges of the glass and faint lemon yellow colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense sudsy foamy bright white head that slowly reduces to a couple of small patches of thin film surrounded by a large patch of very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
"Pours hazy orange. Foamy, medium white head that fades slowly with lacing."

I Never Sleep looks like melted butter. The completely opaque yellowish liquid is capped by a relatively thin and unstable foamy off white head that retreats to leave just a ring around the edge of the glass.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Taste is mostly hoppy but not as intense as other Monkish IPAs. Taste follows hoppy, bitter, herbal on the finish."
"Canned on 04/25/18, ‘DEADHEAD’."
Appearance: Arrives cloudy and honey colored with a pillowy white head; a few strands of lacing lacing around the glass.
"Poured from a tallboy into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy, opaque, orange-peach coloring, looking like a glass of juice, with a halo of clingy white head. Aromas of orange juice, peach puree, spicy pine needles, dried grass, and some earthy highlights. Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on orange and grapefruit, but with some solid peach and pineapple notes in there, too. Pepper spiced and herbal hops characteristics level it out, with dried grass and pine needle notes, too. Very dynamic and very well balanced on a mid-body with a solid dry, acidic edge. The aftertaste is all juice, sweet and acidic, lingering on past the slick, juicy, and somehow slightly dry finish. Really tasty, juicy beer."
"Canned 7/2/16 (I think?). Consumed 7/20/16 in Brooklyn (notably, after the can made the 2500-mile journey in 90+ degree heat)."
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.
What to say...other than WOW!! Thanks Singlecut for getting me all hopped up and have me to adjust my monthly beer budget. Hahahaha
"Simply, the best IPA I ever had. But, be prepared for an incredible hoppy beer."
"Shared a pint can, stamped 09/06/18 on the handsome label, with an IPA snob buddy. Poured gently into Spiegelau IPA glasses. Excellent head with superior retention and lacing. Color SRM 9, fairly turbid but not opaque. Smells just shy of perfect: gloriously hopped. Taste a fine hop bomb cloaking the 8.6% ABV magically. Such a tasty brew, I feel almost sacrilegious trying to analyze it. My beer snob buddy agrees Singlecut beersmiths know what to do with IPA. Magic spells indeed!"
"Turbid, slushy orange, little head. Aroma is a little whispy - a little vague citra / tropical note, slight earthiness but nothing really asserts itself. Taste is in the same vein - melon rind, soft pine bitterness, but none of the flavors really coalesce. Washed-out. Singlecut makes some great beers and this one has a great rep but I was left a little unthrilled"
"16oz can. Hazy, orange in color, very much a juice-like appearance. There's a lot going on aroma-wise. Melon notes hit the nose first. Some grass and pine are mixed in. Undercurrents of some of the more exotic tropical fruits: passion fruit, papaya. A very effusive and pleasant aroma overall."

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

"On tap, pours a mostly hazy yellow-gold. Smell has tons of tangerine, stone fruit, tropical fruit and some pine. Taste follows, very come and delicious. Feel is a little light for a double IPA, making it very drinkable. Top-notch beer."
Thanks to JBowenGeorgia for the chance to try this one.

"This beer is another triumph by NEBCO. Just picked up a few fresh four-packs from the brewery. Rich golden-orange color with a thick, durable head. Aromas of orange zest, keffir lime leaf, fresh melon, and resinous pine. Dry yet generous and extremely long on the palate (honestly, count in seconds how long the finish goes). Similar to G-Bot in that they are both basically perfect DIPAs, but with noticeably different flavor profiles due to the different hop bills. I am officially a NEBCO fanboy."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."

"A 12 fl. oz. can, canned on 2nd October 2018, and with a drink by date of 13th November 2018. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass."
Have had the rest of the six-pack and cannot be happier with the quality of the Hill beers in cans.
"Pours a murky bright orange color. Awesome nose, tons of citrus and tropical fruits, taste is a little bit bitter. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation."
12 oz can poured into pint glass canned on 10/2.
"Tastes of Oats. American imperial IPA with honey as well and multiple hop strains including Simcoe, galaxy, and Nelson Sauvin. Solid, but not my favorite."

First beer from Sand City!
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a one inch head that left spotty lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of tropical and citrus fruits, pine and a hint of sweet malt. Tastes of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pine and a subtle malt presence. Minimal bitterness on the finish. Light to medium bodied, well carbonated, smooth and incredibly easy to drink. Another winner from Sand City."
"Double dry-hopped with Citra, Simcoe, Chinook, and Mosaic... No canning date... Medium gold body, hazy, white head a couple of fingers high on a moderate pour into a pint; left some lace lines down the glass... Aromas of citrus and tropical fruits muddled with mild earthy dank tones... Muted citrus of grapefruit and mildly sweet fruit melded with herbal pine and a little muskiness... Bitterness is subtle, with just a faint sweetness alongside, soft and airy-feeling, medium-light weight... Super smooth drinking... Batch released 3/10/17..."

One of my favorites from BG!
750ML swingtop growler poured into a Brew Gentlemen tulip glass:
"750 ml growler. Pours super cloudy light orange with thin white head, rings of lace left behind. Juicy pineapple and mango aroma. Great tasting, balanced IPA, juicy citrus, mango sweetness, with a bunch of dank weedy hops. Nice back end bitterness lasts just right. Medium to full creamy soft feel. My first brew from these guys, impressive."

"Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap."
"Not a NE style (thank God!). Just a beautiful Westcoaster bought at Sam’s in Durham, NC in a canned sixer for a fair price. Should have bought more because I only get there a couple times a year. Clear (no gassy yeast!), hoppy, a tad of sweet malt; this is one of their best. Don’t be scared of the monster on the can, just trust the masters at Stone and your Holloween will be perfect!"
Enjoy by 10.31.18 - 
10.31.18 was a very good offering.
"I really enjoyed ""Enjoy by 10.31.18"" from Stone, ABV 9.40%, IBU 90. I liked it better than the unfiltered Enjoy By, which had a garlic undertone (this one doesn't)."
The 10.31.2018 is awesome
"This beer's color absolutely radiates gold with a big foamy head, an absolutely gorgeous pour. Aroma is upbeat and citrusy, but nothing truly of note. Taste is smooth, dank but sweet with the expected hops bite. The big ABV and malt keep it mostly sweet at the back end of a swallow. Mouthfeel, again, is incredibly smooth. Delicious, but maybe a little too rich for more than one or two a sitting."
"This is one of the top IPAs I've had (and I'm not an IPA guy). Really had solid hops and offered great color and mouthfeel. Super value compared to Treehouse, Heady Topper and other rarities."

I drank this when it was super fresh (>1.5 weeks if I recall correctly) and the flavors were in your face! I would of loved to let another one sit for a month to taste the difference because I could see this beer really coming together with more time.
"L - yup, that's haze alright. Peachy orange glow. Minimal head with just a ring when all is said and done. "
"Medium-pale gold beer, hazed to opacity, under a couple of fingers of white head that trailed arms of lace down the glass... Typically citric and tropical fruit impressions abound in this New England-style IIPA from Other Half, providing zing and tingle in a soft, smooth, amply carbonated malt body... Featuring Motueka, Mosaic, and Chinook hops, this is yet another quality entry in the flooded NEIPA style from one of the masters at brewing them... 2/15/18 canning..."
"This beer pours a completely opaque golden yellow color with a slight orange hue and a two finger, pillowy, creamy, bright white head. Retention is excellent and there are many filmy rings and chunks of lacing left on the glass."
"Acquired from brewery on release day, poured vigorously into a teku for maximum foam. Nice 2 finger head that lingers and laces. Dark orange and brown haze, nicely blended. Sweet candy, cotton candy, bubble gum, spices on the nose. All carry over to taste, but a couple unpleasant notes on tastebuds. Smooth drink that mellows and balances nicely, more harsh than anything. This is an interesting brew that opens up nicely. It comes off way too harsh at first, but balances into a nice refreshing and complex brew."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

Trying to get caught up on ratings. This one is a close second as my favorite CT variant. Citra edges this by a little but the El Dorado in this is like candy!
"This is absolutely incredible. Love the slight honey notes that complement perfectly the pineapple/orange combo from the hops. Tropical flavor all over, pours creamier than most Trilliums."
"Really hazy peach color with off-white head. Aroma has sweet malt, some honey, overripe orange and a hint of peppermint. Taste is sweet and fruity at first but gets really dry, slightly astringent. Aftertaste is long and quite sweet with dried orange peel flavor. Medium body and carbonation, quite dry. Overall it's quite interesting with a different hop profile."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."

Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."

Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
"Aroma pineapple big time. Nice lacing as always with sand city. Pours golden. Taste big pineapple, orange, mango and banana. Super crushable. Great collaboration."
"Sand City/Finback collab, 8% abv DIPA, ""refermented on heaps of pineapple,"" double dry hopped with Mosaic and Azacca hops... 11/25 release... Opaque pineapple-orange juice-looking beer with a finger or two of head on top and some thin lacing left behind... Bursting with tropical juiciness, pineapple at the fore, underscored with elements suggesting orange and mango... Smooth and soft, tingly with tanginess - another entry into that beer fruit juice smoothie category... Excellent stuff..."
Tall can
"From the can, pours cloudy yellow color with a 1-2 finger foamy off white head that faded slowly and left very good spotty lacing, with a lot of sediment floating in it. It really looked like pineapple juice."
"If you like pineapple, seek out this beer. Outstanding fruit expression that transitions into a wonderful, archetypal Sand City DIPA base reminiscent of the ONE series as it warms. Adjunct addition really adds to the base here rather than detracting or working orthogonally."
"Unber juicy, soft and fruity! Incredible dipa!!"
Worth the wait!
"I have been called a homer before and often wear that tag with pride as some of the best suds in the country are coming from New York, but there is the rare occasion that homerism aside...we've stumbled upon something special and homerism shouldn't be considered a factor...and this is just that beer. Sure this is from finback and sand city...two of the areas finest ipa makers, but this beer....THIS beer!!!"
"Can, Oct 2018"
Crisp and fruity very good beer. Taste of nectarine Malin and citrus very soft mouth feel. Well balanced and solid color and drinkability. 8.4% ABV well taken.
"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty dollars. One of my favorite brews from these guys, although very expensive."
"L: Hazy, like half-pulp Tropicana and amber "

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
Very smooth for a triple
"If you're looking for just one can for the evening, this would be a great place to land. AGE packs everything you need from a NEIPA into one sleek can. A tide of bright, juicy hops waves carries you through the warmth of a 10%+ hammer."
A solid beer! Just a bit too boozy for me! I do love beers that are 10-11% but this one hits a little too hard for me. All the hops are killer though!
Pure golden in color. Head is white almost bright white. The nose is like a glass of orange juice. The taste is juicy and delicious. Follow through was a soft finish of citrus bitterness. This is a great New England IPA

No head from the bar pour. No lace. Mild haze. The color is dirty gold. 
"650ml bottle, snifter glass. Pours a darker copper body, clear, with a one finger white head, good retention, bits of lacing. Smell is grapefruit juice, citrus, a bit of grapefruit zest, light grain, a bit of orange peel also. Flavour follows, a bit sweeter than the nose would suggest, but a nice sweet tangerine fruitiness, grapefruit and lemon zest, orange peel, mild grainy and toffee sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium body, lighter carbonation which is still appropriately within limits of the style, mild zesty orange juice finish."
Appearance - The beer poured a orange copper color with a white head. 
Exceptional double from Pipe Works
"Bomber bottle, I could find no bottling/freshness dating "
"Living in central Illinois, we don't have a lot of great local breweries distributing here. Pipeworks just recently started so I had to celebrate with a new bomber I haven't had."
Another awesome beer in the fish series. Pdubs is on point with their dipas.
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

"Friend got this for me at the brewery. the beer pours with a bright, murky yellow appearance with a thin head. Pretty rich smell of hops, citrus from an orange smell, and some cream. Good mix of a cream based orange citrus flavor. Creamy texture for the mouthfeel. Overall, great taste and mouthfeel and a spectacular appearance."
"Traded for this beer as it was released when I was gone in November, finally getting a chance to have it tonight. Love the label but the beer inside was just as enjoyable and colorful. Smooth, lush, and just dank enough, this had so much going for it and was tough to keep in the glass for the duration of my review!"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy.

"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Doesn't get much better than this... One of the biggest yet still balanced beers I've had.
Another solid offering from Trillium.
CANNED ON 06/19/18.
"Tasted this alongside MBC Lunch, Four Quarters Ghost in the Sky and Gun Hill Vox Populi. The others didn't fair well in comparison. And I love all of them. Part of that was the shear ""this one goes to 11"" of Trillium's study in utter lack of restraint. Intense tropical and resin aromas backed by juicy, massive flavor. You simply cannot not stop drinking. Pacing yourself is not an option. A beer I would likely abandon my wife and children for. A small complaint though--this beer is not easy on the eyes. Sludgy gray-ish peach color, like the complexion of some consumptive poet. From now on I'll just drink it from the can."
Draft at Trillium - Canton location.
"This one pours a super cloudy bright yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Really starting to believe that Trillium is the best beer in New England (south of Greensboro, Vermont) and this beer is a great example of why. Hardly ever brewed but world class none the less."

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."

Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
"Cloudy orange with thin white head that leaves sheets of lacing. Creamy orange and slight peach in the nose. Continues to the taste, coupled with moderate bitterness and a nice herbal character. Medium bodied with a classic soft feel. Very nice."
"Smell: Really citrus forward. Juicy orange, like orange juice, lemon, lime, tangerine. It has a lot zestiness. Lime and lemon zest. There’s a really mellow tropical fruit presence, predominantly mango. Underneath that there is a really light yeasty bubblegum quality. There isn’t really any malt presence to speak off."
"Pretty opaque but quite hazey, light yellow-gold. Aroma has softer tropical notes - some melon rind and stone fruit - with some alpha hops. Probably the most hop-forward of the BG beers I have had, it teeters on being a little too bitter especially on the back palate but it is still quite good. I definitely got a lot of melon / cantaloupe vibes and in general more earthy fruit than big bursts of tropical flavors, the mosaic brings some grassyness to it as well."
"Big aromas of citrus, pineapple, tropical, finishes nice and dry. Creamy, full mouth feel. Another incredible beer made by Brew Gentlemen. All of these IPAs and Double IPAs look unbelievable. They are glowing yellow orange like a big fresh glass pineapple/ orange juice. No hop bitterness whatsoever."
Pillowy soft mouthfeel. Bold citrus flavors with enough sweetness and only slight bitterness. Juicy and well rounded. Easy to drink for a DIPA. Tangerine and grapefruit.

22 oz bomber fresh
I've been to the brewery and it's good there but I've also experienced barrel-aged at beer festivals -- and that is to die for. Stuff is so rich it leaves a slick on the glass. Amazing all-around
Picked up a bomber at Binny's in downtown Chicago on 5-11-18 for $11.99. Bottled on 4-13-18. Stored in the beer fridge upon our return to PHX.

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."

Appearance - Pours clear deep golden color with huge fluffy white head. Lots of spotty lacing around the glass.
"Pours a hazy dark copper color with bright tangerine edges and a two finger pillowy off-white head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting cap. Excellent retention taking a while to settle and coating the glass wih large chunks of soapy lacing on its way down. A little darker than expected but retention and lacing are impressive. "
"Thanks to HIGHPA for this 22 oz. bottle, which comes after some post Huna Day detox. I probably shouldn’t drink until May. Split with my wife. "
Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a white head that left thick lacing.
"Dark rust / gold murky appearance, with a nice foamy lasting head. Pine and caramel on the nose and palate. Nice full mouthfeel for and IPA. East coast and west coast come together nicely on this one."

"Pours an orangish yellow, slight white foamy head. When held up to the light, it looks like a glass of milky orange juice. Great citrus aroma. Flavor is sweet and milky, loads of citrus and tropical fruit: orange, lemon, pineapple, mango. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall a fun beer, I am getting a little tired of the “lactose” ipa’s, but this one has a nice balance of sweetness and hoppy bitterness."
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
DDH Space Daydream - Other Half
Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/18/2018 (code: MIDWEEKH05) and purchased at the brewery that weekend.
"32oz growler from Other Half. Pours an opaque milky yellow with an inch of frothy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is lots of sweet fruits. Pineapple, orange, lime, mango and some fruity candy as well. The taste has more citrus than I got from the nose. Grapefruit, lemon and lime along with the pineapple. Some herbal and dank hop notes. Fleshy fruit finish with a bit citrus acidity. Creamy with a dry mouthfeel. Moderate alcohol presence."

"Traded for this at Other Half as it costs a ton of money in tolls to drive out to Sand City from here. I love both of these breweries and like the other reviewers on here, this one didn't disappoint. Green, strong, and sticky, there was a lot going on here but in the end, this went down well for having more than enough heft to it!"
"Double dry hopped, featuring Galaxy, Mosaic, and Motueka hops; 12/23/17 can release..."
"Can from yesterday's release and it did not disappoint. Like all Sand City beers, it's a bit green at this point so I will do a full review in 1-2 weeks. The bones of this brew are outstanding so this will definitely get better."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

"16oz can courtesy of beerloserLI. Contract brewed and canned in Sterling, Virginia, on February 23, 2018 per the label and bottom stamp. I do know a ""tesseract"" is a thing but not what kind of thing."
"this one checks all the categories and probably ends my need to trade away my cellar for NE IPA from out east. bright orange and super haze, nose is awesome but the taste and feel is just super creamy perfection."
I can say this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's pretty much perfect. Pours a nice head. Bright and hazy. Pillowy mouth feel. And incredibly well balance from start to finish. They really hit it out of the park.

22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
Canned a month ago. 
"Solid flavor, unique taste, smooth finish"
Hazy golden-bronze with three fingers of yellowed head. Soapy rings of lacing.
Another can picked up Friday at the (now-closed!) Congress Street outpost of Trillium. Pretty proud of hitting 50 lbs. right on with my luggage; not a wasted ounce. 16 oz. can dated 9/24/18.
The smell of this beer is one of the best out there! Aromas and taste of tropical fruit come through and make you want more. Great feel and refreshing finish.
"For me, this one tastes better out of the can, as it retains the wine aromas better. Not enough hops for me. The alcohol was hidden for me as well, which could be dangerous given the ABV. Enjoyable for sure, but not their best IMHO."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores

"All Citra DIPA that is an overwhelmingly awesome sensory experience. Radiant orange color with plenty of head. Completely overflowing with tropical and citrusy hop flavor. Nicely carbonated, exceptionally well balanced, and very clean and dry on the finish. As good as their other top DIPAs. [5/3/18 can into Becher glass]"
"love this beer. it is an exceptional beer that gets me excited to drink it every time! New England Brewing Co. is still cranking out delicious beer, but they are sadly being overshadowed some by newer breweries! that's fine! more beer for me! hahah but really keep up the good work NEBCO! love me some double fuzzy!"

Opaque pale corn milk yellow-tan with a massive off-white airy foam that settles in fits and starts.
"This one pours a very hazy and creamy looking light yellow color, with a small head, and tons of lacing."
"Tangerine, perfect balanced bitterness, very light sweet malt, guava, light mango, pineapple, yeast, bubblegumvery well hidden drinks more like a 6%-7% IPA"
"On tap at Cugino’s. Pours a hazy golden color with a good head and some lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, bit of pine and malt sweetness. Taste of orange, bit of citrus and nice touch of malt. Nice bitterness with a bit of orange in the finish. Medium body, very flavorful and nicely crafted. Enjoyable beer."
Canned 4/26/18; drank 5/1/18 @ the Yarchives. 
"I received this in @swenny916's BIF box. Poured from 16 oz. can into Narrow Gauge pint glass. It pours a cloudy, muddy-tangerine color with almost a finger of fluffy, bright white head, and lots of soapy lacing. It has as fruity a nose as I've encountered: orange, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, ripe honeydew melon, vanilla, and subdued but fragrant hops. From the time I popped the can you can smell it. The taste is fantastic! It opens with vanilla/lactose and sweet orange, tart lemon and grapefruit, and a flavorful blend of Citra, Galaxy, and Amarillo hops that begins fruity but quickly turns bitter and finishes with a peppery bite. There's a touch of astringent burn at the finish (in a good way!) This ale is rich and creamy with lively carbonation, and the 8.6% ABV gives it a really nice kick. This is a fun beer to drink! Overall, this is absolutely first rate and given its rarity on the East Coast I'm grateful to have tried it."
"Cloudy appearance, but get ready for full on flavor. Not too bitter, tangy with plenty of citrus tones. Slight amount of sweetness, with a really nice mouth feel. Buy!"
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

Growler picked up at the brewery yesterday. 
On-tap at New England Brewing Co.
"Excellent DIPA. Maybe overhyped, but very good nonetheless. Hoppy, little juice, no boozy taste for 8.8%. Highly recommend."
BOOM!
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Half a finger head with decent lacing. Piney hoppy aroma. Hoppy taste with pineapple notes. Good local beer."
"Finally got my hands on the elusive G-Bot! I've wanted to try this since the beginning of my BA days and even though they're the next state over, I never made the trip down to the New Haven area. Got a growler at the brewery for Christmas leave, along with many others from NEBCo. I let this sucker get to a proper room temperature."
"Truly wonderful, basically perfect DIPA. Radiant orange-gold color. Intense flavors of fresh strawberry, peach, and spearmint. Medium-bodied and quite resinous with a finish that just does not stop. This beer easily separates itself from the hoards of DIPAs being brewed right now. [on tap at the brewery]"
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.

A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."

"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
"pours out a murky pale yellow-orange color with a pretty dense white head, nice lacing left behind. supppper aromatic, on nose i get peaches, mango, honey, powdered sugar, danky danks, grapefruit, orange, passionfruit lemon, doughy and sweet malts. this is largely followed on palate, huge blast of tropical and herbaceous character, ripe mango, creamy peaches, orange, hint of that bubblegum note, plastic dankness, slightly spicy earthy hops, peppery vegetal thing, some doughy and sweet almost caramel malts, finishes with a mild piney bite. super ripe and fruity, but not one note in the way that some other juicy IPAs are. there is a bit of balance with the green and herbaceous danky quality, blending beautifully with bready malts and fruit smoothie. mouthfeel is medium bodied and has some very fluffy texture to it. HOT DAYUM THIS BEER IS LEGIT AF!!!"
"Pours a super hazy medium pale orange color with a huge frothy head that leaves lacing for days. ARoma is floral and bitter, mild tropical notes - seems like Citra. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with minor bite at the end, nice floral taste. Up and coming brewery!"
"WOW,WOW,WOW!"
"I had this at the brewery on release day so couldn't be fresher. It pours a cloudy orange-copper color with an extensive milk-white head and extensive lacing. It's a really elegant pour. The nose features a plethora of fruit: lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, and ripe melon, along with pine needles and floral hops. The taste is exquisite: the fruit is abundant but there is also a vanilla/caramel sweetness just before the burst of hops at the finish. Everything blends beautifully. This is a nicely carbonated ale and the 8.5% ABV is just right. It's easy to drink but not overwhelming. Overall, this is a delightful and delicious DIPA. I'm really imprssed."
Poured from a growler filled at the brewery into a teku.
S: Mango. Pineapple. Papaya. Bright juicy oranges. Slight stonefruit. Grapefruit pith. Dank nugs. Resin.
This triple dry hopped DIPA delivers one of the best beer experiences I've ever had. Drank it slowly to enjoy the hop partials falling to the bottom of my glass. Monkish strives for perfection with their IPAs. This is proof.
On tap at Omnipollos Hatt in Stockholm.
"Beautiful peach sorbet (albeit a little murky) with small white head. Awesome aroma of mango, pineapple, guava, and citrus. Flavor follows with the addition of a bit of green hop character, grapefruit pith, dank, and a nice bitterness. Great beer."
"A: Pours out murky, turbid, hazy--bright orange driving on lemonade yellow with just the faintest hint of a head. A few tiny bubbles persist to form a ring around the edge of the glass, but whatever semblance of a head formed on the moderately gentle pour dissipates in a matter of moments."
Canned 6/13/17; drank 6/19/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"On tap at Willibrew. Pours a hazy brownish orange with very little head. The nose is a blend of fruits with some dank hops. Passionfruit, guava and some mint. The taste is a good amount of berries along with dank hops and some resin. Resinous finish with a chewy mouthfeel. Medium body with a moderate alcohol presence."
"Incredible beer. Up there with the very best few brews that you can find ANYWHERE in New England. Smells like passion fruit and grapefruit. Incredibly well balanced. There is nothing at all ""off"" in this beer - not too much or too little of anything. It manages to straddle a line between NE Juice Bomb IPA and more (new) traditional piney brews from the likes of NEBCO - not surprising given the head brewer. This is one of the very few beers that I prefer over Tree House beers. I always drink it from a tall pilsner glass because I seem to get more captured in the smell that way. You can read about the color and opacity and head in all the other reviews here. But the bottom line is that this is a masterpiece."
"I really liked this one on tap, reminded me of Locust Reign from NEBCO. Not a juicy or tropical IPA but more dank, resinous, floral, balanced, tons of pith and lupulin. Very interesting beer and I'm glad I got to try it."
tremendous beer. I have had the fortune of tasting all of Counterweights brews and this one surpasses them all to include Space Coyote. This is a delicious beer with a nice amount of alcohol but still very drinkable. The tropics are felt in both the smell and taste. Very well done.
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale gold with a medium head that leaves a creamy lace over most of the glass. Nose is not massive, but very pleasant with peach and some citrus. Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"This pours a tan gold. There’s a sticky sweet aroma with tangerine and citrus notes. The beer itself comes off as surprisingly light and approachable, given its strength. I get lots of citrus and some resin. It’s strong but hides it and plays well with others."
"Draft @ Ale Arsenal on 1/9/15. Pours a yellow to amber color with 1 finger of head. Slight lacing. Aroma of pine, resin, citrus, and tropical fruits. Taste is quite dank with plenty of resinous goodness, but also nice balance with notes of citrus and tropical fruits with some malty character and alcohol present. Well balanced and not too boozy for a triple IPA. Solid and very drinkable."

Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazy vibrant orange color with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. Lots of Mosaic in the nose with some light floral and grassy hop notes. The taste is a mix of berries, grapefruit and some dank hops. Slightly floral towards the end with doughy malts and more berries. Maybe a hint of pineapple. Dank finish. Heavy mouthfeel with a dry mouthfeel. Moderate alcohol burn. Supernaut is a great beer and this one only improves it."
a; slight haze; deep gold in color; 1+ finger off white head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;
"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Nice light lacing with about one finger of head. Very stong pine and grapefruit aroma with some lemon notes. Taste is the same with some stonefruit. Overall great dipa."
Fantastic! I am a mosaic fan and love Supernaut. This beer is exceptional in every way. Easy to drink with a great nose and super taste. NEBCO always does a great job and this is no exception.

Shimmering Jurassic Park amber with an airy white foam settling to a creamy white ring.
"Had a couple of pints of this at the local pub. Yellowish orange in color with very good clarity. Poured with a thin, bright white, soapy foam with low medium retention. Medium high citrus and orange hop aromas with reinous and fresh floral notes. Medium light malt aroma. Medium bodied and smooth with pleasant warmth from the middle to the end. Medium high citrus and floral hop flavors with earthy, resinous notes up front followed by assertive hop bitterness through the middle. Malt and caramel malt flavors manage to peek through on the back end. Finished with pleasant warmth and pine hop bitterness that didn't linger. Despite the assertive bitterness this was very drinkable. Still a bit of a sipper but it didn't annihilate the palate."
Poured from a growler (keg kicked while filling) into a pint glass
It's good. But honestly head hunter is still better.
"got it in a trade. very good and rounded DIPA but for me it was too sharp and sweet. however, i would order it again if i saw it!"

"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness.

got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
Canned 10/31/18
"Picked-up 6 cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton this past Saturday. Canned-on date of 10/31/18. My 24th brew reviewed from these guys. Very solid, not mind-blowing, middle of the pack of TH for me."
16-oz can 10/31/18 poured slowly into a 20-oz. mug produced a finger sized fizzy and foamy white head with short retention and minimal lacing.
Solid beer. Pour is hazy orange. Taste is combination of both bitter and sweet. Citrus smell with pleasant mustiness. Overall very smooth with solid balance and feel.
Bright pours a murky dark golden color with a thick and foamy complex head. The smell is dank with a grassy note and over ripened fruit. Big citrus flavors including grapefruit and tangerine with a floral component. The taste hits with a bitter hoppiness but quickly balanced out with sweet fruits such as grapefruit and pineapple coupled with a light malt bill. Overall it's a solid DIPA with a medium body and big resinous mouth feeel.
Canned 1/30/18 - Opened 9/18/18 & 10/18
Pour a nice hazy yellow. Very nice lookin beer.

"Second time having this beer, still fantastic. Beautiful color, almost peachy just like the taste and aroma. The whole experience with this beer is all about stone fruits and melon. Mouthfeel is nice, not thick and chewy like some hazy IPA's can be, more refreshing and easy to drink."
"Pulpy yellowish-orange brew, opaque in thicker glasses and hazily translucent in thinner glasses. Pours a big, frothy, snow white head with excellent retention and lacing."
"if you're ever in the norcal area, you must stop in and try moonraker. numerous good beers, Dojo is the best"
Received in a trade and shared with JLindros.
Thanks to rudzud
"Pours a turbid peach color with a frothy white head. Nose is of pale malts, tropical fruit and citrus pith. Taste of mellow mangos, grapefruit pith, light pinnaple and sticky malt. A bit of light grass/earthyness in there too. Medium creamy body with nice pungent citrus rine bitter finish."
Fresh 16oz can into tulip.

"On tap at Prison City Pub and Brewery in Auburn, NY."
"Revisiting this beer based on tasting notes, and I can't say that Paste Magazine's recent blind test (https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/247-of-the-best-american-ipas-blind-tasted-and-ran.html?p=4) does it any sort of disservice. Hazy orange, with a borderline pink hue. This is basically the beer version of Sunny-D. Big papaya, citrus, and pineapple aromas on the nose, followed by a massive punch of the same flavors on the body. Medium-bodied and satisfyingly drinkable. This is honestly the best beer that Upstate NY makes, and I'm proud to say that it's local. I hope that the folks at Prison City bring this one out year-round."

Working from memory...
"16 ounce prowler into tulip glass, filled on 11/4/2017. Pours fairly crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Nice appearance, despite lack of carbonation. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, white bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, white bread, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, white bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Mild carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, grainy, sticky, and fairly resinous/rind balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, a mildly increasing warmth of 9.5% after the finish. Overall this is an amazing DIPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the ABV. Even with the lack of carbonation in this prowler, this was still a winner. Great mix of dank and vibrant hop complexity; with a really lightweight malt body for the ABV from the rice as expected. Just enough there to balance the fairly aggressive bitterness. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Poured in tap into a snifter. A slightly hazy golden color with a modest white head. Nice retention in the glass. Bright piney aroma with a hint of orange tastes like a well-crafted old-school IPA with heavy pine, bitter orange, and bready malt. A clean, dry finish. ABV is well hidden. Overall a great DIPA especially if you like piney and earthy notes."
"A: Bright, deep gold with a clean white head that's almost unnoticeably tinted. A nice cap remains on top and leaves some legs and webbing well down the glass."
"Straw yellow in color with a half inch of tightly knit bright white. Heavy lacing. The aroma is predominantly of fragrant floral, some tropical hops, and light malt. I'm tasting tropical hops and light sour dough malt. The mouth is lightly sticky and chewy, but overall fairly smooth."

Flavor is really delicious. Not much hop bite, but lots of light stone fruits and a very well rounded flavor. Overall, a great beer that stands out a bit even in San Diego."
Picked up a 64 oz growler at the brewery on 2-21-17 for $16.71. Shared at the Coyotes-Sabres tailgate on 2-26-17.
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a slight dark burnt orange almost brown color with a sly transparency about it. Carbonation runs up at a nice pace to fill a nice thin foamy white head. Little bit of messy thin lacing all around. The smell starts danky sweet onion with a menancing resin hop bittersweetness rolling in underneath, but then protrudes a big hop burn dankiness as it continues to warm. The flavor takes in a big danky sweet onion sticky hop burn with big sweet resinous tongue ripping stickiness. Sweet to bitter grassy edge. Combined sticky resinous ""green"" (fresh) to danky sweet oniony aftertaste charging into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a super sipping sticky feel hitting my tongue. Harshness of the hops hit pretty sharp and bitter. Big hop throat burn. Overall, wow, how old or how young is this? Though it kinda reminds of a day old SN Hoptimum, the hop throat burn is big on this one. Still, I liked it a lot as I believe that’s what the brewer intended."
"Had this at Mikro Beer Bar in CT. Sean Lawson came in and brought some beers you would not find in CT. This is a dangerously great beer. Color was darker than most DIPA almost red, great on the nose. Taste and feel are the stars. No way you are thinking 11% abv that's the dangerous part. Enjoy with restraint."
"Purchased by standing in line in a parking lot at Mad River. Poured half of this into a mason jar with a handle from Dan & Whit's in Norwich, VT. Enjoyed while watching Michigan throttle Penn State in football. Color is dark orange, minimal foam. Smell and taste are the best part of this beer, which is preferable, right? Specifically, it has that barn-like smell that little craft breweries seem to manufacture. It smells like people gathered around a campfire, with one guy's truck playing a live Phish show that no one's really listening to that closely, and everyone opening up their cooler to reveal their secret treasures of beer. It tastes like something that wouldn't be out of place coming from Hill Farmstead. It's not a huge flavor to me, but it tastes warmly pleasant. The alcohol does not overwhelm, even though there is an overwhelming amount of alcohol in this thing: 11.2%! Ah, well. I'd drink it again, if ever I could find it."
Bottle shared by Barry- thanks dude.
"First of all, this beer does not drink like a 11% IPA. It is amazing how hoppy and smooth it is, lacking that alcohol presence of Lawson's Triple IPA. I am blown away by the drinkability of this beer. It's a refreshing oily hop bomb!"
"I've been waiting to try this for a long time. Finally got my hands on some. Pours a very hazy, deep golden color with fluffy white head. Aroma is pretty powerful. Light citrus with lots of pine. I also smell some malt sweetness and a touch of alcohol which isn't surprising for an 11% beer. Taste is potent to say the least. Lots of pine and earthy dankness. The citrus is there, but the pine is the star. I can definitely taste alcohol though. This beer is ridiculously smooth for 11%, but the alcohol is not totally hidden. I think it's impossible to hide 11% ABV. "
"Pours an orange-gold with a half inch, bright white cap. Nose expresses citrus, pith and mango. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of tangerine and an earthy/herbal/piney bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an oily texture and an even carbonation. All and all, a solid DIPA - very piney with hints of tropical fruit."
"Much better out of a glass than a can. Drinking from can it has a weird spicy/fruity character that persists through the finish, possibly exacerbated by carbonation. In glass it opens up and melds into a still somewhat unique but enjoyable pint. The spicy/fruity is still there in the nose, but not nearly as challenges me to drink."
"6/16/18: $8 20 ounce pour into tulip glass at Half Acre Lincoln Ave. Brewery. Golden murky pour, slight white lacing. Strong hops aroma, balanced with lemon and citrus. Bitter taste, hops strong and pleasant, with lemon and other fruit offset, nice balance. Firm mouth feel, thin texture. Great summer drinking, overall very good pour."
"Had this on 2018-06-19 in Bolingbrook, IL from a 16oz canned on 2018-05-24"
"In the glass is a bright clear amber and a fluffy white head . Scents of dank hops with a mild fruity background. Nice pleasant bitterness , oily, juicy, nice big level. Not sweet. Light to medium mouthfeel, clean finish.great beer."
"Poured 16oz can into sniffer. Clear yellow/orange with a 2 finger white head and some spotty lacing. Very aromatic hops that showcase citrus, tropical fruit and light resin. Vienna malts give it some bready caramel sweetness. Flavor has tropical fruit like pineapple and mango with citrus notes. The malt is very light and only adds a hint of sweetness for balance. A lighter body and ample carbonation that finishes slightly dry. A good IPA, but something is missing for me in the flavor."
"Canned 5/23/2018 and poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a hazy, golden-honey color with over a finger of fluffy, bright-white head and copious lacing. The nose is fragrant with tangerine, lemon, ripe melon, onion, vanilla, and soft floral hops. It has a really nice flavor opening with tart lemon and a hint of grapefruit. There follows a touch of melon and sweetness from the Vienna malt. The Citra hops add a nice bitter bitter taste but without a strong bite. I think the best thing about this ale is its mouth feel: plush, creamy, and silky smooth; it feels great going down. It has pleasant carbonation and the 7.5% ABV gives it a nice pop for a single IPA. Overall, I really like this ale: in a world of gimmicky IPA's, a simple brew featuring Citra hops and Vienna malt is always welcome. Beer Hates Astronauts is big enough to accompany a meal of seafood or a burger but it's fine for casual drinking. In fact, it's hard to limit yourself to a single can or pour. I'm glad this beer made its way to New Jersey fairly fresh and I'll look for it again."
A: The beer is clear yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that left a collar consisting of medium sized bubbles around the edge of the glass.
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. About 3 weeks old. Pours a slightly cloudy darker golden copper body, one finger white head, good retention, splotchy lacing. Smell is bright, freshly squeezed tropical fruit and grapefruit. Big wafts of tropical fruit align nicely with a bit of floral/herbal resin, light caramel. Flavour doesn't really bring that big tropical fruit across, though. It is more of a balanced grapefruit and light caramel flavour, a bit of resinous, slightly dank bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry, with a deliciously mildly bitter resin finish. Smell is almost what I want from all IPAs, although it didn't quite deliver on the palate. Very good IPA with a big tropical aroma."
A-a clear golden yellow with a thin layer of white head
"Pours a nearly-translucent orange with a half-finger of head that dissipates quickly. Orange, lemongrass, and floral hops on the nose, a bit more dank resin on the palate. Good balance of hops and malts in the flavor profile, and maybe a hint of vanilla. I'm not sure what else makes this better than so many other IPAs like it, but this has a really appealing quality that I can't nail down."
"pours a clear gold with a solid, looks pretty nice"

Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
New England IPA hazy. Less hop aroma than expected. Nice juicy hop fruit profile.
"Cloudy, apricot color. Lasting, but minor, head. Good rings for lace. "
Not as exceedingly fragrant as some of there other offerings. But an awesome Double Ipa
"Pours a hazed a floaty filled, straw color with a finger of eggshell colored head. Stellar lacing, insane haze, decent head retention "
"Even at over 6 months since bottling this beer is hoppy, and tasty like a fresh bottle of any DIPA out there, Amazing smooth mouthfeel and a fruity and piney aroma."
"The beer was a beauty to look at. And the smell had a lovely bouquet of hops and tropical fruits, especially pineapple and passionfruit. But the taste was so mellow and watered down compared to the taste. I love TG, but this one just wasn't for me I guess. Not that it isn't lovely and bright, but I found it being dry, bland, and over carbonated on the finish."
My old neighbor is sharing a bottle of this with me whilst I'm in town for son's hockey tournament. It poured a murky yellow with no head and no lace. The scent had bitter fruit hop. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with juicy fruit presence. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.
"Very disappointing. I bought in a bomber, and I'm actually not looking forward to drinking the rest."
"this is really great stuff, cool to find it on tap. i like this better than some other beers from these guys in the same style, and dont really mind the haze here as much a i have in some of them. this smells insane, straight dry hopped glory, fresh cut pineapple, mango, and crushed white grape, it smells like white sangria straight up! of course there is some pae maltiness to support, as well as a vegetal hop bitterness thats rather obvious, but the aroma of this hop bill is amazing, goes right to the dome. its not quite as pronounced and unique to me in the flavor, but its not way off either, and i am introduced to some peach and apricot nectar character from the hops that i really like. some mosaic in here i think, but its hard to pick out what else. definite pineapple juice here along with some fresh citrus, so forward and good. i like that its also as bitter as it is, nice to have one of these juicy ones also pack a little punch at the finish, its not over the top or harsh, but it reminds you this is a double ipa. fuller body with the haze but not at all sweet, and a lot of carry for the hops. decent carbonation and a long, citrusy juicy orangey hop finish. great beer, worth the hype."

"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
