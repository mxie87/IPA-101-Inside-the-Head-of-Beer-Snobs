Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip 
"Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass at Beer Head Pub in Schaumburg, IL. I loved this beer. The appearance was a cloudy gold orange color with a nice white head. The aroma was citrus and hops. Outstanding taste."
"Had on tap at the Firehouse in Normal, IL."
This beer has been on my 'bucketlist' for quite some time. Finally distributing out to CO.
Received a 4pack thanks to Beer Temple Chicagoâ€™s great online service. 
"Growler purchased from Societe Brewing Company in San Diego, CA."
On tap at the brewery. Flashback to Tired Hands as they'll only pour me two tasters.
Nelson hop showcase. Super classic for the hop style- a little tropical fruit with a nice Nelson zip. A little bit spicy. 
Taster at GABF 2016.
"Taster: Fresh floral, honey and citrus notes. Light on the malt, which suits my preference. The finish ends a little short with some bitter citrus. Great carb and mouthfeel. Overall very enjoyable beer."
Type: 6-oz. draft
"Best IPA you can get, if you can get it. These guys don't bottle their beer, so if you can't visit the brewery, or if you can't find a restaurant or bar that has it, you are out of luck."
"Served on-tap in a Shaker pint glass at The Hopping Pig in San Diego, CA. Reviewed from notes."
"Toronado - San Francisco, CA - draft"
Societe makes greet beers. This was a very smooth IPA and probably the first west coast IPA I really enjoyed. Nice hop taste and smooth finish. Definitely recommend it.
"On tap at BBQ 152 in Gilroy, Ca."
"Draught pour at City Beer into a chalice glass. Pours light golden yellow wit a finger of white head that left some variable lacing. Nose a bit faint citrus. Taste more than makes it up with traditional West Coast IPA attributes. Dry citrus punch in the mouth with some pine to boot. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation solid, wit a finish that's a bit dry and filled with citrus astringency. Delicious beer I can't wait to have again!"
Poured from a growler - thank you Tony for the experience.
"The Nelson hops give this IPA a very subtle wine-like smell and taste, a very unique and fruity addition to a solid IPA. This has got to be one of the best beers I've had! Very San-Diegan, a total hop bomb, but dangerously poundable."
A: Citrusy/lightly tropical hops upfront with a touch of malt sweetness. 
Incredible
got lucky on this one and found it at a beer fest. all their beers i tried were very good. great smell and color. I wish i couldve got more than a small sample
Clear bright straw gold color with a small head and thin lacing.
"Bright yellow pour, tons of haze, virgin white head almost half an inch. Aroma is just pure kick ass. Citra hops galore. All the tropical fruits in the aroma. "
"Only my second offering from Societe, but it gave further credit to a friend of mine who constantly boasts that they're the best brewery in San Diego. This is a well-balanced IPA that is very easy to drink. Looking forward to more from these guys in the future."
"12 oz Pint at Churchills in San Marcos.Simply amazing IPA. Super balanced, nice and smooth finish. One of the better San Diego county IPA's I've had the pleasure to try."
On tap at brewery.
Great IPA. Full hoppy spot on So Cal. Smooth finish. Way good and exceeds the hype.
Pretty much the perfect example of San Diego IPA. Hoppy with pale color. Very good.
"A very interesting IPA! Different than the usual, but not too different..."
had really high expectations. a good solid beer i thought. my drinking buddies thought so too. found them by accident at gabf. well done. need to find them online stores
Great dipa with really good up front fresh hop smell and a very well balanced hoppy/malty finish. I prefered the Elevated Ipa but this was very tasty to try
A - Pours a hazy medium light gold color with an ultra thing lacing ring.
22 oz bomber poured into snifter.
"Bomber. Pours opaque orange, thick white head. Smell is sweet citrusy orange, makes you wanna just take a big gulp. The taste is delish, juicy orange and tangerine with the perfect malt sweet balance. Finishes semi dry and some dank earthiness plates out on the tongue at the end. Mouthfeel is soft and slick. First time trying this one and it did not disappoint. Outstanding."
"Sampled at SAVOR 2015. Very clean hoppy citrus. Not ground breaking, but solid."
"Several draft pours at DC Savor, including my second pour of the night so palate was a blank slate. Could not tell if this keg was old, but it was a bit of a malt bomb, old-school IPA. Was quite disappointed."
"At being a piney, resinous, clear bodied, West Coast IPA, it excels tremendously. Compares to Pliny but I think this is better. All around fantastic flavors and aromas."
"First beer from Societe and I am thoroughly impressed. Hops, heavy citrus, and some pine. Tasty and well balanced. Very East Coast, a la Alchemist and Trillium."
Tried via fresh 32 oz Growler. Excellent light IPA with an almost Smooth Vanilla finish.
Pours a beautiful sunburst orange with a slight haze that looks delicious.
"Honestly, one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Really easy drinking. Packed with flavor. Excellent."
"Pours a pale golden color. Has an amazing tropical fruit aroma. Taste has a huge burst of juiciness. Great feel with perfect thickness and carbonation. Overall, a great beer, would order again without hesitation."
"Unfortunately, this pour from growler was mostly flat...a gift from a good friend who just wanted to share the opportunity, but alas, by the time I had it, the beer had lost a lot of its freshness and punch. Looking forward to trying it again, but more fresh."
"Reviewed from notes, I had this in the Societe tasting room. Taking a break from a long work week, I decided to spend the weekend in San Diego, & this place was at the top of my list of places to visit. "
