"Citra forward (pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine etc), mild bitter finish, it is good but doesn’t really stand out from the crowd though that said it is still quietly very good"
What?!?! This beer is hop magic!
"The stamp is a bit smudged, but it looks like the bottom of the can: says: ""CANNED ON 08/02/18 F4392 09:30"""
Wow isn't that the most meanest & toughest beer can artwork that I have laid eyes on. It looks the part of an IPA. I was expecting more an east coast IPA that had a fair amount of malts to go along with bitter hoppiness that these beers tend to bring to the table. I am a little disappointed in this IPA guys. Well it does taste edgy & bold as what is expected with this type of beer can artwork. Cheers! B-
"Poured out of growler 4 days after buying. Nothing fancy here, just a simple but beautifully crafted single hip ipa that checks off all the boxes. Terrific!"
On tap at Grizzly's Plymouth.
"I wish I could post pictures with my reviews. This beer almost glows a stunning orange and the beer tastes as good as it looks. Hazy NE style IPA, so juicy and citrus/fruity. I've had few beers I crave more than this... now if only it could be readily had in the twin cities!!"
My favorite Disgruntled beer. I also love Reaper. Juicy and the perfect hop presence. Every batch is a little different but it is consistently my favorite MN IPA.
I've had this before but never rated it. Always enjoyed it. Looks the part with the cloudy orange juice appearance. Nice fruity aroma which leans toward the tropical fruits but definitely includes citrus fruit notes. Really a nice aroma to this. 
I really liked this one. Some variations in the batches but over all very good!
"This beer pours a completely opaqu dirty yellow with a fairly head. is hugely tropical, with passionfruit, pineapple, grapfruit, tangerine, mango, and guava. The flavor is joyously juicy, with loads of passionfruit, guava, pineappl, and mango, as well as grapefruit peel, kiwi, watermelon, honeydew, and a decent bitter pithy finish. The mouthfeel is quite soft and pillowy, with fulsome carbonation. Overall this beer has a wonderfully descriptive name - it is stupid how good this is. Great texture, huge aroma, gorgeous flavor, and just enough bitterness for balance."
"Look: A dull, cloudy orange appearance."
"LOOKS: A hazy, burnt lemon with a finger of white foam that slowly fades to a ring. Fair lacing down the glass."
Pours out a cloudy straw color. The head is off-white with moderate retention. Lacing is moderate as well.
"Hot shit 3 years ago, not so much now. The competition kicks this beer in the nuts and says fuck you old man."
"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks. "
"Picked up a few dry cases at, wait for it...Total Wine..Huh? yep, Total had 4 cases on hand and I helped myself to all of them. Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can. Hopefully New Zeland will cut loose enough Nelson hops for Beachwood BBQ to put Alpha Supreme back on the menu, we can only hope."
"Bottled 9/5/18, consumed 9/22/18"
Poured into a hybrid glass from a 12oz bottle
"Pours an opaque orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, papaya, and watermelon. Nice tropical fruit aromatics, with light wheaty, biscuity malt notes behind. Flavor profile is grapefruit, papaya, orange, and light mango with light wheaty, biscuity malt notes behind. Big flavor with an aroma to match. Still, it doesn't scream tropical fruits or get right in your face to announce its presence. Good balance here. Mouth feel is lightly grainy, with a fuzzy, dry finish. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a splendid beer with big hop notes in both the aroma and flavor profile, while still allowing malts to peek through. Make no mistake, the hops are the story here though. "
"Looks great and smells fine but compared to DDH Fort Point this is a bit of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Melcher Street, this was the middle of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!"
"Another excellent DDH Street Series IPA. This one is really smooth with excellent hop flavor, though it doesn't explode in the mouth like DDH Farnsworth did for me. The drinkability factor is high due to the mouth-feel. Overall, an excellent mid-ABV IPA that is a pleasure to drink."
Look- Poured aggressively into a Trillium tulip glass. With a two finger head. Picture does not do the color of this beer justice. Its a beautiful opaque and turbid yellow. 4.25
Canned 11 days ago.
Canned 8 days ago. My 50th review of a Trillium beer!
On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of orange and tropical fruit. Tastes of tropical fruit and orange. Very bright. Some pale malt with a touch of sweetness. Low bitterness. Medium body. Good.
"Had this on tap at the Barking Dog Ale House in Haverhill, MA. The beer had a very murky orange appearance with no head. The aromas were strongly of orange juice but i could sense some lemon citrus. Very sweet and tangy, like orange juice, in flavor. This was a very crisp, carbonated beer; extremely refreshing. Overall, a great beer to have with a meal thanks to its incredible mouthfeel."
"Hazy and juicy, with a hint of mango in the after taste. Moderate aroma. No hoppy bite to the finish. Very ""New-Englandy"" style."
"A: The beer is rather hazy light yellow in color and poured with a quarter finger high bright white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and some lacing down the sides of the glass."
An awesome ipa with a full flavor of mosaic hops and an exceptional amount of floral undertone. When you pour it you will smell sunflowers and with the pineapple quenching flavor it adds to an experience any ipa lover will crave.
Best IPA in TX hands down
Strange beer
Made an account just to rate this beer 5/5. Best beer ive had coming out of texas.
Crisp and delicious grapefruit with a pineapple finish. Fruity Mosaic hops all day against a light backbone. Very good IPA.
"Pours a slightly hazy, grapefruit juice color with a big thick head. Much carbonation to be seen. Lacing is good. Has a different aroma in that hoppy smell that I would call, delicious. Has a nice flavor and the hop character comes on the back end. It's got a thin mouthfeel for an IPA and goes down fast and easy. Overall it's nice beer that drinks easy and not overpowering in the hops or the alcohol. It's unfiltered and unpasteurized. Mosaic whole cone hops are used. I would buy this one again. Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle dated 07/03/18 into an Imperial Nonic. It's big enough to share and somewhat pricey. A good starter for the non-IPA folks to try. www.lonepint.com"
16.9oz bottled 7-3-18
This is a review of Project Dank Summer 2018 Edition.
Rich copper/amber color. A good creamy looking head. Nice lacing. Excellent aroma. Hops are inviting. Taste follows the nose and it’s very good and it reminds me so much of Cedar Creeks’ Dankosaurus. Mouthfeel is smooth and the bitterness is just right. This is the one you want at La Cumbre Taproom.
"Thanks to leftpaw for kicking one of these down on a trip. Pours a darker golden color. Solid 3/4"" white head on it with ample retention, especially for a beer with such a high hop/hop oil to it. Those hops aren't the most pungent in the nose, they come off kind of restrained if anything. Present, but not overpowering or even to levels I would appreciate. Went in the direction of pineapple and tangerine mostly."
CAN: Currently #1 on the Top New Mexico beers list. 473ml format. Best before: 09/27/18. Pull-tab can. Bloody fantastic label art.
"A: The beer is slightly hazy yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a short white head that died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass."
One of the best double IPAs I have had.
Clear orange with thick head.
"On tap, pours a clear light gold. A finger of white foam leaves spotty lacing. A very well-made West Coast IPA. Great combination of citrus and pine, with a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Super stuff."
Appearance: Arrives with a slightly hazy golden color and a frothy head; decent lacing action
Had on-tap at Cross Street Chicken and Beer in San Diego. Poured into a pint glass. 
Bottle dated 08/14/18 -- didn't pick it up until 11/02/18 and not opened until the date of this review.
"Skip lunch. Wait for Dinner. This has practically no hops profile by comparison, although it is very smooth."
"Pours a slightly murky yellow/orange with normal carbonation. Aroma is of tropical fruit, juice. Taste is much the same with a hint of malt, not much bitterness. This one really tastes like hawaiin punch without the sweetness. Very well balanced IPA."
"Pours a standard orange with an unfiltered, hazy look that becomes a little more hazy as the lower ounces of the bottle are poured into the glass. Head formation is two fingers of stark white foam, with good retention. Aroma is pine, floral, herbal, and orange. Pine really stands out in this mix, but without an encumbering bitterness it often brings. It's a simple, clean profile. It's not loud and boyish like some other IPAs. Flavor profile has more citrus up front, with pine, herbal, and floral hops falling in behind. Again, well reserved and clean. Toasty, biscuity, wheaty malt notes spring through, firming up the flavor profile and delivering a balanced relationship between hops and malts. Mouth feel is lightly fuzzy and velvety, with a medium consistency, heightening the experience and enjoy-ability. Overall, a balanced and nuanced IPA that doesn't favor hops drastically over malts, and instead utilizes both to form a splendid balance. "
"Lunch is an excellent IPA with a citrusy/piney fragrance that gives way to the same in taste, with the slight pine notes lingering a bit on the palate providing a refreshingly smooth finish. The color is an amber tint with some deep browns and dark oranges. It has fine lacing that cascades quickly down the glass with each sip. It's best enjoyed after it's had a good chill and then a few minutes at room temp before opening, but you knew that."
"500 ml bottle, dated 09/11/18. Poured into Lexan tulip. Thanks to canconphilly!"
"The appearance was a burnt golden color with a one finger white foamy head that held up for great retention and dissipated at a nice pace into a concave sort of glazing all around. The smell had some sweet danky onion, tropical fruity bliss and as it warmed bitter piney/resinous aromas wrapping together. The taste had the bitterness of the pine coinciding with the tropical fruity hops. Bitter juicy to semi-sprucy aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a good sipping to almost sneaky sessionable feel to it. Carbonation feels good for an AIPA allowing enough bitterness all around. Overall, I’d say this was an exceptional AIPA that I would love to have again."
"Green foiled top bottle (date not found on bottle) poured into large IPA glass. Looks is a hazy copper color with a nice white head that remains, lacing rings the glass when consumed. The smell is lightly fruited with pine notes and subtle caramel malt. The taste is way more malty than the smell, slight oniony notes come through mid palate. The feel through me off, especially for Lawson's! Definitely phenolic harsh bitterness that lingers around and a lighter feel overall. Overall I am disappointed, but hey as a Homebrewer for 9 years I know that some batches are better than others. Cheers."
"It's kind of weird having this next to Sips. To me there was nothing that tropical about this. Floral, piney aroma into a pretty bitter taste. Smooth and well executed, but more on the malty bitter side. More of the solid ipa of yesteryear, meaning this would have played ball in 2012, but now is outclassed by many other tasty ipas"
"This is clearly a beer that did not forget about caramel malt. From the dark orange appearance, through the sweet aroma, to the chewy, smooth body."
"On draft, about a 12oz. snifter at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT."
"World class IPA. Complex hop flavor, easy to drink with a crisp citrus finish."
"Great golden color. The Citra hops are the prominent note here, I think. Splendid."
10 oz pour at taproom. Good stuff! Blend of hops packed more of a punch than single-hop Half-Light Sunbeam. Upside: lots of flavor. Downside: bitter.
"Poured from a growler purchased 2 hrs ago, into the test glass."
"Draught @ The Foundry: This one pours a murky golden color. There was a small white head that left some lacing. Good nose. Mainly tropical hops. Some citrus too. The taste was very good. Not too much bitterness, but lots of jucy hops. Tropical and citrus flavors. Nice!"
"Had this on tap at the Foundry. The beer had a cloudy, dark orange appearance with a medium thick head that lasted awhile. Aromas were sharp with very vocal orangepeel mixed with various citrus smells and piney hops, Taste followed the nose with a very citrus-y, tangy, and juicy drink that did not overpower the flavor senses. Very easy to drink with my meal at the bar. Mouthfeel was interestingly silky in texture with a light, refreshing body. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this beer; appearance, aromas, and flavors were awesome."
West coast meets East coast... Awesome beer!!!!
"Drank on tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA"
"Heist kills it once again. Ive had this beer the last four times they canned it. Never disappoints,murky orange color. Tastes like OJ but 10x better! I live in East Charlotte and there are plenty of breweries trying to do this hazy ipa thing. Heist is on point 100%"
"Can dated 8/7/18! Drank this one exactly one month later! Looks like murky hop juice. Smells and tastes like just what they were going for berry dank juice! The feel is soft and velvety. Overall delicious, I want another!!"
From the can: 
"Pours an opaque pale orangish-yellow with a finger and a half of stark white foam on top. Head retention is good with a few dense strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is mango, papaya, tangerine, orange, and light biscuit malts. Aroma is huge and flavorful with a splendid collection of tropical fruit and citrus aromas. Flavor profile is mango, papaya, melon, pineapple, tangerine, and clementine. It has a light backbone of biscuit malts. Mouth feel is a little chalky and grainy with a fine fizziness. It has a medium thickness. Overall, a delightfully aromatic and flavorful IPA. Not much perceivable bitterness, just dense notes of sugary citrus. "
"Pour is hazy yellow. Tall, fluffy, Whitehead the Fades slowly to a rocky head with good lacing."
Appearance - Pours cloudy light yellow with a big fluffy white head nice amount of lacing.
"Has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. I was quite excited, as I love the style, the ratings are high and this is the first time I saw this sold in Toronto."
I like I like
"At $2.64 per 12 oz bottle I had expected a very good product and it was very good; however, was it exceptional for the value? It certainly was flavorful; however, it was not hoppy like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which I do like. (Not associated.) It had very good taste, a very good feel and smell but that extra hoppiness that one expects with a craft brewed IPA just was not there. It was certainly worth buying to try and I may even buy some more in the future but I think I'll have to wait for it to be on sale."
"Used to be good. Sold out. Cranking them out ad nauseum. Now just a shelf turd, 15 months after bottle date."
"Smooth delicious IPA. Many tropical notes, not too hoppy or overpowering. Slightly sweet from the fruity flavors."
"Appearance: bright golden color (think macro pilsener) with very slight haze – not NE IPA-style, more like a slight chill haze. The head forms a ½-finger of off-white with fair retention."
My standard go-to semi-premium IPA
"Have had this beer multiple times from both a can and from a tap. The pour results in a cloudy dark-orange/amber look with a thick off white head. The smell is strong and features a plethora of fruits, mostly citrus and light. Taste is reflective of the smell with a citrus hop flavor that has a slight bitterness. Mouth feel is light with moderate carbonation. Overall, it is fruity but in a refreshing way and not sour. There is still some bitterness and hops present. This is one of my favorite IPA's."
"Got in a BIF from KMitch. 12 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carrbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.6%. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish, not overly aggressive. Not as intensely tropical/juicy as I expected, but rather old school feeling IPA. Nice Centennial, Galaxy, and Citra profile. Centennial seems to have the most presence. Very juicy, dank, and earthy balanced hop complexity; nice bready malt backbone, with minimal residual sweetness from lingering dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example. No real complaints."
"Bought this at Trader Joe's. Checkout lady said they couldn't keep it in stock. I'm on the hunt for local beers that kick ass, and this beer has been highly rated."
Damn fine beer here. To the specifics....
Big thanks to JBowenGeorgia
L - 2-finger stubborn offwhite head atop a translucent yellow body.
Tap to pint glass @ Russian River Brewing tap 
Jeez this beer is always awesome.
"On tap at the source. Poured into a pint glass at happy hour for $3.75, a light golden color with a one-inch thick white head which lingers long. Aroma is floral and bright citrus. Flavor is clean and very hop forward. Bitter finish. Packs quite a hop punch. Easy drinking. Seek this out."
Goofy can but I had to try having enjoyed other beers from this brewery. Glad to see this in Wegmans in southeastern PA. Picked up a 4 pack for $11. Enjoyed one from the can with pizza on a hot summer day. Thought it was delicious. Glad I have three more. Great citrus and pine scent and taste is clearly Citra with nice bitterness. I detect a grape flavor and found it easy to drink. Another winner from Half Acre. Date on can 5/23/18. Enjoying on the east coast in easy July. Love it.
Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 6/11/18; into a pub glass.
Never thought I’d dislike a Half Acre beer... but there’s a first for everything. 
This is the best beer ive ever had. Perfect amount of citrus and mouthfeel. ABV is a perfect amount for me as I find beers over 7% to be boozy and not enjoyable to actually drink. DEAR CALUSA - make this your flagship and not focus. Much more drinkable and flavorful!
Hazy though not as hazy as Focus.
Hazy IPA packed with citrus and hops. Juice bomb!
"On-tap at Caluso Brewing, Sarasota, FL"
"Had on tap at PCBP. Excellent beer. Full NEIPA flavor (Citra and Mosaic in this case) with all th juiciness and citrus. Unsure but Vermont yeast seems to really bring it all together. Big malt backbone. A little bright on the carbonation, but I just like my beers closer to foam natural carbonation."
"Dank and delicious. Look is mostly clear with not a ton of lacing, but everything else about this beer is incredible. I drank this after Mass Riot and they are very different beers but equally delicious."
"This beer pours a golden orange amber color with a two finger, foamy white head. Retention is great as I had a one finger cap for the duration of the beer."
One of the best beers I have had in a while. Ben (the brewer at PC) continues to create outstanding beers. This may be his best yet.
"L - A mixture of dull orange and bright yellow. Not quite straw but the color of freshly blended bananas. Unfiltered, turbid, hazy etc etc. No light passes through. Completely opaque. Frothy white head."
"Pours a foggy golden. Good aromatics. A great combo of tropical fruit and grapefruit. A little bit of bite, but no burn like hoppy beers on the old profile have seemed to have."
Excellent beer in all phases. Tastes and smells like original Pseudo Sue when it was growler only on draft in Decorah. Similar full on citra hop profile. Refreshing but full bodied IPA. Huge citrus nose with a hint of melon.
Really hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma has sweet vanilla notes and juicy hops. Taste is sweet and hoppy with juicy tropical notes and low bitterness.
"A lighter, let’s say, summer version of PtE that’s cut from the same cloth. Absolutely worth the effort to try."
Served on tap in a conical pint glass at Toronado Bar in San Francisco. Purchase to contrast with Pliny the Elder.
Shimmering burnt gold with a thick off-white foam that leaves drooping curtains of lace all over the glass.
"Bottled today, classic 510ml bottle."
This is about the most traditional/classic west coast IPA as one can find. Piney and Floral and a moderate to heavy bitter finish. A little to heavy on the pine and bitterness for me but I respect this for a very well made beer.
Bottle shared by Sylvain.
I've heard great things...now I've tasted them. 
Pours a deep golden with whitish frothy two finger head. Aroma is slightly tropical but heavier to pine and grass. Flavour starts with a hint of sweetness then moves to earthy pine and grass notes. Hop bite up front is assertive but not off putting. Finishes with an earthy chewy dryness.
"This review is one of two fresh hop ale reviews - the other being Yellow Dog Brewery’s Alpha Dog 2106 release. I made these reviews as a challenge by an acquaintance who said that Alpha Dog was a way better beer than Driftwood’s Sartori Harvest. As I have not had the privilege to try either until now, I figured a good head to head taste off was in order (pun intended). See here (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35919/193023/?ba=JonCorbett#review) for my review of Alpha Dog. "
Got on a CANBIF trade! Thx westcoastbeergeek! Served at 4deg C in a draught glass
Package: 650 ml bottle.
Headed back for 1 more fight before making the trip back to FL.
Holy mackerel. Massive hops without destroying my tongue.
Appearance: Amber with very light haziness.
"Light hop haze with huge citrusy, fruity aroma. Very tasty IPA. Get some malt base with massive hop flavors. A tiny bit drier than expected, but overall a very fine IPA."
"In my unprofessional opinion the Acerbic is the epitome of what an American IPA should be. The Nose, Mouthfeel, Taste, Color, Head Retention and Mouthfeel are perfect."
"Acerbic is my go to when visiting Broomtail. It has been a super consistent great tasting IPA. It has a nice dark gold almost amber color. Darker than most IPA's I've had but the body is well balanced and mouthfeel is just right when the hops hit your nostrils and tongue. If you like a hearty hoppy IPA, this unique beer performs a good balancing act. The only ""negative"" is you have to be careful about how easily these go down."
Aroma: The beer has a very mild to strong presence of hops aroma.
The best IPA I have ever had. The hop profile is perfectly crafted to leave your palate with an amazing taste but does not overwhelm you. Each sip beckons your for another. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. The definition of a craft IPA.
Had this at the brewery. Pours nice filtered amber color with a small head. Had a nice malt backbone and not much hop bitterness. A definite English style IPA. Good but just another IPA. Nothing special about this.
"My favorite IPA. Drinkable, huge aroma and flavor, but almost no juicy haze."
"Had on tap. It tastes good, don't get me wrong, but it falls short for me as an ipa. Not nearly enough hop character in the taste or in the body. Good amount of malt and sweet finish than usual. Again tasty, but rated as an ipa it isn't complete enough"
On tap at the brewery.

"Copper color, 1/2"" white head. Aroma hit the hoppy grapefruit smells."
Type: 64-oz. growler
"Look- pours golden orange, cloudy from tons of tiny floaties; billowing foamy 2 finger head that recedes slowly; ample lacing"
Can. White head. Golden orange color.

Can from ABV. Canned 01 March 2018
"The Hop Shop that forms a line for extraterrestrial home brewers pours a laser beam yellow, whatever the hell that means. Brunch orange juice cocktail perhaps? It's yellowy orange and beautiful with a wispy white foam that leaves a fine film of bubbles wherever it has made contact."
16 oz can
"World class. This is in the same conversation as green, Julius and trilliums IPAs. Big notes of tropical fruit. Medium mouthfeel. Full haze. World class IPA"
"Being a big fan of Chuck's Hop Shop, I've wanted to get my hands on one of these for a while. Luckily, I had a friend visit from Seattle, that works there. My can was well over a month old, but was still juicy and hoppy. I'd love to try one that was fresher, I'm sure it would be even better."
"Really hazy yellow color with creamy, off-white head. Aroma is really hoppy with nice pineapple and mango juice but also some dank and grassy notes. Taste has tons of hops, dank, grassy, chives, hop resin, medium bitterness. Medium body with a really smooth mouthfeel. Awesome IPA, up there with the New England juice bombs."
"On tap in shaker pint at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT."
"Definitely one of the better Lawson's bottles that I've had. Not quite at the same level as Double and Triple Sunshine, but I'd say its right at the same level as SoS, but quite different."
This was an awesome beer. I 1st had it on tap at the Lawson's event (was the best beer I had there) and again last night when opened of the my bottles from the event. Definately in the same tier as SOS and the rest of the bigger IPAs! Well done!
"It pours a hazy yellow almost lemonade color with a frothy white head that a good lacing to the glass. The smell is lemon, grapefruit combination, taste is sweet to start than a mild hop bite comes through. Overall this is a well done drink and that is easy to enjoy."
Hazy pale yellow with a thick white foam dome leaving peaks of lace.
Appearance - Pours bright yellow with big light fluffy white head that dissipates to about a one inch cap and stays. Spotty lacing all around the glass.
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Very nice citrus aroma. Mainly orange. Mild piney resin. Somewhat juicy. Taste does still have some juicy orange, but it is definitely off at the end. A little more bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Still a good beer."
Round 2 with Parish! This was bottled on 11/2/17.
Hazy NEIPA. A bit more pine and bitterness with a less pillowy mouthfeel than the very best NEIPAs but this is still an excellent beer which I would gladly drink any time - and an argument could be made that the pine/bitterness makes this even better than a straight-up OJ NEIPA.
"awesome that my buddy was able to send a crowler of this out to me fresh from the brewery. its a beer i have been wanting to try since i first heard about it, and we cracked into it with much enthusiasm. it is plenty hazy, thats for sure, murky and thick, not particularly bright, but with gorgeous carbonation rising into a tall white head that holds well and leaves frothy lacing as it drinks down. the aroma is awesome, leafy vegetal and fresh, loaded with hops, almost at a max out point, really saturated and intense, heavily dry hopped and not at all unfamiliar to me. citra dominated, at least to me, in the aroma, lemon curd and zest, with some heftier hops in here too, simcoe perhaps, grapefruity with a pine aromatic, notes of confectioners sugar, white wheat earthiness grounding, mouthwatering but not so unique as i thought it would be for all of its acclaim. this is definitely citra driven, but i get more bitterness than i usually do from citra alone, i like that in an ipa like this, its needed, the juiciness is there, fresh and insanely dry hoppy, but the bitter side is welcomed here. fresh spruce, tangerine, oats and wheat for sure in the mash, oily too. i like how creamy this is in the feel, it supports the hops nicely and makes me think the haze is more of a natural thing than something contrived here, i like this kind of grain base in such a dry hopped beer, its needed. in the end, this was awesome, we all really liked it, but i wanted it to be more different than it is. this tastes like a whole lot of others right now, which i guess was a bit of a let down for me, it was memorable for quality but not for its flavor in any way, if that makes sense. better then most of the field in this category of ipa..."
"Let me just say, i almost cried when i had this beer. Its so delicious, so interesting, and has such a great hoopy taste. I would buy this en masse if i could, but its only sold at the pub. 10/10 flavor"
"Definitely has that NE haze. The aromas and flavors of mango, pineapple and faint passion fruit deliver on that expected juice bomb character. Seemed slightly green still, bet this would be better with another week or so on it."
"From a Crowler (12/18/16) poured into a tulip. Opened during a tasting of 4 different IPAs. This was the second to be tasted. Certainly looks the part of a hazy NEIPA, and smells of one, too. It pours a light amber color with a very deep haze. Decent head retention. The tropical aromas are there, but there's also a noticeable smell of malt/wheat bread. The taste is where this beer loses me compared to other NEIPAs - I'm guessing it's the yeast strain, but it picks up some of the fruity esters I would associate with a Kolsch. There's very little bitterness here... it's almost like a sparkling fruit juice or shandy, but with the faintest hint of pine to remind you it may be an IPA. The body is great - medium with good carbonation. Virtually zero dryness on the finish."
"I have been lucky enough to have had each of the releases, from the original to last week (yes the wait in lines is worth it). It may be me but each batch seems to get better. Hopefully with the expansion Mass Riot will be on year round or at least in a rotation with the Vermont Riot."
"32 oz. crowler. Very hazy orange. Smells of citrus, tropical fruits, and garlic hops. Doesn't smell sweet, but you can smell the oat additions. Tastes very much of oats as well. It's the dominant grain flavor. Orange hops with a strong garlic bite in the back end. Medium body. The oats give it some heft without sweetness. Almost has the body of a double IPA. Impressive."
A: Hazy pale orange in color
"Appearance: Pours a cloudy honey color with the bubble show forming the full three fingers; excellent retention, with copious clumps of lace"
Appearance - The beer poured a hazy yellow color with a white head.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy golden color. Aroma is fruity, hoppy and floral with a sweet background. Taste is balanced, citrusy and grainy with bitter citrus rind and grapefruit flavor."
Canned 4/11/18. I’m very happy to finally get my hands on some cans of Party Wave from the brewery without having to wait in a line. Kudos to Kane for really making their brewey experience smooth and effecient (worth noting I didn’t go on a release day). 
Decanted from a 16 oz (355 ml) can into a Kane snifter; canned on 04/11/18 and purchased at the brewery.
A very tasty lpa from Kane
On tap at Morris Tap And Grill in Randolph. Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Assertive aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Similar overall flavor profile.
COD 092217 Nose is pleasant. Perhaps better fresher.
Pours a beautiful orange yellow but very little head. 
"Hazy lemon drop/orange juice color with a furry, creamy, thick head of 2 fingers. Lots of lace behind. "
"Bought a 4-pack at the Congress Street brewery location. This beer has a very thick, dark orange appearance with a medium head that does dissipate with some patchy lacing. Aromas include some thick citrus hops with orangepeel and lemon. The taste follows the nose but is more vocal than the aromas. Tastes like carbonated, lightly boozy, orange juice. The mouthfeel is really good. Not too refreshing, but nothing overpowering; good carbonated body. Overall, this was fantastic, especially with its appearance and mouthfeel."
Nelson all over.
"A: Ample hop aromas of citrus and tropical fruit, coupled with white grape."
"Pours a very hazy orange with a white head. Smells of oranges, tropical fruits, and hops. Tastes of sweet papaya, mango, orange zest, grapefruit, hops, light malt, and other fruits. Medium creamy body with medium carbonation. Overall an incredible NEIPA."
"16oz can, served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy and cloudy golden yellow body with a slight orange hue. One finger white head, plenty of retention, bits of lacing on the opposite side of the glass as I drink. Smell is pineapple juice, grapefruit and citrus, a bit of sweet caramel though not too much, a little wheat germ. Flavour has a bit less of the pineapple juice quality but a more balanced light caramel with grapefruit and citrus hop aromatics, light resinous bitterness that isn't too distracting from the aforementioned hop aromatics. Not too sweet either. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, dangerously drinkable with a lighter-medium bitterness to it. Super tasty IPA."
"Just visited San Diego and picked up a 4 pack of this from their brewery. Drove it back today 9.5 hours back to Chico and cracked this one as a night cap. Smells phenomenal. Rain pouring out my window while I sip on this one with some nice background music. Also looks to be a Garage Project collab which is awesome. Super juicy, tons of citrus, but not overbearingly sweet. Poured completely hazy same color as a ripe persimmon. Glad I picked these up, cheers!"
"Received 2 cans from the great ScottO to try out. In that same package was a bottle of Citra from Kern. The Citra was a little over a week or 2 old, and in all honesty, I did not look at the relative age of the Blam Blam, but it blew Citra out of the water hands down. A brighter pour, great citrus nose, which is echoed in the flavor. A little bitter on the end, but it is an IPA. Fantastic beer."
"16 oz can, purchased a few hours ago from the source in Beacon, NY....11/6/18 caning date."
Decanted from a 32 oz crowler into a conical pint glass; canned on 07/14/2018.
"Drank on tap at Hudson Valley Brewery, Beacon, NY"
"Wow! Like a Ninja Turtle on DMT, this one is unique! Sour and hoppy all together! It's like a SI model moonlighting as your uber driver - I like that!"
"Nice sour IPA looks that leaves good spotty lacing, but the star of the show is the nose: smells of tangerine, grapefruit, peppery spices, tea leaf, orange peel, chamomile, toasted grains, yeast, floral notes and light cinnamon and/or potpourri that somehow works as a nice sour IPA. I’m not normally a fan of intense spices nor the extra floral notes mixed with potpourri like chamomile, but this works with the sour/tart IPA citrus notes. Crazy combo that somehow works well."
"Another winner from Kane, NJ's best brewery IMO. Head High is a wonderful beer and this continues that. So juicy with citrus notes while also being well balanced and smooth. Excellent beer."
"Thanks to The Terminator, SadMachine, for this 500ML bottle. "
Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle
Recently offered in 16.9 oz bottles. WHOO HOO! Poured into Aslin Teku glass.
"Peach golden color with a thick white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Notes of fresh squeezed lemon and lime, citrus zest, grapefruit, tangerine, touch of black peppercorn and a candied herbal sweetness. Carbonation seems spot on refreshing, crushable, light medium body, slightly dry and soft on the palate. This is a fantastic, zippy and even slightly tart, juicy, hop bomb of an IPA. Blew me away."
L: Hazy and cloudy peach/golden orange body replete with a fluffy white head and ample lacing
"Not much smell, but the look is bar none awesome. Nice lace on the glass, just the right head and a deep rich amber. However, I drink beer for the taste not the look. Yes taste is a 4 and I would like to try this on draft, but it could use a little more malt backbone."
Only downside: available only in NM and CO
"Nice copper color beer. Not much head but good lacing. Better hop aroma. And good hoppy taste. Mouthfeel is a good balance of hops that’s not too bitter. Overall it’s a very good IPA and I’m glad I got a 4 pack to take home, based on BA ratings. Canned 09/06/18"
1 pint can:
"I picked up a four pack of tall boys for a camping trip to Guadalupe Mountains national park earlier this week. This is a big, aggressive brew with high bitterness and a heavy citrus and herbal hop lean. The finish is juicy and puckers the lips a bit. I would definitely take this camping again if given the chance."
"Elevated is a beautiful looking beer. The brightly polished copper color is familiar and inviting, and the foamy eggshell white pillow above is comforting. The patches and rings of lace are the impressive marks of a professional."
"The beer to bring back from a trip to northern New Mexico. I pour most of the 16 oz can into a chilled tall mug, see a nice yellow-orange body with enough head to keep track of the sips. Hoppy, of course, strongly so. I detect lemon, grass and a bit of sweetness at the end. The taste and bitterness linger. Should be the first beer of a session before you move on to lesser brews, just make the four pack last."
"August 19th, 2015 - Cumbre's Get Elevated IPA is a solidly median IPA, neither good nor bad, but with a hop profile that is boring on its own but fits a meal very nicely. The aroma is generically hoppy and reminds me of old school pale ales, neither sweet nor grapefruity. The flavor is flattish but the palate is fine. Nice and buoyant, it has a sharp hop profile that lasts a long way through the aftertaste, but is both a little direct and metallic."
"Can at Brixens, Albuquerque, NM"
"Pours clear copper with a medium white head. Aroma brings out fresh piney hop character and a dry biscuity malt backing. Flavor is clean, with tons of piney hops, citrus, and biscuity malt. Piney and dry, with a wonderfully oily palate. Sharp dry and bitter finish."
"32oz crowler, filled on 8.31.18, poured into a Corridor Bicycle pint glass."
"Crowler from the brewery, poured into a snifter. This checks all the boxes for a NE IPA. Low bitterness, creamy mouthfeel, orange yellow color. Nose and taste are orange, and apricot candy with maybe a little bit of tart fruit at the end."
"Sample from the brewery. This beer's soft, opaque, matte orange color screams NEIPA, while a cloudlike head that just won't quit gives Cosmic Juice Box appearance points lacking from many of its less accomplished peers. Meanwhile, deep orange notes, whispers of apricot, prominent pine, lemon candy, and waves of passion fruit make this one worth an extra sniff or two. Some solvent-y alcohol also shows up as the drink warms in the glass. Although full-bodied, Corridor has made an IPA with balance and bitterness, which enhances its drinkability. Lots of citrus, a bit of resin, toasted sourdough, and a semi-dry finish distinguish the flavor. Well executed and extremely likeable."
"Crowler from a friend. I thought this was super nice. The aroma is stellar, huge dry hop fruity ness, very juicy. The body is on the heavier side, a touch sweet for my taste, but nice hop flavor. Solid effort"
"Tasted in a snifter from draft at Corridor Brewery & Provisions on December 8, 2017. Thick hazy IPA brewed with Citra, Mosaic, and double dry hopped with tons of Galaxy. Recommended."
Crowler filled 9/23/17; drank 9/24/17 @ the Yarchives. 
"Poured from a crowler less than a day old off the draft line. The appearance is muddled orange, like an unfiltered mango or peach juice. Made with galaxy, citra, and mosaic hops, but really a showcase for the galaxy--pineapple, passion fruit, and mango on the nose, tangerine added on the palate. A bit of bittering hop character throughout the experience, so not a total juice bomb, but it's better off for that added complexity."
"Another home run from Corridor! It has their expected soft, pillowy mouth feel without feeling un-carbed. Very juicy, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors exploding out of the glass."
Hazy opaque orange with a thin layer of foam and spotty lace. 
Canned 10/29/18. It’s getting more difficult to discern all of these NEIPAs from one another. They’re all amazingly delicious. But massive hop character can obscure flavor so they all end up tasting like super juicy tropical fruit.
Canned two weeks ago.
"16 oz. can. Hazy orange. Smells of orange and, since I just read the description and it says peach, I smell peach juice. The vaguest hint of toasted malt that I remember from the regular version. Tastes of orange and that same sweet peach flavor. Both flavors push well into the back end, though some toasted malt and a slight grapefruit bitterness come through. Medium body with low carbonation. I remember the regular version being quite different from other Trillium IPAs. This is not different, though complaining would be unfair, as it is still very good."
"Dated 5/14/18 on the bottom of the can, 9 days since brewing."
Lovely.
"Pours a cloudy yellow gold with thick head and lacing. Nose is very sweet, citrus, malt, hops, floral. Flavors match the nose, very nice peach notes with some orange, floral jumping in with a malt finish. Slight bitterness also, this is a fantastic IPA, very balanced and loaded with flavor, ultra smooth."
"Nice resinous bite, good grapefruit and caramel with a bit of biscuit. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation, nice resinous and leafy bite on the backend. Another solid IPA from Fat Head's."
"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a stemless wine glass. Lovely appearance: slightly hazy, light amber in color, three-finger white head, lots of pretty lacing. Big blast of hoppy aroma upon opening the bottle. Poured cold, the hops dominated the aroma and flavor profiles. Lots of dank, juicy pine and citrus, lots of zesty and resiny bitterness. Once it starts to warm a bit, the balance becomes apparent. Good malt structure that provides a little sweetness while allowing the hops to shine. Clean finish, well-hidden ABV. Great beer with food, too."
Found at a reputable beer store in Cleveland but should have checked the date. This was from early October so I don't feel this was the best. Overall pretty okay. Definitely need to try one of these fresh.
On draft in pint glass. darker color than expected. head lasted a while. smell is straight bitter hops. Taste is NE style IPA without any citrus. Great beer that i will watch for in future
"This one was bottled 10/4, so it's about six weeks old."
Drinking on tap at the facility right now. Beautiful pour with a great head. Great smell. Mosaic hop bomb! If this was from New England it would be top 250. Easily.
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Aroma is sweet and fruity with dextrin malt notes and slightly sweaty and dank hops. Taste has sweet vanilla notes and juicy hops with medium bitterness."
Pours hazy orange with a pillowy head.
16 oz. can dated 4/28/18 purchased at brewery and poured into Belgian ale glass.
"Pours a very dense, hazy orange juice color. I have never seen a beer with this lever of haze / turbidity. It seems to glow. Nose is very, very faint grapefruit. Very flavorful for 6.6% abv. Lots of citrus flavors here - grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, subtle peach and mango. Excellent carbonation lens to a creamy mouth feel. Overall this beer is a very flavorful IPA, could easily drink a few of these in one session, but for $20 a 4-pack this is a bit on the expensive side."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the brewery on 10/7/17. Review copied from notes. Poured into an 8oz glass, Mosaic Punch is a turbid orange color with a fluffy white head. Juicy tropical hop aromas of pineapple and grapefruit. Beautifully complex hop profile, the mosaic hop truly proves its name by giving up notes of peach, mango and orange. Slightly dry finish. What a delightful beer. Kane just keeps getting better and better."
"I had this on draught at a restaurant. 16 oz. pour served in a shaker glass. It pours a turbid, brown-gold color with a finger of fluffy, bright white head and lacing that coated the glass for the entire pour. It's a tropical fruit bomb with fragrant mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, pine needles, and light floral hops. The taste is out of this world! It opens with lemon peel and sweet pineapple, mango, and a hint of vanilla, then closes with dank Mosaic, Citra, and Galaxy hops, and lightly-astringent pepper. Every flavor is unique but they blend seamlessly. The mouth feel is equally impressive: silky and creamy with pleasant carbonation. The 6.6% ABV seems just right: it provides substance without being distracting. Overall, this ale is a tour de force. It's hard to imagine how to improve it."
Bright hazy yellow. A little bit of head lingers throughout. Huge nose on this. Massive tropical fruit. Taste follows suit. Berries in there as well. A bit of bitterness. Feel is right where it should be. A nice chew. My only complaint is that this beer just completely falls off on the back end. I guess that could be seen as a good thing. Makes you go back for more. But I just wish it had a bit more on the finish to round it out a bit better. But this is really great stuff.
Pours hazy golden. Orange and tangerine on the nose. It's got good creamy galaxy citrus character with only a little bit of the bite that comes from raw vegetal galaxy.
"Great color, lovely head. Smells like sweet, creamy Galaxy. Flavor hits the same notes with smooth, fluffy layers of Galaxy; sweet citrus, a little grapefruit, and something I'd describe as a vanilla biscuit/cookie. This beer is a thing of beauty."
"Typical hazy Trillium body. A hint more golden in hue. Smell is melon, tropical fruit, and citrus. Tropical fruit forward flavor with passion fruit and mango. Backing bitterness for balance. Little astringent on the finish."
L - goddamn they are really ripping through these things since starting the Permutation series. Can crack revealed the most appetizing head layer I've seen in some time. Juicy and frothy and full. Galaxy-tinted pineapple haze. 
"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Canton, MA"
"This IPA has a nutty start w a crisper finish than a lot of IPAs, also it gets me drunk so yeah...drink up princess!"
"Golden, and cloudy in a crisp sort of way. Moderately carbonated, with two fingers of off-white head. "
"The feel and look of this one are world class. Juicy, watery, round mouthfeel and transitions from cloudy gold to glassy gold in the mug. Taste is simple IPA but very well done orange peel and lemon with some malt background. A+ stuff from Alpine. BTW, Alpine is a nice hilly community in San Diego for those that don't know. I'm impressed that that small community that has so few stores and looks like the Wild West with one old school Western street can produce this!"
Loved it when I first had it but the last few times I just felt it was boring. Surely a classic but not keeping my interest. 
"pours with a yellow/golden color; the smell is very citrusy, hops and pine. Taste is wonderful balance of the hops, citrus (grapefruit; tropical fruit); some malts and a bit of hops bitterness at the end. The feel is crisp and clean. Awesome beer."
"Pours a hazed copper color with a compact, frothy cap. Simcoe fruitiness mingles with cookie dough malts in the nose. Citrusy, peach, melon hops abound in the taste. A solid, clean pale malt ballast keeps things in check. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. Tons of floral, fruity hops in the everlasting finish."
Clean citrusy and piney amber ipa. This west coast ale has a certain bitterness. It's crisp and drinkable but the mouthfeel could be improved. Some herbal notes. I was hoping for something a bit more complex
"5 oz pour at Cleveland Fat Head’s. Clear pale amber pour with white head. Aroma is distinctly piney, grapefruit, citrus with caramel notes - smells very inviting - screams drink me. Taste is hoppy pine, pineapple and citrus bitter sweetness; bitterness carries the day - but so well balanced with the sweet malt. Medium full mouthfeel - finishes with a delicious lingering happiness. A beer that I could drink every day and be perfectly happy."
"Golden hued body with a fine foamy head; bits of lacing clinging to the glass. Spicy, herbal and pine aroma. Crystal malt base (it seems like) with a spicy, peppery hop taste; very bitter. Medium body; dry and prickly on the palate."
"Today is the occasion of New Fat Rusty Head Rail Sunday (Week 714) & while we just began receiving distro of Fat Head's beers, we do not get the full oeuvre as yet. This will be my last from them for today, but it will be a glorious exit! This is not only one of their flagships but also one of my faves, both from them & in general. "
"My first from Fat Heads, so I went on their website. A successful family business 25 years old and now full of friends and admirers as customers. So who am I to pan their cash cow? I won't."
"The first sip and smell are a little off, but it gets great."
"And old school DIPA, juicy and bitter. With a clean malt bill, and at almost 8% it’s extremely drinkable. Citrus and pine dominate with hop bitterness on the finish. Awesome!"
"Again, another brewery JUST coming to this god forsaken land of Western New York. So late to the game, but now that it’s here...wow! Fresh growler tap, poured chilled aggressively to a tulip glass. In hindsight, a moderate to slow pour is in order, as this has some lively carbonation. Huge white foamy head that dissipates to a bubbling hot tub sizzle. Nose is immensely fragrant citrus and pine, sensed easily from two feet away. Clear amber, with tons of carbonation deep from the bottom...reminds me of PtE’s bubble pattern. Pause for Pliny respect...oh, I’d have to drive to Philadelphia to get another one...damn you Russian River with your spartan distro! First sips are all juicy, piney, grassy, hoppy bright tones. Totally balanced by a semisweet malt back end, that is dark like a hoarhound. Mouthfeel is just above thin, but stays full with a lingering hoppiness. Alcohol is in the above average range, but the crispness and flavor put it in the crushable range. I’ve seen reviews that this will fade fast, but one doesn’t expect a juicy IPA to live long, right? I could see this as a summer staple while I bide time for stout season!"
"Pours golden clear, appropriate foamy head. Aroma is faint - dank and hoppy. Very hoppy flavor - plenty of bitterness, piney hops. Carbonation is on point. I remember this beer a bit bolder: that being said, this beer is 2 months old. I will revisit with a fresher beer in the future. Several years ago, before the explosion of breweries, this was my go to beer. My palate may have shifted to the New England style of IPA.. This still a great west coast IPA."
On-draught @ Weldwerks.
Appearance: Arrives with a golden color verging on orange; the cap is a finger high and leaves some shards behind
Something very wrong. Like an IPA with toothpaste.
One of the bests I’ve had.
"Right after the can opening, you can smell a nice tropical smell waving to your nostrils from afar."
Love rpm. Hope they decide to bottle for home consumption
"A tasty and enjoyable IPA. One of my favorites. Look is lighter than many IPA's. Wish it was available in more locations, like grocery stores in 6 pack 1/2 rack and cases."
L: Pours a clear golden orange with a small white head and a few fingers of sticky lacing around the glass.
"On tap. Poured a clear, golden-yellow color with a small, white head of bubbly foam. It smelled of grapefruit, pineapple, mango and caramel. Nice tropical fruit taste with a great bitter bite."
Another beer on my radar found during my Portland trip.
"Aroma and taste are both bursting with huge citrus flavors--sweet oranges, clementines are the first to draw blood out of the glass, with some light bittering grapefruit that quickly follows suit. The brighter flavors are well-balanced by a supporting base of resinous pine, and some light herbaceous peppery complements."
Poured from the can into a tulip.
"On tap at Prohibition Pig brewpub, Waterbury, Vermont. This was poured into a half pint glass, the brewpub normally pours it in. The appearance was a hazy blurry yellow color with a slim white little head that dissipated and left no lacing. The smell started off with a sweet citrus and sweet grassy blend leading into subtle crisp tropical fruits and underscored by just a little bit of bitter pine. The taste had a moderate amount of sweetness with some light bitterness of the pine carrying itself back into the balance of it all. A light citrus aftertaste runs into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionable crispness carrying itself along my tongue. Overall, this was a very nice AIPA that I would have again."
"On tap at Haymaker, NYC, had the classic New England IPA looks with a lovely gold hazy hue, but the head was pretty small from the tap pour."
"Look: A light, dull orange color. "
In a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 
Had out of a pint glass at a bar.
On-draught @ The Ginger Man NYC.
"L - light orange, opaque, lots of lacing"
"First had this on tap at Alpine Beerco and Restaurant – Alpine, CA"
This is a solid from Beachwood- it tastes much better and fuller than than Tongue Tickles which was thinner in taste. This beer competes with the best of them and it is a grab from the shelf when you see it beer.
A - Pours a clear golden color with a one inch head.
"A: Hoppy aromas of danky, white grape mixed with berries, coupled with a light cracker malt sweetness. "
On tap at Cellarmaker
"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, yellow session. Mostly grassy and dank, herbal with a medium bitterness. Body is quite light and dry."
"i have always said that you could dump a boatload of nelson hops into a glass of urine and it would smell and taste delicious, so its always a little weird critically judging nelson beers. i love the hop so much that i favor almost any beer that uses it. this is one of the best examples of it, pure and true, unmolested by other hops, too much grain or alcohol, or time in a bottle. fresh as can be at the taproom, it has a pale yellow milky unfiltered east coast look to it under an inch of shaving cream thick white head. all nelson in the nose, pineapple from the can, white peaches, lemon meringue, and all the other aromatic elements this hop brings to the part so consistently. the flavor here is more like a pale than an ipa, not a lot of bitterness happening here at all. a nice juicy fresh hop flavor for certain, but it trails off a little at the end, primarily late kettle, whirlpool, and dry hopped i would imagine. some fruity notes, white grape, tangerine, pineapple in the taste, and a nice wheaty or oaty rich structured but nice and dry grain base for it. if you want to know what nelson hops do, this is a perfect example of it. i could have drank ten of these happily..."
"On-tap at Alvarado Street Brewery, Monterey, CA"
"From a growler into a high ball glass. Hotel life. Pours golden, hazy and with light carbonation. Light head. Sticky trails of lacing. 4.25"
Very nice nelson character
My favorite Trillium beer (so far) with hazy look and smooth finish. Tough to find it though as I'm not sure if this was limited.
"Excellent New England juicy IPA. My only mistake was having double dry hopped Summer Street before this base model. While DDH Summer Street is extraordinary, this is a solid, enjoyable beer from it's hazy golden color, to its light and satisfying series of flavor stages."
"Dated 5/8/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing."
12 oz bottle from a six pack purchased at the LCBO; bottled Aug 8 2018 and served slightly chilled.
"355 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. Purchase came out to $3 CDn per bottle, but it's not often that we get SoCal IPA's available in this neck of the woods."
I don’t love it for some reason
"Like this a lot, have tried several Ballast Point beers, like them all, this is my favorite. Citrus in nose & taste, good mouth feel, expensive so I pick it up when on sale."
"My FAVORITE IPA. The blend of Mosaic, Warrior, Columbus and Amarillo hops just does it for me...and maybe the fact that Beachwood is local for me, I’ll get this 16oz can/4-pak at my local bottle shop when it’s just a few days old!"
"Poured from the can into a shaker pint glass, boo hiss... canned September 24 2018."
This is an exceptional beer. Every time I find it I only wonder why I didn't get more.
Thanks Damon.
Canned on 5/7; consumed on 5/26 - poured from a tall boy into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. 
"Clean golden color. Aroma has sweet honey and pollen notes, quite floral hop profile. Taste has a sweet malty backbone with floral hops and medium bitterness on the finish. Medium body, crisp carbonation."
"Pours a clear goden yellow with soapy, fine foam."
From a pint can.
Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass
An excellent IPA.
3-16
"16oz can from a four pack that cost $13.49. Aroma is heavy Mosaic, berries and some sweetness. Flavor is more Mosaic, berries, a nice malt backbone, some bitterness, a great West Coast IPA."
"Straight pour from a 16oz can to a tall, narrow pint (Green Cheek nucleated flute). This was canned on January 31, 19 days before the time of consumption, according to a black ink canning date on the underside of the can (""CANNED ON 01/31/18""). Refrigerated consistently. "
"Beautiful looking beer! Crystal clear straw yellow pour with a huge pillowy eggshell head. Had to give the look a 4.5 cuz it’s that pristine! Nose is piney. Full of sap, must and resin. Slight notes of grapefruit zest. Taste is of sticky pine sap, pine needles, light floral and crisp grapefruit. Some grainyness shows through as well. Medium body to slightly thin. Nicely coats my tulip with a thin oily film as well as the teeth ;) If I was ever questioning my love for “west coast” IPAs which I wasn’t this beer reaffirmed the beauty of a brilliant pine bomb!"
L - let's see how Sand City tackles single hops... pours a simultaneously light and dark orange. Vague haze. Minimal head. 
"Pours a hazy golden color with brown hues, a two inch, very well retained fluffy white head that left loads of lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, melon, a hint of pepper and citrus pith. Medium to Full bodied, smooth and slightly chewy mouth feel, well carbonated, slightly bitter and dry finish"
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (11 days old). Appearance is a fairly hazy orange brown with two finger thick head and decent retention. Smell is earthy hops, blueberry, spice (pepper), grapefruit, hay and a hint of resin and pineapple."
"Medium-pale gold body, faintly hazed; tall head of white foam left lots of messy lace behind... Aroma and flavor impressions of citrus, melon, grapefruit and pineapple... Moderately sweet, mildly bitter, amply carbonated... Soft and smooth, medium-light and fluffy body... Great showcase for Mosaic hops... 6/2/17 release date..."
"amber blood orange haze frothy white head. Strong citrus, mango, candied peach and honey on the nose. Resiny juice slightly malty light carbonation, melon and tropical fruit with a bitter smooth finish."
"Fresh draft at the brewery. Pours like a NE style IPA should...thick and totally hazy. The color is a weak orange coupled with yellow. World class head volume, lacing and retention."
"elite level east coast ipa, as juicy and bright as any of the beers in here, insanely drinkable, and not just hazy to be hazy, the starchy grain base is awesome, almost creamy in texture, and there is so much hop character here, some residuals in suspension make a lot of sense. its still relatively low bitterness, although there is some balance to it, heavily dry hopped for sure though, so juicy and fresh squeezed tasting, navel oranges and meyer lemons and even green grape in the nose, a little more zesty lime and lemongrass character in the flavor, a cool mix of hop varietals i would think, but its hard to place specifically here, as its all so well integrated and unified and all of that, not separate or out of step at all. a really smooth feel, a little acidic oddly enough almost like actual orange juice, these guys are doing great stuff with the malts underneath the hops in these beers, this one seems to have some wheat structure too, but its also really dry, not quite biscuity but not one dimensional either, perfect for the hops. this has seemingly become one of their more popular beers, and rightfully so. downright delicious new school ipa right here!"
"First offering from The Fermentory...hopefully not my last. Aroma is off the charts floral! Taste is citrusy/fruity. Overall one of the best IPAs from the South. Put it up with Parish, Southern Prohibition, Civil, Heist, and Bearded Iris."
"Poured from a growler into a tulip glass (3 days old). Appearance is yellow brown in color and very opaque (1/2 finger thick head). Smell hits you with a sweet pineapple/honey/bubblegum flavor, which I assume is generated from their yeast, and citrus hop notes. Excellent, tons of floral hops."
A really solid NEIPA.
Growler obtained from Edmunds Oast Exchange.
"Honestly, have had all sorts of IPAs from all the big boys up north. This is easily one of my favorite."
Pint can dated 10/26/18 poured into a tulip at 46F
16 oz can into IPA glass. Dated 10/4/18.
One of the best NEIPAs I’ve yet to have. Hazy orange with a dank smell and taste of papaya mango grapefruit guava. Great beer.
"Very nice beer, had it at the same session I was having a Treehouse Julius and preferred it to that. Smoother and more complex. That said, I wouldn't drive an hour to get it and stand in line for another 30 minutes, like the Julius experience. But if it was available with reasonable effort I'd definitely be keeping it in the rotation."
"Nice bright, hazy orange color, good head and retention."
Perfect beer. Can’t say I’ve had a better one. The price is awesome too!!! NEIPA at its best.
"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery two days ago. Served in an imperial pint pub glass."
"Wow this is a superemely well balanced and delicate juicy IPA. Plenty of tangerine orange, grapefruit, lemon, peach, some nice piney and green notes that bring a mellow bitterness and bready malts dancing in the background. Excellent mouthfeel light/medium bodied with some slightly creamy texture."
"Growler. Poured very hazy. Aroma was pretty magnificent. They added a really neat assortment of hops in here. I love the Nelson and its nuanced aromatics. Its very fruity and tropical but there is also a good dose of pine and greens. I enjoyed the flavor a bit less than the nose but both were quite delectable. The flavor was more straightforward and slightly less intricate. Still, the combination of fruity and green was pretty excellent. Slightly earthy hop finish which I liked. Had more body than I was expecting. Creamy feel. Another stud."
Growler from the source.
At the source. Tastes like 2009.
"An absolutely lovely IPA in the style of Size 7 or Surly Furious, Town Hall's Masala Mama has inspired many imitators, but few can compare with the balance, delightful aroma and subtle bitter taste of the original."
Long time want - thank you Chris P!
"Pretty average IPA, moderate bitterness, sticky sweetness, fairly malt forward."
"Was super excited to try this given the high rating, but really disappointed when the beer hit my tastebuds. Had it at the tap room, very avg IPA"
This beer smells great with a very natural fragrant peach. Tastes like it smells but the best part is that the peach is not overpowering and let's the original Jai Alai flavor come through. It only adds to an already great beer. I never grew tired of drinking it and in fact had two which is rare for a fruit adjunct beer.
Off the chain. Jai Alai made sexy time with a peach and this was their baby. God bless the parents.
"Drank from a 750 ml growler purchased at Steady Habit Brewing Company, Haddam, CT"
"Big time citrus nose in this one. Sustained white head. Taste is full of citrus notes but not too over the top as some citra-hopped beers can be. Not abrasive. It has a nice soft malty base to it, maybe that's why. My kind of IPA. Mild but lasting bitterness in the end."
"Really smooth and drinkable for a double IPA, really liked it."
"L: Hazy, a little bit gold, a little bit orangish. Nice white head that leaves a speckled lacing on the glass. "
"Aslin can hit home runs with their IPAs, but also has their share of so-so ones (for the price). This is a home run. Huge powdered sugar on the nose along with creamsicle and some vanilla. That same powdered sugar is in the flavor, but without the sweetness. Milky/creamy fruit, that creamsicle, and again that vanilla. Tastes a little bigger than 6.5%. Nice long finish with lingering fruity hops, this has enough bitterness that it doesn't just disappear like some NEIPAs. Maybe a little overpriced, but actually less overpriced than many of Aslin's beers. Great."
"Looks great - a hazy golden yellow with an off-white head and nice lacing. Smells like an orange creamsicle. Flavor-wise the vanilla is too strong, overpowering the oranges and hops. Slightly cloying which is not a good thing especially at just 6.5% abv. The slightly harsh mouthfeel has moderate carbonation. On the bright side, this might be the first IPA my wife enjoyed more than I did - she was a fan of the vanilla."
"Poured a light yellow-gold body with minimal head and no lace. The lactic/lupalin aspect dominates the aroma. Smooth, fuller body with a milky sweetness that I can’t quite pinpoint. Some hoppy dryness on finish with an earthy bitterness for some balance."
L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had an orange-amber color and a thick and cloudy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Solid lacing.
super orange beer with tiny little bubbles at the top. Almost no real head retention at all. 
"L: Gold, transparent. Gorgeous head with nice lacing. Good retention."
Bottle dated 10/11/18. CBF pint.
12oz Stubby
This is a good Fresh Hop ale! Great dank taste and awesome hoppiness. Nice to sip for a long time. Looking to get a four pack toon as it is out on the shelf at present.
8 days old.
Bottled 10/09. Received in trade with an Ohioan. 
12oz bottle purchased as a single for $2.50. Stamped born on date of 10/09/2017.
"Yakima Fresh is a bright and clear golden yellow with a dense and foamy bone white head. Streams of bubbles flow from bottom to top, and rings form on the sides of the glass."
"Description: Golden, honey color and clear with only a small amount of head. Smell is dank, tropical fruit (mango) and hoppy; pretty well balanced. Taste is similar but with floral notes as well. Feels sort of like an East Coast IPA with a danker, more bitter finish. Feel is light to medium body and medium to high carbonation."
"Pours a hazed gold with 2+ fingers of whippy cream colored head. Clears a bit, very good lacing & head retention"
Slightly hazy golden color with a thick head. 
A home run
"Pale gold, really soapy enduring head, lively carbonation. Nose is pretty delicate with some bright, floral / citrus hop notes and some cracker malt. Taste has a light-to-medium hop resin underscored by some tangerine, nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes clean & bitter. Relies pretty have on Citra hops but well done regardless"
"Pours a bright yellow color with a quick, fizzy white head leaving slippery lacing."
"This is a beer that intends to showcase the distinnct aromas of the Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. Indeed the beer has a nice citrusy and grassy aroma and taste to it, supported by some solid and tasty malts. Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours hazy, orangeish yellow. Thick, foamy, tall white head that Fades slowly to a long lasting rocky head with good lacing."
Pours a super hazy/ cloudy light mango-color. 1 finger of fluffy head with amazing retention and lacing.
"650ml bottle, freshly packaged, purchased at the brewery, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku glass. Enjoyed on 1.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal."
"Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of citrus, pineapple, toasted caramel and hints of resin. Bitter and hoppy bite with a sweet caramel backbone and citrus finish."
"Picked-up up a four-pack of cans at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for $20. Have had a few brews from these guys before. Good brew, but very dank, w/ pine/grass, would not buy again at this price point."
Canned 4 weeks ago.
"L: opaque, matte honey lemon "
Canned 23 days ago.
"On tap at the brewery. Hazy orange. Smells of tangerine and some pale malt. Tastes of orange and then bitter pith. Aggressive bitter pith that kinda ruins it. I'm all about bitterness, but this tastes funny. Medium body. Not Trillium's best."
16oz can poured into a pint glass shows an orange juice colored body and briefly floats a fluffy 1/4in yellowish foam that disippates to an edge hugging ring with a whispy island.
Can. Hazy sunset golden orange. White head with lace. This is first brewing project beer that I haven’t really enjoyed. It’s good beer but not up to BP standards for me. 
Very hazy orange juice colored beer with a off white/very light orange color. 
L_Hazy glowing tan/yellow
"Look: Full on Haze, deep murky golden brown. One and half fingers off fluffy white head. This looks the part. "
"If you like murky IPA, then this one fits the bill. OJ in a glass; full on haze; myriad lacing. The nose is insane with citrus aromatics, belied by underlying hints of mango, peach, and orange sherbet. Taste follows but isn't as pronounced as the smell, which isn't a bad thing, it's just not quite as impactful as the nose. Is it delicious? F*ck, yes! Citra hops are on point in this one. The finish is nice and creamy; my only gripe would be that it's not as chewy as I would prefer. All that said, this is an incredible beer worth seeking. I almost feel compelled to give the smell a 5.0, but I'll go with my initial reaction. Thanks, Micah!!!"
"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pint can on February 3, 2018. Look is hazy orange gold thick white head and sticky lacing. Smell and taste is juicy citrus fruit and a hint of sweet malt. Feel is creamy and smooth."
"Appearance: light yellow, totally hazy-opaque, like a hybrid between yeast slurry and lupulin. The head is an off-white 1/8 finger of fine bubbles."
"16 oz can, canned on 3/22/18. Pours very murky light yellow with a small creamy white head that quickly goes to a thin film that laces the glass."
A growler purchased at the brewery on 09/23/17 poured in a Storm Peak 'Dogfish Head style' IPA glass. 
absolutely perfect hazy ny style ipa. one of the best beers i've ever had.
"On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY."
"LUV the Soup series and Galaxy doesn't disappoint, great NE IPA look, nice smell w citrus notes and great taste and feel."
Undated tall can
"Pours a hazy golden color with a one inch, fluffy white head that left a little lacing. Smells of citrus and tropical fruits. Tastes of pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon, tangerine, pine and a hint of pepper. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, mild bitterness, smooth mouth feel with just a minimal amount of dryness."
Incredible single hop (galaxy) NE haze IPA! They absolutely nailed this one!
Smells like nug after a few weeks!
"Medium-pale gold body, hazed to opacity, with a white head a couple of fingers high that left lace lines behind... Impressions of grapefruit, white wine grapes, and pale melon on the nose and tongue... Bright and light, but rounded with an earthier edge to keep it grounded... Mildly sweet, mildly bitter, creamy smooth, and easy-drinking... 10/1/17 release..."
"Had on tap at the brewery last weekend, but this review is from a can: pours cloudy yellow gold color with a 1-2 finger thick white head that's full of tiny bubbles, fading very slowly and leaving excellent foamy spider web lacing and rings as it went down. The lacing really sticks to the glass and is another masterpiece looking NE style IPA by Sand City, who have these looks nailed down."
Had this beer on draft at the Brew Cafe.
This is a very nice and hoppy IPA with just about enough fruitiness to make it complex and refreshing. Smooth mouthfeel and a nice and long bitterness.
"Enjoyed at the 2016 Copenhagen Beer Festival in Boston, MA. Reviewed from notes."
Poured from tap at the Brew Cafe into a pint glass.
"SUPER cloudy and golden/straw color, peachy whit head. Smell is mango and maybe a hint of pineapple, definitely ripe fruit. Sharp bubble up front followed by a smooth, creamy, luxurious texture. Taste is mango and juicy, a little bubblegum on the back, some rind bitterness. The bitterness gets sharper as you work your way through, it started out tasting better than it does at the end."
"L - oh man, all I did was crack the can it it looks like liquid mangos. Can't wait to pour... wtf this is the yellowist I've ever seen beer! It looks like straight puréed mangos! Incredible! An absolute brick of solid milky hazy yellow. Sticky lacing dissipates quickly but desperately grabs at the sides of the glass. "
Pours a very cloudy yellow. Grapefruit Mango juice. Minimal head and lacing. 
"16oz can poured into a teku glass. Pours a smoothie-like yellow-orange. Nose is strongly mango, with a faint underripe mango, almost chemical, background on the nose. The palate is at first, somewhat Julius-like: lots of tropical fruit (predominantly mango) resting in a smoothie-like mouthfeel. The backend of the palate (for this batch particularly) has been causing controversy, with this release having been dubbed ""MagoTagoGate"". There's a strong, chemical burn, like a way-underripe mango on steroids. This Campden-tablet like flavor mars what would otherwise be an extraordinary beer. So much so, in fact, that Tired Hands offered a refund on this batch (the cost of the can + 50c). Given that, and given that Paperhouse - the release of MagoTago aimed at correcting this - was a homerun, I don't feel I can adequately review this beer based on having tried an off iteration. As such, I will be reviewing this similarly to Paperhouse, to be more consistent with the flavor that has represented the majority of this beer's existence."
"Pours a opaque yellow with a thin white head that faded quickly leaving some fine lacing. Aroma of citrus, passion fruit. Taste is passion fruit, lemon, lemon grass. Wheat grain bill is evident. Not really bitter at all more tart. Light body. Clean finish. Crisp and refreshing. Would be great on a hot summer day."
"Pours opaque golden yellow. Smells of stone fruit, yeast, and malt. Tastes intensely of bitter fruit and hops. Feel is thick and chewy with minimal booziness. Overall: not my favorite from Tired Hands, but pretty darn good. Light and refreshing compared to a lot of tired hands' beers."
"Golden straw color, hazy, small white head, great lacing. Grassy, herbal, passionfruit nose. Notes of passionfruit juice, lemongrass, lemon and herbs. Lighter side if medium, crisp and crushable. Solid and fruit forward IPA."
Very hazy gray-hued yellow with a thin bright white head that leaves heavy lacing. 
"Lovely hazy yellow with a nice head. Aroma is insanely tropical, with fruit being very prominent. The flavor profiles reflects very faithfully the nose and is as complex as any IPA I've had from Tired Hands. Very chewable."
8 oz. pour on tap at the Fermentaria.
"Great inbetween NE/West Coast style here. Really ripe fruits with a good pine/citrus rind backbone. On the very clean side with a sharp bite on the finish. I do prefer a bit more mouthfeel, but a good clean beer at the end of the day."
16 oz can into 7 oz cup 
Opaque orange-yellow with a large white froth that persists as a thin blanket and clings in a coral-like fuzzy wall.
"Can* dated 8/1/17 into pint glass. Pours a cloudy gold-orange with a thin off-white head. Initial impression is citrus/grapefruit, hints of pine, and a sweet malt backbone. Mouthfeel is mediuml as is carbonation. Finish is slightly sweet and tart. Quite enjoyable."
16 oz can dated 6/14/18 and purchased at brewery. Poured into Belgian ale glass.
"L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had a bright, golden yellow color and a slightly hazy consistency. There was a small amount of foamy head that quickly dissipated. Pretty good lacing."
16 OZ can
"Home is a bright and light American IPA from Ocelot Brewing. I do like that it has details about the ingredients used right there on the label, even though I don't have enough knowledge to judge them individually."
The beer pours a nice white and foamy head that dissipate pretty quickly. The beer itself is a nice clear pale gold color that looks pretty nice. It has a nice golden metallic hue to it.
Love the contrast of the bright white head and the opaque orange yellow beer.
"Cloudy peach colour, with little carbonation and a finger of off white head. "
12oz. capped bottle into Night Shift stemware. 
"Pours golden. Smells of tropical fruits and pine. the taste is amazing balance of the tropical fruits (lemon, tangerine) and some hops. I agree that this tastes like an IPA. The feel is refreshing, clean and crisp as is Alpine's style."
"Advertised as a pale, I get how one can get it confused with an IPA. Intensely hopped it has aromas of chive and cannabis mostly. The resinous herbal character can also be found in the taste with a nice malt backbone. The carbonation is moderate and permits a full drinkability. "
"Holy shit, 69 IBUs in a 5.3% ale?? Now that's a session IPA. Pure Hoppiness was so damn amazing, I had to try this one too, although I rarely bother with light beers. I usually am not a fan of such nonsense."
12 oz. bottle poured into willibecher. 
Active brew. Very bubbly. Hard to tell if its the bubbles or there is a haziness. Smooth white head terrific lacing. 
"Smells tropical, pineapple mostly with some sweetness on the nose. Grapefruit pith and pine bitterness after slight initial sweetness. The slightly astringent bitterness sticks with you. This beer reads out more like an IPA to me with less attention to the malt. Well put together feel like a prickly IPA."
"Hoppy Birthday pours a light, clean amber color - carbonation is fairly minimal. Not much of a head, which dissipates rapidly."
12oz draft pour into snifterloudy boasts a golden orange hue and floats a fluffy 1/8in head of white foam that quickly disippates to a little more than a few isolated whispy islands and an edge-hugging ring. With agitation sheets of lacing leg it down to the ring.
Fantastic hoppy delight! From smell to taste and aftertaste the experience changes throughout the drink.. many different hop flavors and refreshing end was amazing!
"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 1 finger cream colored head, good retention and lacing. Pale luminous opaque golden in the glass. Smells of pineapple, citrus and some vegetal hops. Taste is initially pineapple, mango and slightly sweet orange juice, bitterness is a little more than most of these styles, think that is why I like this one, good sharp finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. One thing I want to point out is the shelf stability of this beer is better than any other NEIPA I have had. Did a blind tasting with this, Haze and Green and this was my top pick."
Had ontap from Growler garage Santa Rosa FL July 2018
Re-review a week later : 
"Grapefruit, pepper, dandelion greens, interesting take on a NEIPA."
Taste & smell is heavy pineapple.
Hazy and tasty!
Quick thought on this great beer.
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a nice head and lacing
Sometimes I get lucky and my brother in law from Ohio brings me some of this!
"Pours a slightly turbid, foggy orange with a finger of white head. Head forms fairly freely, and retains fairly well. Good lacing left behind. Aroma is pine, resin, and dank hops right at the front. They sorta stick and linger in the nostrils. A whiff of mango add a little extra depth, while throwing in a dash of sugar to the more bittery hop aroma. Flavor profile is mango, grapefruit, pine, and resin. It opens up with those sweet tropical fruit notes, but quickly works its way into a more bitter, evergreen forest-like finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a nice crisp finish that just has a touch of harsh carbonation to it. Overall, hops hit both sides of the spectrum, but balance and work each other out. Well rounded and developed IPA. "
"Golden body, matte and clear. Two and a half finger white, rocky head that dissipates to a patchy cap. Spare and sticky lace."
"32oz growler filled at the brewery hours ago. Pours a murky burnt orange color with no head. Trace amounts of lacing. The aroma is a sweet blend of mango, papaya, peaches and green tea. The taste is tons of ripe and juicy peaches with mango and papaya. Slightly herbal and piney towards the finish but the main flavor I get is the peach. Lightly toasted malts peek through at the end along with more herbal/piney notes. Mouthfeel is my only issue since there seems to be very little carbonation but it doesn't hurt it very much. Dry. Overall, a solid IPA I'll grab again."
"Pours a beautiful light amber with lovely, opaque yeast suspension. Smells like a tropical fruit basket: strawberries, peaches, mango. The taste is juicy, but not in an unpleasantly sweet way. A natural burst of fruit flavor atop a delightfully pungent hop punch. The best part of the beer is the finish: too many juicy IPAs finish sweet but this goes dry at just the right time, leaving your lips puckering and needing another sip. Simply my favorite Conmecticut IPA and a perfect example of what a single hop beer can be."
"Another great offering from Steady Habit Brewing. These guys know what they're doing. Pours hazy, 1"" pillow head. Tropical, fruity notes. Pineapple, mango and papaya. The Mosaic is very evident. I already see myself finishing off both 750 ml bottles tonight. Do yourself a favor if you're in the central CT area and swing by Steady Habit."
Yet another very solid hoppy offering from Steady Habit. I really like what they have going on over there and will be sure to stop by to try everything they put out.
"The smell is really amazing, and the taste follows suit. The mosaic hops create a myriad of tropical flavors ranging from citrus and mango, to pineapple and papaya. Poured fresh from a growler it didn't leave much head (strangely), and the mouthfeel was a tad too thin. I would like to revisit this one for a second opinion, but the smell and taste were above reproach. Definitely worth seeking."
Pours beautiful clear straw gold. Smells of hops. Drinks smooth with hoppy bitter taste throughout. Very drinkable.
"11/2/18 (Okemos, MI): 16 oz canned 10/2/18 3:25, multiple pours into snifter, gift from brother. Light golden pour, fluffy head, heavy carbonation, leaves nice white lacing. Light citrus aroma and balanced taste, slightly sweet citrus, bitter dry hops, excellent. Mouth feel creamy, very smooth, carbonation holds well. Overall very good IPA."
Absolutely a disappointment
"Had on tap. Finally got to try this after years of keeping an eye out. Was worried it wouldn't stand up to the ipas of today, I was happy to be proven wrong. As much as I love dry hopped ipas, this reminded me how much I loved wet hopped ones. The citra hops meld so well with the underlying caramel malts, giving you a burst of wet sweetness, that then is dominated by delicious hop bitterness. Good citrus fruit, grass and floral hops notes in smell as well. So much flavor for a single ipa."
"What a great beer, just ridiculously pricey in WI"
"Canned October 1st, 2018. Pours a slightly foggy amber with a thin white head. Smell is mostly dank hops with some citrus notes. Flavor has notes of grapefruit, pineapple, grass, and hop bitterness, all in abundance. Medium carbonation and body. Solid, very flavorful IPA, and I love Citra hops to boot, so this was the year to beat."
Can dated 10-1-18. Pours a clear honey yellow with a large white pillow of a head that lasts and leaves good lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit. Flavor is sweet ripe tropical fruit with a slight hop bitter finish. Feel is soft medium bodied. Overall a pretty nice beer without being too special. Expected more from a 4 day old beer from this brewery.
"Difficuly to rate as it is so different. Get a lot of papaya, the sour culture cuts through it, and then the hop flavours come in. So inventive and a magnificent effort by the brewers to keep that level of balance. I would love to see how they make this, i think if i tried a homebrew i would get it wrong 100 times before it was remotely drinkable. As i finish it off i get hints of the other flavours, but for me the (ripe!) papaya was dominant."
"tastes like papaya juice with a hint of hops. typical goodness from HVB. I didn't get much coconut or green tea at all, though you could just call this a papaya IPA sour and still have it hit a home run."
"This one pours a super hazy and milky looking orange, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing."
"A: Going by the seemingly standardized appearance of these Hudson Valley sour IPAs, this is a shade or two darker than the norm, maybe 3:1 on the orange juice : pineapple juice ratio. Deep gold with hints of burnt orange. Typical thin, compact head formation that dissipates without much time. "
"Crazy delicious sour IPA---smell is always tart grapefruit, but taste is as usual very unique.... juicy papaya tropical goodness with a nice coconut finish--especially as it warms... green tea is in there as well just more subtle... taste like eating a whole roll of life-savor tropical fruit candies--with that rare coconut one in the mix..."
"This beer is insane. The apotheosis of HVB achievements and the style they’ve essentially created and mastered (sour lactose laden blended hoppy beer with fruit purée). Just explosively flavorful and at the same time beautifully balanced. Not gimmicky at all, just a tremendously drinkable and appealing beer. Paired this with handmade Shanghai dumplings and noodle dishes and the moderate sourness and fruit sweetness, with the subtle hop bitterness in the finish, cleansed the palette and held its own against another tremendously flavorful offfering. Wow."
"Really great beer. Perfect hazy look, tight pearl head. Smell is sweet grapefruit and spices. Taste is wonderful grapefruit, hint of honey, with a creamy mouthfeel and a citrus twang on the finish that is awesome"
"Super hazy NE IPA body with a fizzy, off-white head that fades to a sparse, soapy residue atop. Aromas of pineapple, fruit punch, sweet citrus. Loads of fruit character in the flavor. Tangy acidity with a light body. Prickly carbonation a la soda. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"well, holy shit. is this the new direction? and to think we were enamored with 'west coast IPAs' just a few years ago..... lots of flavor. slight tartness. very nice!"
Smells like straight grapefruit
"This one pours a super hazy and quite milky looking yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing."
"Hudson Valley continues to impress with this delicious entry into their sour/brunch IPA series. This one falls somewhere in the cross-section of Crush! orange soda, melted Creamsicle pops, and fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice. It's offers both tartness and sweetness, but the two keep each other in check wonderfully, resulting in an extremely intense yet easy/pleasurable drinking experience. Ride of bright, creamy citrus flavors is capped on the finish by a delicate, somewhat grassy, somewhat minty bitterness that is likely the contribution of the Motueka dry hopping. The feel is medium with even, soft carbonation, accenting the refreshing drinkability of this beer. Another delicious creation by these alchemists!"
"Just a fantastic beer in every way. I went to HV for my first release and came away impressed by everything from the brewery, the people, vibe and most importantly the beers. All were excellent and this was the best. So juicy - smooth and full of citrus goodness with just the right amount of sour tartness. You get that nice juicy IPA hop hit up front and then the wonderful sour/tartness on the back end. Quite possibly the best IPA I had in 2017. Well done."
"L: hazy to murky gold blanketed by 3"" of persistent, white lacy foam"
"Vanilla is just a tad too strong, but overall really good milkshake IPA."
"This beer has made me rethink everything I've thought I've know about beer. It's outstanding. It tastes like a creamy orange julius, but it's a BEER! My mind is blown."
"Overall an amazing beer. The look is a cloudy orange. You put your nose up to the glass and are greeted by a sweet citrus fragrance. I could just sit and smell this beer. The taste is a soft more smooth orange, like an orange dreamcicle. This is perhaps one of my favorites. Try it and enjoy!"
"This one pours a very hazy and glowing orange, with a fluffy whipped looking head, and lots of lacing."
Super hazy/cloudy pale gold. White head with lace. 
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. 
Quite bitter as one would expect to go along with the nice aroma from dry hopping. Poured a nice head with medium bubbles. Not creamy which is OK. I’d be happy to find a glass of this anytime.
"A great IPA, if you enjoy a strong hop flavor and citrus. It finishes somewhat bitter, but that reenforces what it is."
Mighty tasty. Pretty good
Draft. Clear amber appearance. Medium malty back with citrus + earthy front.
"Near perfect NW IPA, crisp and biting. Orange amber body with substantial creamy head. aroma of hops, and more hops. Taste , too. Barley Brown’s knocked this one out of the park."
"Copper gold, with a bit of haze and a frothy soapy white head. Smell is light, not much there, just pine. Flavor is big green chlorophyll. Lots of pine, and bitter green lettuce. Good but one note for me. Finish is extra dry from the huge amount of hops and lasts a long time. Not my favorite. Hops are tasty, bright and zesty, but this just seems like an attempt to cram in a bunch of hops without really crafting a balanced beer. Not my style."
"My hometown Brewery and Pub.... well it's 65 miles away, but I call it home."
"Chill haze light amber without much head, but what's there leaves some good drippy lace. "
"This hits all the right notes for an IPA. Piney and citrus in abundance. Intensly hoppy finish, as it should be. All around solid IPA. Don’t pass this one up."
"On tap at Engine House 9 in Tacoma, WA."
"Poured from a growler at a day old. Pours a deep golden amber with a thick tan foam head. The nose is of malt and light tree bark. Taste is malt forward. Caramel sweetness to it along with herbs, grasses and a very faint citrus lemon peel. The lemon peel is almost herbal tea like or medicinal. Medium to full body with a semi crisp clean finish. Good beer."
L - What you'd expect an old school west coast IPA to look like - classic color. Lacing on the glass hints at what's in store.
Super solid and smooth.
Reviewed from notes taken in Fall 2014.
"From the bottom of the can: ""0461 CANNED ON 08/23/18 16:15"""
"A: Amber in color, with a light tan head. "
"I received this from @vidblain in a BIF box. Canned 8/20/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It pours a color something between orange and ruby with a huge, milk-white head and lots of clinging lacing. The nose is decidedly malt-forward. There's not much fruit but a fragrant smell of hops. The taste is interesting: it's malty with roasty barley and a hint of caramel or toffee up front but the complex hop bill of Amarillo, Simcoe, Cascade, and Warrior is bitter and bites hard. It finishes with a bitter after taste. I really like how the bitter hops and sweet malt battle for supremacy. This ale has a nice, creamy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and at 6.7% ABV a second pour is a must. Overall, I like this a lot! It's an IPA with an attitude."
Nice IPA and good bitterness. Easier to drink than Todd.
Nice beer if you like hops
"Poured from a 16 OZ can into a pint glass at Beer Head Pub in Schaumburg, IL. Another great beer from Surly. The appearance was a cloudy orange color with a medium sized white head. The taste and aroma was malt and pine."
"Hazy golden color. Aroma has dough notes with some grassy and floral hops. Taste is balanced, a bit acrid, dry, astringent. Decent but not Tree House level."
"this was super clean and crisp... some citrus peel and grapefruit notes, a mellow sweet and bready malt profile balances it out and the mothfeel is very soft. smooth easy drinker!"
"Pours a hazy light golden color, like watered down orange juice. Weak nose, faint orange, citrus, sharp pungent aroma. Very hop forward, not a lot in the malt department. Sharp and crisp, loads of mango, papaya, pineapple, orange, lemon. Big mixture of citrus and tropical flavors. Crisp and refreshing, nicely carbonated. Overall this is a very drinkable IPA, just not my style (tastes overly dry hopped)."
01/03/17 stamped on the bottom of a tall can
Poured from can. Dark golden color. Hazy. Not getting much nose. Taste is thick and juicy. Slightest linger on the tongue.
"A: Chalky gold to start. Starts to glow over time, burst of orange more and more apparent. Creamy off-white white. Frothy, whispy lacing. "
"Deep muddied gold, opaque, topped with an ivory head of foam. Aromas and flavors of dank orange citrus pith, has earthy and musky undertones with brighter points of tangy juice. Medium-light weight and feel, smooth with a slowly gripping bitterness. Moderate sweetness and soft carbonation. Spot-on for a Citra IPA. 3/10/17 canning."
"Had this on cask, not bad actually. "
Fresh at Stone today. Deliciously dank and hoppy.
Strong tasting IPA
I had this one at the brewery and liked it so much I brought a growler back to my hotel. 
"Soapy head and apricot opaque color. Aroma is caramel, bready malt, and pine. Taste follows the nose, but quickly disappears with no lingering bitterness or aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with prickly carbonation. Harsh and not very balanced. Overall a rather unremarkable IPA."
Big thanks to richj1970 for another hoppy treat form Al.
Great combo of malt backbone and hoppy fruity flavor. Unbelievable GP doesn’t make this a year round option
This is by far the best IPA in Birmingham. Great color with a Citrus punch that does not disappoint on taste. Well balanced carbonation that feels like a hoppy IPA is supposed to (Sculpin). Seasonal in cans is a big mistake IMO. This needs to be a Signature brew enjoyed by the masses year round.
I usually look to Good People when I'm seeking a more hop forward IPA in Bham. Hitchhiker takes a step back from that a little and showcases a little more citrus and fruity notes while still preserving that piney hopiness. This is a quite balanced beer with good amber/apricot color. Medium carbonation and is my favorite of their IPA arsenal.
"Golden near amber draft pour to shaker, no head but good lacing. Pineapple, dank nose, a little kiwi. Full flavor that is mainly bitter, some fruit and malt notes follow. Above average body and below average carbonation."
12 oz can with a 2017 date stamp. 
"Big, floral nose. hoppy taste with a punch of citrus. Lingering aftertaste."
"This is a pretty good little beer that I got as a extra in a trade. Pours a golden cooper with huge white head. Nose is floral and light fresh citrus. Floral up front on taste followed by fresh cut grapefruit, light Lemmon zest, grass and caramel malts. A small bit of that sticky quality I so love. Medium body with a crisp finish"
Poured from a 12 oz can into a clear glass tulip. PKG 03/02/17 on bottom rim of can.
Half pour at brewery. Clear golden color with fluffy white head.
"On Tap at Mike Taproom Largo,FL Pours a golden color with a fresh small white head. Smell was floral,citrus and dank hop. Taste followed nose was crisp with hops and citrus forward . Mouth feel crisp with some pine bitterness in finish but floral/tropical hops are in charge here. A delightful IPA."
"On-tap at Cycle Brewing, St. Petersburg, FL"
"Received as a gift from a fellow BA. I was quite impressed. This beer had pretty much everything I look for in an IPA. Not as in your face hoppy as some-which I happen to like, just a very enjoyable topnotch IPA"
"Sent a crowler by my brother for Christmas. Cloudy, dark orange, very little in the way of foam or lacing, lots of sediment at the end of the crowler. Dank, citrusy notes on the nose. Taste is a balance of mildly bitter and citrusy hops. Zesty and dank, gentle alcohol presence. Pretty good."
Exceptionally good.
Lightly-hazed golden color with a finger-and-a-half of off-white foam head. Decent retention and nice rings of lacing.
"On tap at Lawson's Finest Liquids in Waitsfield, VT."
A-Pours a very nice amber color with a slight head and lacing
Poured into a becher pint glass.
"16oz can from the brewery. Pours a golden brown with an inch of head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is lots of sweet pine and citrus hops. Bready malts as well. The taste is grapefruit, citrus peel and grassy hops along with a big punch of pine. Piney finish with a good amount of the malt flavor. Tastes boozier than the ABV. Oily mouthfeel and nicely bitter."
"grassy, dank, floral, slightly spicy pine, some grapefruity and orange notes dancing around, mellow bready/crackery malt, and a hint of mango in the background. very clean and balanced, a classic west coast style IPA."
"GREAT COLOR AND AROMA IN THIS IPA. LAWSON'S DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. Hard to get on Ohio, usually have to have someone guy for us and send to us. Very nice Brew!"
Wish this was more readily available! This fucker is delightful and I'm a bigger fan over their sunshine line
Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip.

"Poured from tap at Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT into their flute."
Nice malty backbone. This beer has changed over the years but still an excellent IPA.
Canned on 07/31/18 stamped on bottom of 12 oz. can:
Very fun of the mill IPA. Really nothing truly special about this IMHO. The stouts from Cigar City Breweing are something really special. This was mundane.
"ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE IPA OF ALL TIME!! Had the pleasure of trying this on draught multiple times on vacation in Clearwater, then I moved to Tampa shortly after. This beer is so great on draft and surprisingly great out of a can. Unfortunately they don’t bottle it but if you don’t live in an area that sells it often you should get your hands on it. You won’t regret it if you truly love IPA’s."
Solid beer for what it is
"Don't understand the 4.0s and higher. This is a run of the mill west coast style IPA, dime a dozen in my opinion. Very simple taste profile, mainly bitterness. Not that it's bad, but not a 4.28 average at the time of this review. That's getting into Treehouse range, and there's simply no way this beer flies at that altitude. Much prefer Sam Adams NEIPA and Rebel to this, as well as Voodoo Ranger, SN Celebration Ale and Torpedo, Lagunitas Sucks and Maximus at this price point or lower."
"L: coppery color, clear"
"awesome stuff, there is a reason everyone in minnesota is talking about this beer as one of the best wet hops in the game, i have to agree, maybe my favorite beer from these guys so far. its clear and rich brassy golden and frothy white headed from the tap, with a stunning aroma, even shocking, of mosaic, cleaner and fresher than i have really ever known it to be. they must use a ton of hops here, its oily and west coasty and kind of rich to me, loaded with lupulin and myrcene and all the other goodies in here, concentrated and intense for a wet hop, with just a pale malt base it seems, thats all that needs to be there. i get none of the now tired mosaic fruitiness, its elevated way beyond that pineapple citrus thing, and none of the cat pee character i sometimes get when its over dry hopped, its perfect here, a wonderful version of itself, an example to others i hope, so darn good. some bitterness to which is nice, but this drinks like a california pale ale to me, and i mean that as a high compliment. worthy of the hype, this is next level hoppy beer. others from outside the state have no idea what they are missing here, this should be in the national conversation. it really took my by surprise. ill look forward to this each fall when i am up north! as good as mosaic gets."
Appearance - pours clear golden color with big fluffy white head that settles to a fairly thick cap. lots of spotty lacing.
"Pours light Amber. Tall foamy, Whitehead the Fades fast with light lacing."
"Pours on the yellow side of a clear amber with a white head. Good retention and lacing. Floral and slightly spicy hop presence on the nose with a touch of citrus. The taste is grapefruit and grassy notes in abundance, with a sweet malt presence to back it up. Drinks more like an APA than an IPA. Smooth, lightly carbonated, and medium-bodied. Great beer as always from Castle Danger."
"I have no idea how people could rate this beer poorly. If this is you, you need your taste buds revoked."
"Mosaic IPA pours a copper color, with a big long lasting and lacing head. Big fresh hoppy aroma, that can fill the room. Taste is big, hints of earth, lots of tropical fruit, grapefruit and big hop flavors that finishes sweet. Good body and feel. Overall fantastic IPA, big flavors, complex, does finish sweet."
Golden orange color. Clear. White head. On tap.
"Poured from a pint can 2 weeks fresh. Aroma is of melon and floral notes. Taste is Intense and pure mosaic at its best. One finger spongy head dissipates soon but laces nicely. Amber and slightly opaque. This may beat Sosus for the best mosaic I've had. Flavor matches the nose but is more intense. Creamy mouth feel with appropriate carbonation bordering Niro feel. Now having a second the next day and this is legit. The flavor is insane--one that the nose hints toward, but the nose isn't huge."
"This beer pours a slightly murky orange with a large, uniform head. The aroma is bold and vibrant, with huge guava, passionfruit, honeydew, pineapple, mango, candied pineapple, and overripe apricot and peach. The flavor is still vibrant, but not overly assertive, with soft guava, papaya, candied pineapple, mango, and overripe peach. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy carbonation. Overall this is a pretty wow beer - the aroma is huge, but the flavor much more demure, all leading to a very drinkable, sensuous beer."
First purchase (10/17/17) of the 2017 offering (stamped canning date is 10/10/17).
"Canned 03/28/18, ‘BLEED BLUE’."
"Really good single IPA. Hazy, good smell to it, but it's not a double IPA which people forget when they think it's got a lesser flavor and smell than their DIPAs. For an IPA, it's extremely good and smooth. Velvety."
16 oz. can dated 09/12/17
"Really hazy golden color with white head. Aroma has some caramel malt and slightly dank hops. Taste starts juicy, just slightly sweet, continues with ""green"" hop notes and finishes with some white grapes and light bitterness. Medium to full bodied, really smooth but also well carbonated. Overall it's another great juicy IPA from Monkish."
Got this from a buddy in trade - 
"From a can poured in a tulip glass. Friend brought back from NC. This is a really well made, traditional American IPA. Pour is a beautiful copper gold color. Small head with lacing that lingers. Smell is nice, intense resiny peach and slight piney grass, with a hint of bready malt scent in the backend. Taste is well balanced bitter and malt. I taste the tangerine, pine, grass, light caramel, lemon zest and sweet malt flavors. Maybe a touch of biscuit. Definitely not a session IPA; substantial body and thickness to the beer. Body is well-balanced. This isn’t as juicy and tropical as more recent IPAs, definitely reminding me of really good IPAs from ~5 years ago. This isn’t my favorite hop combination, but it is purposeful and just so well-executed that I had to rate it highly."
Hopping dropping and rolling
Very good. Had pint can at airport bar in Charlotte. Opened with blast of juicy fruit and finished a little heavier on the pine. Smooth decent body for a can suggests good malt backbone. So does rich bready taste that fills out /helps but stays in background to hop attack.
Good solid IPA!
"Poured from a 16 oz can dated 7/12/18, into a Willi Becher pint glass."
Love the fruity finish on this beer. The hops are great
"Plastic glass at CLE airport. Wanted an iPA so not sure what I was getting. Nice surprise. Nice color no real head (bartender was careful not to have one). But nice lacing in the glass. Nice citrus hop aroma which matches the taste. The citrus does not overpower the nice malts which leaves to nice overall flavor. Was surprised with the apv, tastes like a good summer drinking beer but a bit high for a hot afternoon. No faults. If you like a citrus ipa you will like it!"
"The appearance was a hazy golden bronzed orange color with a thin white layer of foaminess. No lacing. The smell had started off with some sweet citrus and bitter grapefruit rind. Light sweet onion dankiness strolling in underneath. The flavor copies the smell pretty much the same. Light sweet danky onion and citrus aftertaste. Semi-smooth sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent ssessionably low carbonated smooth feel. Overall, great AIPA, definitely would have again!"
Very cloudy with a dirty gold color. Moderate head but it leaves a good blanket of lace. 
"Almost completely opaque orange-yellow with a moderate, bright white dense fuzz settling to a persistent thick collar."
"This beer pours a very cloudy dark golden yellow color with a three finger, frothy off white head. Retention is excellent and there are many hanging chunks of lacing left on the glass."
"Can from the Fort Point brewery in Boston, MA, whislt in town for EBF. Can was two thirds full :( Pours moderately hazy with minimal head and nice lacing, smells and tastes like spicy dank citrus candy, medium to thin bodied. Quite nice, great hop nip."
A: vibrant pale orange color with some darker amber notes towards the middle. Bright white head
"folks are really loving this one it seems like, and its delicious, and obviously highly preferable to just about any of the blood orange ipa types that have flooded the market in recent years, but they have a winner with this ipa, it really doesnt need any tweaks. it always seems weird to me when a brewery takes an amazing flagship-esque beer like this one and makes changes, its famous for a reason. that said, the mango added tastes fresh to me, its not too sweet, and most importantly of all, its dosed lightly enough to accent the base beer without taking it over, i would have been real disappointed if this covered up the goodness that is the original. the hops and the mango go great together, and this being on the maltier side anyway, there is a lot of support in body so the mango doesnt change the feel too much. its a nice fresh sunny mango flavor, juicy and natural, and it works. i think it brings out the sweetness of the malt a bit much for my personal taste, but the beer remains very balanced. i definitely still prefer the original, its a staple, but this is a nice little variant, nice fresh mango and not too much of it."
"Mango keeps getting me on some of my favorite IPAs, and this is no exception. I keep thinking more fruit might throw off the balance, but maybe I just like them that way."
Mango mama pours a darker cooper color with a small head. Hoppy ipa aroma with sweet mango notes. Taste is mainly iPad with subtle sweet mango flavors. Good body and flavor. Overall nice ipa with subtle mango.
"On tap at the Tap, into a tulip, pours a clear deep orange-Amber with minimal off white head that dissipates quickly. Some bread and a lot of overripe dark mango on the nose. No hoppy bite on the tongue, no bright tropical flavors...a lot of mango pulp, though...some depth of flavor, but not much complexity. Disappointed. Give me the regular any day...I've heard such good things about this one that I really want this to be a flawed batch, even though I don't think there are technical flaws here."
On tap at Town Hall.
More flower than fruity. Overall good beer
"Aug 2018...pours brownish dirty gold, thick and murky with patchy ringed white foam. Strong citrus fruity nose - tropical fruits abound. Sharp citrus tart open, lemon, strong rind flavor. Malty thick taste. Juicy. Really tasty citrus loaded IPA>."
16 oz can the bottom reads : (Billy Mays Haze IPAS 4 Dayz YAY! ) 7/20/18 opened on 8/8/18 update on 10/26/18.
"Really great soft east coast IPA. Pours a hazy soft yellow, smell is citrus. Taste follows the nose, very drinkable. Orange, mango, pineapple with a malty back end. Excellent brew."
"Very proud to have this coming out of ATX (Austin, TX ) one of the go tos around town."
Had this from draft to go with some duck sausage served with onion and dates. Excellent combo!
My favorite IPA in Austin. I have tried IPAs from about 30 different microbreweries as well as many others from other cities and this is still my favorite.
"On tap at Torchy’s Tacos in Austin, TX."
"If you Texans have never had Other Half, this is close enough to have no need to trade for it."
10/1/18 can
gimme moh booze kehd. Double i guess i need.
12 oz. can. Hazy bright orange. Smells of papaya and some orange zest. Malt behind it is substantial as well. Almost smells of oats. Tastes of tangerine and some sweet melon hops. Still has almost an oaty malt flavor. A little sweet and a little toasty. Medium body. Faint bitterness. Excellent.
"This one pours a very hazy orange color, with a small foamy head and lots of lacing."
12 oz. can (!!) dated 7/23/18. Purchased at brewery 7/28/18 and poured into Carton Dubvariant glass.
"Pours with an aggressive very white head. Took a bit to wait for it to settle down. Pale yellow body and quite cloudy to pulpy OJ looking. Very nice citrus, tropical fruit hop aroma. Even a little sweet. No particular resin quality. "
Love a cloudy mysterious dense delectable IPA LIKE THIS ONEO
"Straight up pineapple flavors. Way more tropical than any ""tropical"" beer I have ever had. Personally I want a bit of orange in this to help balance the pineapple, but still very good."
"Very hazy on the pour. Decent carbonation. Mosaic hops, citrus and some hay on the nose. The taste has some really nice flavors with the hops, citrus and dry earthy tones on he finish. Feel is dry and thin on the end which was nice with the flavor combo but could use some beefing up."
"Tangerine, orange creamsicle, lemon, grapefruit juice, melon and hints of pine. Zesty. Cracker malt. Dank and delicious. Finishes fairly dry. Nice level of sweetness. Really good."
Can dated 10/25/18. Poured into tulip.
Had this on 2018-07-07 at their Fermataria brewery and again on 2018-08-04 from a 16oz canned on 2018-06-28.
"Really nice light IPA, crisp and refreshing, honey comes through nicely."
"Like a Focal Banger clone, except way less lighter. My favorite sweaty hops note."
Can poured into a sampling glass
L- Pours a surprisingly light colored beer that's golden with a slight carbonation visible. Three fingered head is present.
Light copper colored with a heavy amount of moderate to large sized sediment suspended within. There's a quarter inch to an inch of brown frothy foam resting on top. The aroma is of oranges and citrus hops. I'm tasting plenty of citrus hops and then some strong undercurrents of blood orange and the corresponding acidity. The mouth is dense and moderately acidic.
"Had this on tap in a nice Frosty Glass. While I don't have quite the pallet that most of you all do... I thought immediately, ""this is definitely one of my favorites coming out of Georgia."" This brew is an enjoyable experience!"
Only 2 months old but tasted stale and out of class. Not sure why rating is so high here.
"Poured into a Spiegelau tulip from a can dated sometime in April (no date on the can itself, but I know the date on the 6-pack I bought was sometime in April). Liquid is bright cloudy orange, and the pour kicks up a solid head that fades pretty quickly to a ring and a film."
Poured from a 12 OZ can into a pint glass. The appearance is a hazy golden yellow with a large white head. The aroma is fresh citrus. The taste is a mice mix of hops and oranges.
Poured from 12 oz can into Duvel tulip. No freshness date.
"12oz can, undated, assumed to be fresh, poured into a 14oz snifter glass."
I know i've been on BHB tear. Had this this last summer i cannot wait for it to come back on the shelves. great looking can. what an amazing beer. yes!
"Poured from a bomber dated 2/25, I had been wanting to try this one for awhile so didn't pay attention to the date when I grabbed it. The smell after opening the bottle was great, very citrusy. Poured a beautiful burnt orange color but was loaded with sediment, not sure if that's normal or not. Let it settle some and drank gently. Taste was grapefruit with good carbonation. I'll try a fresh one if I find one but seriously thinking about drain pouring this one due to the sediment."
